<!-- When Joseph Schumpeter’s book first appeared, the New English Weekly
predicted that ‘for the next five to ten years it will certainly remain a
work with which no one who professes any degree of information on
sociology or economics can afford to be unacquainted’. The prophecy has
been justified, but how much more fully than its maker anticipated. A
generation later, it is more widely read than when it first appeared. The
mixed economy has become established in North America as well as in
the countries of the European Community, while in the socialist countries
there has been a move towards various forms of decentralisation and of
a market economy. In this new context the issues that Schumpeter raises
are still matters of lively debate. -->

I N T R O D U C T I O N
This is a book to be read not for the agreement or disagreement it provokes but for the thought it invokes. John Kenneth Galbraith
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy is one of the great classics in
twentieth century social science. What makes Schumpeter’s book so brilliant
are three things in particular: its novel view of democracy; its heretic
analysis of the workings of the capitalist economy; and its provocative
argument that capitalism is bound to disappear—not because of its failure,
but because of its success. Schumpeter’s style, it should be emphasized,
also makes the book a pleasure to read: “Even if, in places, you may dislike
what Schumpeter says”, as one reviewer put it, “you will like the way he
says it”. 1 In this introduction I shall say, first, a few words about the writing
of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy and its place in Schumpeter’s
output as a whole (Part I). I shall provide then a reader’s guide to
Schumpeter’s book, which may be of assistance to those who are
approaching it for the first time. This will also enable the hurried reader
to go straight to the most important parts of Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy (Part II). The third and final part of the introduction deals with
the contemporary relevance of Schumpeter’s work. Schumpeter, for
example, argued that socialism is about to replace capitalism—an opinion
that seems totally wrong today, especially after the disintegration of state
socialism in the Soviet Union and East-Central Europe (Part III).

The story of how Schumpeter came to write Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy can be sketched in a few lines. Towards the end of the 1930s,
Schumpeter decided to write a small book on socialism. To cite his wife,
Elizabeth Boody Schumpeter: “J.A.S. had finished his monumental Business
Cycles in 1938 and sought relaxation in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy,
which he regarded as a distinctly ‘popular’ offering that he expected to finish
in a few months.” 2 Schumpeter’s book, however, took longer to complete than
he had expected, and it was not published until 1942. It was very well received,
both in England and in the United States, and its reputation grew as further
editions were published in 1947 and 1950. Today, according to John Kenneth
Introductionx

Galbraith, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy is the main work by which
Schumpeter is remembered. 3

A summary account of this type fails, however, to do justice to the making of
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy in at least two important ways. First,
Schumpeter’s work draws very much on his earlier research and personal experience.
In the preface to the first edition, Schumpeter says that his book was the result of “almost
forty years’ thought, observation and research on the subject of socialism”.4 Gottfried
Haberler—one of the foremost authorities on Schumpeter—has added that the book
“sums up, brings up-to-date and slightly modifies the result of Schumpeter’s life-long
work and study [not only of socialism but of economic theory as well]”.5 There is also
the fact that the period during which Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy was written
was a particularly turbulent and dramatic one in Schumpeter’s life. He was, for example,
investigated during these years by the FBI for possible espionage, and there were
rumours, (as there still are), that he was pro-Nazi. He was also going through a personal
crisis—reevaluating himself and his work. Through its exuberant style, Capitalism,
Socialism and Democracy may give the impression that it was written by someone
who was happy and carefree, but that was far from the case.
If Schumpeter’s book has its origin in events “almost forty years ago”, we
need to know more about Schumpeter around the year 1900. At this time the
young Schumpeter, (who was born in 1883 in the small town of Triesch, the
son of a textile manufacturer), was about to enter the University of Vienna. He
had just finished his studies at Theresianum, an exclusive private school for the
elite of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It might be that he felt out of place at this
school as he came from the provinces, and had been admitted only because of
his stepfather’s connections. In any case, he received excellent grades at
Theresianum and was eager to begin his university studies. From early on
Schumpeter had been interested in economics and his ambition was to become
an important economist.

With Carl Menger at the University of Vienna, economics was a very exciting
topic to study there around the turn of the century. Schumpeter had excellent
teachers, among them Eugen von Boehm-Bawerk and Friedrich von Wieser.
There was also a number of brilliant Marxist students at the university who forced
the other students—including Schumpeter—to take Marxism and socialist
economics seriously. Schumpeter was happy to debate them, but he made it clear
that he was sceptical of Marxism. He received his doctorate in 1906, and by
this time, had made the acquaintance of several Marxist students who soon were
to hold prominent positions in the socialist movement, among them Otto Bauer
and Rudolf Hilferding 6
.
After some years abroad—mainly in England and Egypt—Schumpeter settled
down to a conventional career as an economist. During the years 1908–1914 he
published three brilliant books in economics and advanced to full professor at the

Introduction xi

University of Graz, after some time at the University of Czernowutz. The most
important of these books was the second, The Theory of Economic Development
(1911). Schumpeter’s ambition with this work was to complement Walras’ economic
theory with one where economic change was analyzed in a stringent, analytical
manner. Schumpeter’s theory was centered around the entrepreneur: he argued that
change in economic life always starts with the actions of a forceful individual and
then spreads to the rest of the economy.
As Schumpeter’s professional success grew, so did his personal ambitions. A
number of prominent economists in the Austro-Hungarian Empire had held high
political positions, and Schumpeter was clearly interested in getting one of these.
During the First World War he approached a number of people he thought could
further his political career, including former professors and ministers. He also wrote
secret memoranda, which he hoped would influence the Emperor and the circles
surrounding the Emperor. From these writings, which were discovered some years
ago, a picture emerges of Schumpeter’s political ideas when he was in his early
thirties. He was firmly conservative as a young man: he supported the Emperor,
though he also felt that some form of tory-democracy would be suitable for Austria-
Hungary. He did not believe in democracy for its own sake, but rather saw it as a
means to modernize the Empire.

After the First World War the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated—
and with it Schumpeter’s hope for a high position. To his surprise, however,
he was asked by the Social Democrats in 1919 to become finance minister
in a coalition government. He accepted—immediately—and it seemed he
had reached one of his most cherished goals. But his joy was to be shortlived—
he was forced to resign after little more than half a year in office. The main
reason for his dismissal was his inability to get along with the Social
Democrats, especially Otto Bauer. Why the Social Democrats had thought
that Schumpeter, who was a convinced conservative, would be eager to carry
out a reformist policy of the type that Otto Bauer and his colleagues favored,
is something of a mystery. In any case, his resignation in October 1919
represents the end of his political career.

Having served as a minister Schumpeter was reluctant to return to academic
teaching in Graz, so he stayed in Vienna. Soon an opportunity arose: he was
offered a high position in a small but respected banking firm, the Biedermann
Bank. The reason for the offer was that Schumpeter had been allotted a banking
permit for his political service to the Austrian state, which the Biedermann
Bank needed in order to become a public corporation. He was given a high
salary and a nice title but was not expected to interfere in the bank’s everyday
transactions. Schumpeter, however, kept busy in other ways, mainly as a private
investor and speculator. Initially he was quite successful and even made a small
fortune. In 1924, however, his luck ran out: he went bankrupt and was fired

later from the Biedermann Bank because of the dubious reputation he had
acquired in the business world.

During his years as a financial entrepreneur Schumpeter had little time to
write. Nonetheless he produced a few articles that are of interest in this context.
Of particular importance is the main theme of Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy that now appears for the first time in his writings, namely that
capitalism will undo itself ultimately through its own success. The more
capitalism advances, Schumpeter argued, the more entrepreneurs will be
replaced by bureaucratically-minded managers. The sense of property, which
is so central to capitalist society, will also grow weaker as solid property is
replaced by mere shares.

By the mid-1920s Schumpeter was in a terrible state; he had failed in politics
as well as in business; he had lost his job; and he had huge debts. In 1925, however,
his luck changed and he was offered a good academic position at the University
of Bonn. Around this time also he fell in love and got married. His first marriage
(to a mysterious English woman called Gladys Ricarde Seaver) had been a failure,
but this time he felt that he had met the love of his life. Her name was Annie
Reisinger; she was twenty years younger than Schumpeter; and she was the daughter
of the concierge in the house of Vienna where he had grown up. For a brief time
in Bonn Schumpeter was extremely happy. But in 1926 disaster struck, and in
one stroke his whole family was eliminated: his mother, his wife and his newborn
son all died. He was devastated by the loss. For a long time he was unable to work,
and for comfort he often retreated into a kind of communion with his wife and
mother. He called them die Hasen (roughly, my beloved) and he communicated
with them in his mind and in his diary. From now on, Annie and Schumpeter’s
mother would be the object of a kind of private cult from Schumpeter’s side. When
he was tired or in need of help, he would pray to die Hasen.

When, in 1924, Schumpeter decided to resume his career as an economist,
he knew that he had to produce books as brilliant as his three books from 1908–
1914. This, however, turned out to be harder than he thought, and it was not
until 1939 that his fourth book—Business Cycles—was published. By this time
Schumpeter was working in the United States, at Harvard University, where he
had moved permanently in 1932. During the years 1924–1939 Schumpeter would
several times try to produce a book, but each time he failed. There was first and
foremost a projected book on the theory of money, on which Schumpeter worked
extremely hard but which never materialized. Then there were a number of minor
projects which he tried his hand at, but quickly let die. Among the latter was a
book on socialism, a topic that held his fascination. Schumpeter continued to
follow political events very closely, even though he had promised himself never
to get involved in politics again. He was, for example, greatly annoyed that he
had been unable to predict Hitler’s succession to power in 1933. He was incidentally also unsure whether Hitler would be good or bad for Germany.
“Recent events”, he wrote in a letter dated March 1933, “may mean a catastrophe
but they also may mean salvation”.8 When news reached Schumpeter in 1934
about the recent successes of the Austrian Nazis, he worried that his native country
would be governed from Berlin. According to available information, Schumpeter
detested the Austrian Nazis and was very upset by the Anschluss of 1938.
It was at this time, 1938, that Schumpeter decided to write Capitalism,
Socialism and Democracy. As the giant manuscript for Business Cycles was
coming to finish, Schumpeter began to contemplate a couple of other projects.
For a while he thought of reviving the book on money, which he had worked
very hard on earlier. Other candidates were a book on economic theory and a
revised edition of his history of economic thought from 1914. He finally decided
however to write a small book on socialism; and for a long time he referred to
what was to become Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy as his “book on
socialism”.9 By June 1939 he had prepared a rough outline for his new project
that included the argument that capitalism is about to fail because of its very
success. 10 He was still unsure about the last part of the book, but finally decided
to devote it to a history of socialist parties. The whole project turned out to be
much more time consuming than Schumpeter had initially thought, and the book
was not published until the fall of 1942.

The years 1938–1942, during which Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy
was conceived and executed, were very difficult for Schumpeter on a personal
level. As always, he taught and lectured to excess, which made him irritable
and gave him little time to write. He was also very annoyed with Harvard for a
number of reasons. For one thing, he had very few students left after Keynes’
General Theory (1936) had been discovered at Harvard. He was also on a collision
course with his own department. Its chairman—Harold Burbank—was antisemitic
and a mediocre figure; and his decision in 1940 to deny an appointment to Paul
Samuelson, the department’s star student, infuriated Schumpeter. The same year
he began to negotiate with Yale University, which had extended a very favorable
offer to him. In the last hand, however, Schumpeter decided to stay at Harvard—
only to complain again soon about “[the] stifling atmosphere at Harvard”.11
There was also the issue of politics. Schumpeter detested everything that
Roosevelt stood for and was convinced that he would ruin the United States in
one way or another. Once the Second World War broke out in 1939, he feared the
President would drag the United States into the war, and, using the war as a pretext,
would then extend the grip of Washington over the economy with disasterous
consequences. “A ten-year’s war and a ten-year’s Roosevelt dictatorship”, he wrote
in 1941, “will completely upset the social structure”.12 Schumpeter’s hatred of
Roosevelt reached such proportions that people around him, shocked by his verbal
attacks on the President, began to avoid him. This tendency was strengthened by what Schumpeter said about Nazi Germany and Japan. Schumpeter basically
despised and disliked Hitler—but he feared Stalin and “the Slavs” much more.
During the early stages of the war he suggested that Nazi Germany could keep its
conquered territories since a change in Europe was long overdue anyway.
Incidentally it was this opinion—publicly expressed in a talk in Cambridge in
October 1939—that led the FBI to decide to investigate Schumpeter.13 Schumpeter
was unable to understand why everyone around him was so hostile to Hitler but
not to Stalin. As the war continued, and as Schumpeter began to realize that Hitler
would lose the war, he became increasingly obsessed with the idea that Stalin
must be stopped. After the Allies had defeated Hitler, he felt they should attack
the Soviet Union. “A job half done”, as he put it, “is worse than nothing”.14
Maybe it was Schumpeter’s difficulties at Harvard and the ostracism he
experienced in the social circles of Cambridge that led to Schumpeter’s difficult
personal crisis during the years when he wrote Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy. He began to scrutinize himself and the way he had lived his life, and
he did not like what he saw: he was “worthless”, “frivolous”, “vain” and a “snob”.15
His life had been “a failure”, and so had his work.16 He prayed increasingly to his
mother and his beloved second wife for support. Sometimes he lashed out in anger,
and wrote hateful statements in his diary about the blacks, the Jews and Roosevelt.
While earlier he had vented his anger only in private (primarily, it seems, in his
diary), he now had outbursts in public also. This dark side of Schumpeter was
very difficult for those of his friends who were still loyal to him. While it is the
scholarly consensus that Schumpeter was basically not pro-Nazi, some of his
statements from these years were nonetheless perceived as pro-Hitler. According
to one of Schumpeter’s favorite students at Harvard, for example, “in the Second
World War [Schumpeter] was pro-Hitler, saying to anyone who cared to listen,
that Roosevelt and Churchill had destroyed more than Genghis Khan”. 17

II. A R EADER ’ S G UIDE T O S CHUMPETER ’ S B OOK

Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy consists of around 400 pages of dense
text and would take the average reader around twenty hours of concentrated
reading. For those who can ill afford to invest this amount of time, the following
selection is recommended: Chs. XI–XIV, which give the essence of the argument
why capitalism cannot survive; Chs. XV– XVI, where Schumpeter explicates
why socialism can indeed work; the important Chs. XX–XXIII in which different
theories of democracy are discussed; and the famous chapters on the way that
contemporary capitalism works (Ch. VII, “The Process of Contemporary
Capitalism” and Ch. VIII, “Monopolistic Practices”).
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy is divided into five distinct parts, which
are loosely connected. In the preface to the first edition the author talks about
“the heterogeneous material” of his book and describes its five parts as “almost
Introduction xv
self-contained pieces of material”, connected to one another through “links”
and “bridges”. 18
The book starts with a long and brilliant section on Marx, which is instructive
and enjoyable but not essential for the main argument of the book (Part I, “The
Marxian Doctrine”). The basic innovation in Schumpeter’s analysis of Marx is
the consistent manner in which he separates Marx’s thought into “sociology”
and “economics”. Schumpeter admired Marx’s sociology very much (Ch. II),
but was more sceptical of his economics (Ch. III). However, he credited Marx
very highly for having tried to introduce a dynamic element into economic
analysis—something that Schumpeter himself had tried to do through his theory
of the entrepreneur.
The main argument of the book begins with Part II, entitled “Can Capitalism
Survive?” The first chapters of this part are devoted to an analysis of the way that
contemporary capitalism works, and the reader should pay especial attention to Chs.
VII and VIII with their famous analysis of “creative destruction” and “monopolistic
practices”. Woven through the first chapters of Part II also is an interesting critique
of mainstream economics for being non-dynamic in general and for lacking a realistic
concept of competition in particular. The last chapters of Part II are devoted to a
discussion of why capitalism, in Schumpeter’s opinion, cannot survive (Chs. XI–
XIII): capitalist civilization is falling apart, the bourgeoisie lacks faith in itself, and
so on. These chapters are witty and entertaining, though ultimately not very
convincing, as many critics have pointed out. (See also later in this introduction).
Part III (“Can Socialism Survive?”) is likewise entertaining. Schumpeter argues
that socialism may be superior to capitalism in some aspects (Ch. XXVII); he
discusses whether human nature precludes a socialist society (Ch. XXVIII); and
he tries to establish when a transition from capitalism to socialism can take place
(Ch. XXIX). Of particular interest is Ch. XXVI in which he explains why a
socialist economy is a feasible proposition, which is in contrast to the arguments
of Ludwig von Mises and others.
Part IV (“Socialism and Democracy”) represents one of the high points
in Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy. All the chapters are succinctly
argued and free from the excessive detours that mar some of the other parts
of the book. Chs. XXI and XXII, in which Schumpeter presents and confronts
two different theories of democracy, are especially brilliant (“The Classical
Doctrine of Democracy” and “Another Theory of Democracy”). Part IV also
contains an interesting sketch of what a socialist democracy might look like
(Ch. XXIII, Section III).
The last part of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (Part V, “A Historical
Sketch of Socialist Parties”) is clearly the most expendable. Schumpeter himself
said that his history of socialist parties was only “a sketch” and “woefully
incomplete”, both of which are true.19 The reader will find some interesting details
Introductionxvi
on the Austrian Marxists (many of whom Schumpeter knew), the Bolshevik leaders,
and so on—but not much more. Some editions of Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy (including this one) also contain an appended talk that Schumpeter
gave in 1949, just before his death, entitled “The March into Socialism”. The talk
shows that towards the end of his life Schumpeter was still convinced that the
main thesis of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy was correct: capitalism was
about to be replaced by socialism.
III. T HE C URRENT R ELEVANCE O F S CHUMPETER ’ S B OOK
All three editions of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy (1942, 1947, 1950)
that Schumpeter himself oversaw were very well received by the economics
profession as well as elsewhere. It has been translated into more than a dozen
languages, including Chinese and Japanese, and has spawned a huge number
of articles and a couple of books. 20 Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy is
clearly Schumpeter’s most popular book and there are no signs that interest in
it is waning. Still, it was written more than fifty years ago and events have changed
enormously since it was first published: socialism has collapsed—not capitalism,
as Schumpeter predicted. Is Schumpeter’s analysis in Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy still relevant today?
There are, as I see it, a number of reasons why Schumpeter’s book deserves to be
read as widely today as yesterday. Some of these can be stated in a few lines while
others require more elaboration. Let me start with a simple case: Schumpeter’s analysis
of Marx. The swing to conservatism during the 1980s, in combination with the dramatic
collapse of socialism, has practically wiped out interest in Marxism and also threatens
existing knowledge of it. This represents a major loss as Marx is one of the most important
Western thinkers. Schumpeter’s analysis of Marx in Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy is important in this situation as it represents a well-balanced attempt to
sort out what remains valuable in Marx’s thought. Part I of Schumpeter’s book (“The
Marxian Doctrine”) can be recommended as an excellent introduction to Marxism.
This section is also of interest to those who are familiar already with Marx since it
contains a sophisticated and innovative interpretation of Marx’s ideas.
Schumpeter’s argument about capitalism is considerably more complex and
contradictory than his reading of Marx. It consists principally of two parts which
should be kept separate: an analysis of the way the capitalist economy works,
and the argument that capitalism will fail due to its very success. Schumpeter’s
analysis of the way the capitalist economy works consists of a sharp polemic
with mainstream economics, which he considered lacking on a number of points.
His main assertion was that mainstream economics had failed to understand that
basically capitalism consists of change and cannot be analyzed in static terms.
“Capitalist reality is first and last a process of change”, as he phrased it. 21 It is in
this context that Schumpeter introduces his concept of “creative destruction”.
Introduction xvii
He was also very critical of the current (and present) tendency among economists
to operate with a formalistic and non-realistic concept of competition. Schumpeter
was convinced that perfect competition had never existed; that it never would
exist; and that if it ever came into existence, it would be harmful to the economy.
Big business and monopolies, he pointed out, are to a large extent responsible
for the high standard of living. “Monopolistic practices” are healthy in that they
facilitate expenses on research as well as huge investments. When Capitalism,
Socialism and Democracy was published, Joan Robinson wrote that “Professor
Schumpeter is at his most brilliant [when he discusses competition and
monopoly], and his argument blows like a gale through the dreary pedentry of
static analysis”.22 Quite a few economists, however, were deeply offended by
Schumpeter’s defense of monopoly. 23
The situation is somewhat different with respect to Schumpeter’s famous
argument that capitalism is bound to go under, due to a number of institutional
changes: the entrepreneur is vanishing with the emergence of the modern
corporation; intellectuals are always hostile to capitalism; the old sense of property
is being eroded; and so on. The problem with Schumpeter’s analysis on this
score is that he is contradicted by reality on most points. In short, in areas where
Schumpeter perceived a threat to capitalism, there is no apparent threat at all or,
alternatively, a very minor one. To illustrate this, let us look at two of the alleged
causes for the demise of capitalism: the role of intellectuals in capitalist society
and the relationship of property owners to their property. According to
Schumpeter, as capitalism develops it gives rise to an increasing number of
intellectuals who are basically resentful and hostile to capitalism. The argument,
however, does not accord well with our observations; rather, most intellectuals
appear fairly well integrated into the various institutions in which they work,
and the vocal intelligentsia changes its political opinions at regular intervals,
usually oscillating between pro-capitalism and indifference to economic
questions, and only rarely lapsing into anti-capitalism. In any case, it is simply
not correct to state that Western intellectuals in general have been hostile to
capitalism and that they are likely to be hostile also in the future.
Likewise the sense of property is not being eroded, as Schumpeter claimed,
by the shift from owning physical property (say a factory building) to having
shares in a corporation. Evidence indicates rather that shareholders are as eager
to defend their property as owners of physical property. During the 1980s, for
example, shareholders in the United States reasserted their right to control directly,
and sometimes even to manage, various huge corporations through take-overs
and similar maneouvres. The growth of institutional investors, which because
of the very size of their holdings are more prone to “voice” than to “exit” in the
stock market, is another indicator that Schumpeter was wrong in this matter. It
is of course true that managers in a shareholding corporation have interests that
Introductionxviii
are not identical to those of the owners. Owning shares, however, does not seem
to change one’s attitude to property any more than having bills, as opposed to
gold coins, changes one’s attitude to money.
Schumpeter’s analysis of socialism similarly has its strong and its weak points.
Personally an inveterate foe of socialism, Schumpeter should be applauded for
his objectivity in recognizing that socialism can be democratic. The part of
Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy in which he outlines the structure of a socialist
democracy, is usually forgotten but deserves a better fate (see Ch. XXIII, Part
III). It should also be pointed out that Schumpeter thought that a socialist democracy
might be inherently unstable since socialist society—as opposed to capitalist
society—lacks a strong separation of powers. In socialist society, Schumpeter
pointed out, it would be much easier for the politicians to seize power of the economy
than in capitalist society with its independent private sector. “As a matter of practical
necessity”, Schumpeter said, “socialist democracy may eventually turn out to be
more of a sham than capitalist democracy ever was”.24
Schumpeter’s analysis of socialism is also dubious in other ways. Take, for
example, his analysis of the workings of a socialist economy, as presented most
fully in Ch. XVI. Schumpeter argues here that von Mises is wrong in asserting
that socialism cannot have a rational economy since it lacks markets. The price
mechanism can work in an equally efficient manner in a socialist society as in a
capitalist society, Schumpeter says. This would be the case—theoretically—if
all the citizens in a socialist society received vouchers (representing claims on
the overall production of goods and services) and used these to shop in state-
run shops. These shops, Schumpeter says, would then regulate the price in
accordance with the demand of the consumers. Similarly, a central board would
post “prices” in response to the demand by industrial boards for the various factors
of production. A system of this type, Schumpeter states, would work perfectly
well—in theory as well as in practice.
It is clear that Schumpeter’s model of the socialist economy differs from
the way that the socialist economies of the Soviet Union and East-Central
Europe operated. The latter failed to produce efficient prices and were plagued
by constant political interference in the economy, by corruption among the
managers and by general inefficiency in the labor force. One is tempted to
pose the question as to whether Schumpeter’s model of the socialist economy
would have worked more efficiently than the economies of the socialist states,
could it ever have been implemented. A question of this type is, of course,
impossible to answer. Since Schumpeter, however, does not even discuss a
number of difficulties that are likely to beset his system—such as the failure
of the central board to come up with correct prices and of the state-run shops
to regulate their prices in response to consumer demand—one is justified in
rejecting his proposal as utopian and naïve.
Introduction xix
Finally, one part of Schumpeter’s book that is as much to the point today as
when it was originally written, is the section on democracy (Part IV). This is
where Schumpeter makes his famous distinction (borrowed from Weber) between,
on the one hand, democracy as a supreme value in itself (“the Classical Doctrine
of Democracy”), and, on the other hand, democracy as a method for the selection
of leaders (“Democracy as Competition for Political Leadership”). While the
former approach views democracy as a metaphysical value to be realized (“the
Will of the People”), the latter sees it as a way for the citizenry to select its leaders.
What is especially valuable with Schumpeter’s discussion of democracy as a
value in itself, is the firmness with which he attacks various illusions, such as
the notion that the only task of the politician is to carry out the alleged will of
“the people”. For one thing, as Schumpeter makes clear, politicians have their
own distinct interests, and these must be borne in mind in order to get a realistic
picture of the way a democracy works. And, for another, the majority does not
represent “the people”—only the majority.
Through his splendid discussion of democracy, Schumpeter joins the small
number of thinkers who have made seminal contributions to its theory. Granted
this, the question must nonetheless be raised if Schumpeter does not overdo his
attack on “the Classical Doctrine of Democracy”, and end up with far too negative,
not to say cynical, a view of democracy. He may well have been right to emphasize
democracy as a means for the selection of leaders—but can it not simultaneously
be recognized as a value in itself? Indeed, the more strongly democracy is valued
in a population, the more eager, (one would presume), people would be to
challenge the hierarchical and authoritarian kind of democracy that Schumpeter
(again following Weber) had in mind. One also wonders how much Schumpeter’s
attacks on “the Classical Doctrine of Democracy” had to do with his ill-concealed
contempt for the masses. Is it, for example, true that the typical citizen “becomes
a primitive again” as soon as “he enters the political field”?25
Schumpeter’s analysis of democracy deserves a more thorough discussion
than is possible here. Our final judgment of Schumpeter’s book, is that it always
inspires discussion, whether one agrees or disagrees with the author’s point of
view. Schumpeter’s main ambition in writing Capitalism, Socialism and
Democracy, he says, was to shake up the reader and make him or her think.
“We resent a call to thinking and hate unfamiliar argument that does not tally
with what we already believe or would like to believe”, Schumpeter wrote in
the preface to the second edition. “Now this is precisely where I wanted to serve
the reader. I did want to make him think”.26

PROLOGUE
M OST of the creations of the intellect or fancy pass away for good after
a time that varies between an after-dinner hour and a generation.
Some, however, do not. They suffer eclipses but they come back again, and
they come back not as unrecognizable elements of a cultural inheritance, but
in their individual garb and with their personal scars which people may see
and touch. These we may well call the great ones—it is no disadvantage of
this definition that it links greatness to vitality. Taken in this sense, this is
undoubtedly the word to apply to the message of Marx. But there is an
additional advantage to defining greatness by revivals: it thereby becomes
independent of our love or hate. We need not believe that a great
achievement must necessarily be a source of light or faultless in either
fundamental design or details. On the contrary, we may believe it to be a
power of darkness; we may think it fundamentally wrong or disagree with
it on any number of particular points. In the case of the Marxian system,
such adverse judgment or even exact disproof, by its very failure to injure
fatally, only serves to bring out the power of the structure.
The last twenty years have witnessed a most interesting Marxian revival.
That the great teacher of the socialist creed should have come into his own
in Soviet Russia is not surprising. And it is only characteristic of such
processes of canonization that there is, between the true meaning of Marx’s
message and bolshevist practice and ideology, at least as great a gulf as there
was between the religion of humble Galileans and the practice and ideology
of the princes of the church or the warlords of the Middle Ages.
But another revival is less easy to explain—the Marxian revival in the
United States. This phenomenon is so interesting because until the twenties
there was no Marxian strain of importance in either the American labor
movement or in the thought of the American intellectual. What Marxism
there was always had been superficial, insignificant and without standing.
Moreover, the bolshevist type of revival produced no similar spurt in those
countries which had previously been most steeped in Marxology. In
Germany notably, which of all countries had the strongest Marxian
tradition, a small orthodox sect indeed kept alive during the post-war
socialist boom as it had during the previous depression. But the leaders of
socialist thought (not only those allied to the Social Democratic party but
also those who went much beyond its cautious conservatism in practical
The Marxian Doctrine4
questions) betrayed little taste for reverting to the old tenets and, while
worshiping the deity, took good care to keep it at a distance and to reason
in economic matters exactly like other economists. Outside of Russia,
therefore, the American phenomenon stands alone. We are not concerned
with its causes. But it is worth while to survey the contours and the
meaning of the message so many Americans have made their own. 1
1 References to Marx’s writings will be confined to a minimum, and no data about his
life will be given. This seems unnecessary because any reader who wishes for a list of the
former and a general outline of the latter finds all he needs for our purposes in any dictionary,
but especially in the Encyclopedia Britannica or the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences.
A study of Marx begins most conveniently with the first volume of Das Kapital (first English
translation by S.Moore and E.Aveling, edited by F.Engels, 1886). In spite of a huge amount
of more recent work, I still think that F.Mehring’s biography is the best, at least from the
standpoint of the general reader.

CHAPTER I
MARX THE PROPHET
I T WAS not by a slip that an analogy from the world of religion was
permitted to intrude into the title of this chapter. There is more than analogy.
In one important sense, Marxism is a religion. To the believer it presents, first,
a system of ultimate ends that embody the meaning of life and are absolute
standards by which to judge events and actions; and, secondly, a guide to those
ends which implies a plan of salvation and the indication of the evil from
which mankind, or a chosen section of mankind, is to be saved. We may
specify still further: Marxist socialism also belongs to that subgroup which
promises paradise on this side of the grave. I believe that a formulation of these
characteristics by an hierologist would give opportunities for classification and
comment which might possibly lead much deeper into the sociological essence
of Marxism than anything a mere economist can say.
The least important point about this is that it explains the success of
Marxism. 1 Purely scientific achievement, had it even been much more perfect
than it was in the case of Marx, would never have won the immortality in the
historical sense which is his. Nor would his arsenal of party slogans have done
it. Part of his success, although a very minor part, is indeed attributable to the
barrelful of white-hot phrases, of impassioned accusations and wrathful
gesticulations, ready for use on any platform, that he put at the disposal of his
flock. All that needs to be said about this aspect of the matter is that this
ammunition has served and is serving its purpose very well, but that the
production of it carried a disadvantage: in order to forge such weapons for the
arena of social strife Marx had occasionally to bend, or to deviate from, the
opinions that would logically follow from his system. However, if Marx had
not been more than a purveyor of phraseology, he would be dead by now.
Mankind is not grateful for that sort of service and forgets quickly the names
of the people who write the librettos for its political operas.
But he was a prophet, and in order to understand the nature of this
achievement we must visualize it in the setting of his own time. It was the
zenith of bourgeois realization and the nadir of bourgeois civilization, the
time of mechanistic materialism, of a cultural milieu which had as yet
1 The religious quality of Marxism also explains a characteristic attitude of the orthodox
Marxist toward opponents. To him, as to any believer in a Faith, the opponent is not merely in
error but in sin. Dissent is disapproved of not only intellectually but also morally. There cannot
be any excuse for it once the Message has been revealed.
The Marxian Doctrine6
betrayed no sign that a new art and a new mode of life were in its womb,
and which rioted in most repulsive banality. Faith in any real sense was
rapidly falling away from all classes of society, and with it the only ray of
light (apart from what may have been derived from Rochdale attitudes and
saving banks) died from the workman’s world, while intellectuals professed
themselves highly satisfied with Mill’s Logic and the Poor Law.
Now, to millions of human hearts the Marxian message of the terrestrial
paradise of socialism meant a new ray of light and a new meaning of life.
Call Marxist religion a counterfeit if you like, or a caricature of faith—there
is plenty to be said for this view—but do not overlook or fail to admire the
greatness of the achievement. Never mind that nearly all of those millions
were unable to understand and appreciate the message in its true significance.
That is the fate of all messages. The important thing is that the message was
framed and conveyed in such a way as to be acceptable to the positivistic
mind of its time—which was essentially bourgeois no doubt, but there is no
paradox in saying that Marxism is essentially a product of the bourgeois
mind. This was done, on the one hand, by formulating with unsurpassed
force that feeling of being thwarted and ill treated which is the auto-
therapeutic attitude of the unsuccessful many, and, on the other hand, by
proclaiming that socialistic deliverance from those ills was a certainty
amenable to rational proof.
Observe how supreme art here succeeds in weaving together those extra-
rational cravings which receding religion had left running about like
masterless dogs, and the rationalistic and materialistic tendencies of the time,
ineluctable for the moment, which would not tolerate any creed that had no
scientific or pseudo-scientific connotation. Preaching the goal would have
been ineffectual; analyzing a social process would have interested only a few
hundred specialists. But preaching in the garb of analysis and analyzing with
a view to heartfelt needs, this is what conquered passionate allegiance and
gave to the Marxist that supreme boon which consists in the conviction that
what one is and stands for can never be defeated but must conquer
victoriously in the end. This, of course, does not exhaust the achievement.
Personal force and the flash of prophecy work independently of the contents
of the creed. No new life and no new meaning of life can be effectively
revealed without. But this does not concern us here.
Something will have to be said about the cogency and correctness of
Marx’s attempt to prove the inevitability of the socialist goal. One remark,
however, suffices as to what has been called above his formulation of the
feelings of the unsuccessful many. It was, of course, not a true formulation
of actual feelings, conscious or subconscious. Rather we could call it an
attempt at replacing actual feelings by a true or false revelation of the logic
Marx the Prophet 7
of social evolution. By doing this and by at tributing—quite unrealistically—
to the masses his own shibboleth of “class consciousness,” he undoubtedly
falsified the true psychology of the workman (which centers in the wish to
become a small bourgeois and to be helped to that status by political force),
but in so far as his teaching took effect he also expanded and ennobled it.
He did not weep any sentimental tears about the beauty of the socialist idea.
This is one of his claims to superiority over what he called the Utopian
Socialists. Nor did he glorify the workmen into heroes of daily toil as
bourgeois love to do when trembling for their dividends. He was perfectly
free from any tendency, so conspicuous in some of his weaker followers,
toward licking the workman’s boots. He had probably a clear perception of
what the masses are and he looked far above their heads toward social goals
altogether beyond what they thought or wanted. Also, he never taught any
ideals as set by himself. Such vanity was quite foreign to him. As every true
prophet styles himself the humble mouthpiece of his deity, so Marx
pretended no more than to speak the logic of the dialectic process of history.
There is dignity in all this which compensates for many pettinesses and
vulgarities with which, in his work and in his life, this dignity formed so
strange an alliance.
Another point, finally, should not go unmentioned. Marx was personally
much too civilized to fall in with those vulgar professors of socialism who do
not recognize a temple when they see it. He was perfectly able to understand
a civilization and the “relatively absolute” value of its values, however far
removed from it he may have felt himself to be. In this respect no better
testimony to his broad-mindedness can be offered than the Communist
Manifesto which is an account nothing short of glowing 2 of the achievements
of capitalism; and even in pronouncing pro futuro death sentence on it, he
never failed to recognize its historical necessity. This attitude, of course,
implies quite a lot of things Marx himself would have been unwilling to accept.
But he was undoubtedly strengthened in it, and it was made more easy for him
to take, because of that perception of the organic logic of things to which his
2 This may seem to be an exaggeration. But let us quote from the authorized English
translation: “The bourgeoisie…has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about.
It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts and Gothic
cathedrals…. The bourgeoisie… draws all nations…into civilization…. It has created enormous
cities… and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic!] of rural
life…. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive
and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together.” Observe that
all the achievements referred to are attributed to the bourgeoisie alone which is more than many
thoroughly bourgeois economists would claim. This is all I meant by the above passage—and
strikingly different from the views of the vulgarized Marxism of today or from the Veblenite
stuff of the modern non-Marxist radical. Let me say at once: not more than that is implied in
anything I shall say in the second part about the performance of capitalism.
The Marxian Doctrine8
theory of history gives one particular expression. Things social fell into order
for him, and however much of a coffeehouse conspirator he may have been
at some junctures of his life, his true self despised that sort of thing. Socialism
for him was no obsession which blots out all other colors of life and creates
an unhealthy and stupid hatred or contempt for other civilizations. And there
is, in more senses than one, justification for the title claimed for his type of
socialist thought and of socialist volition which are welded together by virtue
of his fundamental position: Scientific Socialism.

CHAPTER II
MARX THE SOCIOLOGIST
WE HAVE now to do a thing which is very objectionable to the faithful.
They naturally resent any application of cold analysis to what for them
is the very fountain of truth. But one of the things they resent most is cutting
Marx’s work into pieces and discussing them one by one. They would say
that the very act displays the incapacity of the bourgeois to grasp the
resplendent whole, all parts of which complement and explain one another,
so that the true meaning is missed as soon as any one part or aspect is
considered by itself. We have no choice, however. By committing the offense
and next taking up Marx the sociologist after Marx the prophet, I do not
mean to deny either the presence of a unity of social vision which succeeds
in giving some measure of analytic unity, and still more a semblance of unity,
to the Marxian work, or the fact that every part of it, however independent
intrinsically, has been correlated by the author with every other. Enough
independence remains nevertheless in every province of the vast realm to
make it possible for the student to accept the fruits of his labors in one of
them while rejecting those in another. Much of the glamour of the faith is
lost in the process but something is gained by salvaging important and
stimulating truth which is much more valuable by itself than it would be if
tied to hopeless wreckage.
This applies first of all to Marx’s philosophy which we may as well get out
of our way once and for all. German-trained and speculative-minded as he was,
he had a thorough grounding and a passionate interest in philosophy. Pure
philosophy of the German kind was his starting point and the love of his youth.
For a time he thought of it as his true vocation. He was a Neo-Hegelian, which
roughly means that while accepting the master’s fundamental attitudes and
methods he and his group eliminated, and replaced by pretty much their
opposites, the conservative interpretations put upon Hegel’s philosophy by
many of its other adherents. This background shows in all his writings
wherever the opportunity offers itself. It is no wonder that his German and
Russian readers, by bent of mind and training similarly disposed, should seize
primarily upon this element and make it the master key to the system.
I believe this to be a mistake and an injustice to Marx’s scientific powers.
He retained his early love during the whole of his lifetime. He enjoyed
certain formal analogies which may be found between his and Hegel’s
The Marxian Doctrine10
argument. He liked to testify to his Hegelianism and to use Hegelian
phraseology. But this is all. Nowhere did he betray positive science to
metaphysics. He says himself as much in the preface to the second edition
of the first volume of Das Kapital, and that what he says there is true and
no self-delusion can be proved by analyzing his argument, which everywhere
rests upon social fact, and the true sources of his propositions none of which
lies in the domain of philosophy. Of course, those commentators or critics
who themselves started from the philosophic side were unable to do this
because they did not know enough about the social sciences involved. The
propensity of the philosophic system-builder, moreover, made them averse
to any other interpretation but the one which proceeds from some
philosophic principle. So they saw philosophy in the most matter-of-fact
statements about economic experience, thereby shunting discussion on to the
wrong track, misleading friends and foes alike.
Marx the sociologist brought to bear on his task an equipment which
consisted primarily of an extensive command over historical and
contemporaneous fact. His knowledge of the latter was always somewhat
antiquated, for he was the most bookish of men and therefore fundamental
materials, as distinguished from the material of the newspapers, always reached
him with a lag. But hardly any historical work of his time that was of any
general importance or scope escaped him, although much of the monographic
literature did. While we cannot extol the completeness of his information in
this field as much as we shall his erudition in the field of economic theory, he
was yet able to illustrate his social visions not only by large historical frescoes
but also by many details most of which were as regards reliability rather above
than below the standards of other sociologists of his time. These facts he
embraced with a glance that pierced through the random irregularities of the
surface down to the grandiose logic of things historical. In this there was not
merely passion. There was not merely analytic impulse. There were both. And
the outcome of his attempt to formulate that logic, the so-called Economic
Interpretation of History, 1 is doubtless one of the greatest individual
achievements of sociology to this day. Before it, the question sinks into
insignificance whether or not this achievement was entirely original and how
far credit has in part to be given to predecessors, German and French.
The economic interpretation of history does not mean that men are,
consciously or unconsciously, wholly or primarily, actuated by economic
motives. On the contrary, the explanation of the role and mechanism of non-
economic motives and the analysis of the way in which social reality mirrors
1 First published in that scathing attack on Proudhon’s Philosophie de la Misère, entitled
Das Elend der Philosophie, 1847. Another version was included in the Communist
Manifesto, 1848.
Marx the Sociologist 11
itself in the individual psyches is an essential element of the theory and one
of its most significant contributions. Marx did not hold that religions,
metaphysics, schools of art, ethical ideas and political volitions were either
reducible to economic motives or of no importance. He only tried to unveil
the economic conditions which shape them and which account for their rise
and fall. The whole of Max Weber’s 2 facts and arguments fits perfectly into
Marx’s system. Social groups and classes and the ways in which these
groups or classes explain to themselves their own existence, location and
behavior were of course what interested him most. He poured the vials of
his most bilious wrath on the historians who took those attitudes and their
verbalizations (the ideologies or, as Pareto would have said, derivations) at
their face value and who tried to interpret social reality by means of them.
But if ideas or values were not for him the prime movers of the social
process, neither were they mere smoke. If I may use the analogy, they had
in the social engine the role of transmission belts. We cannot touch upon that
most interesting post-war development of these principles which would
afford the best instance by which to explain this, the Sociology of
Knowledge. 3 But it was necessary to say this much because Marx has been
persistently misunderstood in this respect. Even his friend Engels, at the open
grave of Marx, defined the theory in question as meaning precisely that
individuals and groups are swayed primarily by economic motives, which
in some important respects is wrong and for the rest piteously trivial.
While we are about it, we may as well defend Marx against another
misunderstanding: the economic interpretation of history has often been
called the materialistic interpretation. It has been called so by Marx himself.
This phrase greatly increased its popularity with some, and its unpopularity
with other people. But it is entirely meaningless. Marx’s philosophy is no
more materialistic than is Hegel’s, and his theory of history is not more
materialistic than is any other attempt to account for the historic process by
the means at the command of empirical science. It should be clear that this
is logically compatible with any metaphysical or religious belief—exactly as
any physical picture of the world is. Medieval theology itself supplies
methods by which it is possible to establish this compatibility.4
What the theory really says may be put into two propositions: (1)
2 The above refers to Weber’s investigations into the sociology of religions and particularly
to his famous study. Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus, republished in
his collected works.
3 The German word is Wissenssoziologie, and the best names to mention are those of Max
Scheler and Karl Mannheim. The latter’s article on the subject in the German Dictionary of
Sociology (Handwörterbuch der Soziologie) can serve as an introduction.
The Marxian Doctrine12
The forms or conditions of production are the fundamental determinant of
social structures which in turn breed attitudes, actions and civilizations. Marx
illustrates his meaning by the famous statement that the “hand-mill” creates
feudal, and the “steam-mill,” capitalist societies. This stresses the
technological element to a dangerous extent, but may be accepted on the
understanding that mere technology is not all of it. Popularizing a little and
recognizing that by doing so we lose much of the meaning, we may say that
it is our daily work which forms our minds, and that it is our location within
the productive process which determines our outlook on things—or the sides
of things we see—and the social elbowroom at the command of each of us.
(2) The forms of production themselves have a logic of their own; that is to
say, they change according to necessities inherent in them so as to produce
their successors merely by their own working. To illustrate by the same
Marxian example: the system characterized by the “hand-mill” creates an
economic and social situation in which the adoption of the mechanical
method of milling becomes a practical necessity that individuals or groups
are powerless to alter. The rise and working of the “steam-mill” in turn
creates new social functions and locations, new groups and views, which
develop and interact in such a way as to outgrow their own frame. Here,
then, we have the propeller which is responsible first of all for economic and,
in consequence of this, for any other social change, a propeller the action
of which does not itself require any impetus external to it.
Both propositions undoubtedly contain a large amount of truth and are,
as we shall find at several turns of our way, invaluable working hypotheses.
Most of the current objections completely fail, all those for instance which
in refutation point to the influence of ethical or religious factors, or the one
already raised by Eduard Bernstein, which with delightful simplicity asserts
that “men have heads” and can hence act as they choose. After what has been
said above, it is hardly necessary to dwell on the weakness of such
arguments: of course men “choose” their course of action which is not
directly enforced by the objective data of the environment; but they choose
from standpoints, views and propensities that do not form another set of
independent data but are themselves molded by the objective set.
Nevertheless, the question arises whether the economic interpretation of
history is more than a convenient approximation which must be expected to
work less satisfactorily in some cases than it does in others. An obvious
qualification occurs at the outset. Social structures, types and attitudes are
coins that do not readily melt. Once they are formed they persist, possibly
for centuries, and since different structures and types display different
degrees of this ability to survive, we almost always find that actual group
and national behavior more or less departs from what we should expect it
Marx the Sociologist 13
to be if we tried to infer it from the dominant forms of the productive
process. Though this applies quite generally, it is most clearly seen when a
highly durable structure transfers itself bodily from one country to another.
The social situation created in Sicily by the Norman conquest will illustrate
my meaning. Such facts Marx did not overlook but he hardly realized all
their implications.
A related case is of more ominous significance. Consider the emergence
of the feudal type of landlordism in the kingdom of the Franks during the
sixth and seventh centuries. This was certainly a most important event that
shaped the structure of society for many ages and also influenced conditions
of production, wants and technology included. But its simplest explanation
is to be found in the function of military leadership previously filled by the
families and individuals who (retaining that function however) became feudal
landlords after the definitive conquest of the new territory. This does not fit
the Marxian schema at all well and could easily be so construed as to point
in a different direction. Facts of this nature can no doubt also be brought into
the fold by means of auxiliary hypotheses but the necessity of inserting such
hypotheses is usually the beginning of the end of a theory.
Many other difficulties that arise in the course of attempts at historical
interpretation by means of the Marxian schema could be met by admitting
some measure of interaction between the sphere of production and other
spheres of social life. 5 But the glamour of fundamental truth that surrounds
it depends precisely on the strictness and simplicity of the one-way relation
which it asserts. If this be called in question, the economic interpretation of
history will have to take its place among other propositions of a similar
kind—as one of many partial truths—or else to give way to another that does
tell more fundamental truth. However, neither its rank as an achievement nor
its handiness as a working hypothesis is impaired thereby.
To the faithful, of course, it is simply the master key to all the secrets of
human history. And if we sometimes feel inclined to smile at rather naïve
applications of it, we should remember what sort of arguments it replaced.
Even the crippled sister of the economic interpretation of history, the
Marxian Theory of Social Classes, moves into a more favorable light as soon
as we bear this in mind.
Again, it is in the first place an important contribution that we have to
record. Economists have been strangely slow in recognizing the phenomenon
of social classes. Of course they always classified the agents whose interplay
produced the processes they dealt with. But these classes were simply sets
of individuals that displayed some common character: thus, some people
5 In his later life, Engels admitted that freely. Plekhanov went still further in this
direction.
The Marxian Doctrine14
were classed as landlords or workmen because they owned land or sold the
services of their labor. Social classes, however, are not the creatures of the
classifying observer but live entities that exist as such. And their existence
entails consequences that are entirely missed by a schema which looks upon
society as if it were an amorphous assemblage of individuals or families. It is
fairly open to question precisely how important the phenomenon of social
classes is for research in the field of purely economic theory. That it is very
important for many practical applications and for all the broader aspects of the
social process in general is beyond doubt.
Roughly speaking, we may say that the social classes made their entrance
in the famous statement contained in the Communist Manifesto that the history
of society is the history of class struggles. Of course, this is to put the claim
at its highest. But even if we tone it down to the proposition that historical
events may often be interpreted in terms of class interests and class attitudes
and that existing class structures are always an important factor in historical
interpretation, enough remains to entitle us to speak of a conception nearly as
valuable as was the-economic interpretation of history itself.
Clearly, success on the line of advance opened up by the principle of class
struggle depends upon the validity of the particular theory of classes we
make our own. Our picture of history and all our interpretations of cultural
patterns and the mechanism of social change will differ according to whether
we choose, for instance, the racial theory of classes and like Gobineau reduce
human history to the history of the struggle of races or, say, the division of
labor theory of classes in the fashion of Schmoller or of Durkheim and
resolve class antagonisms into antagonisms between the interests of
vocational groups. Nor is the range of possible differences in analysis
confined to the problem of the nature of classes. Whatever view we may hold
about it, different interpretations will result from different definitions of class
interest 6 and from different opinions about how class action manifests itself.
The subject is a hot-bed of prejudice to this day, and as yet hardly in its
scientific stage.
Curiously enough, Marx has never, as far as we know, worked out
systematically what it is plain was one of the pivots of his thought. It is
possible that he deferred the task until it was too late, precisely because his
thinking ran so much in terms of class concepts that he did not feel it
necessary to bother about definitive statement at all. It is equally possible
6 The reader will perceive that one’s views about what classes are and about what calls them
into existence do not uniquely determine what the interests of those classes are and how each
class will act on what “it”—its leaders for instance or the rank and file—considers or feels, in
the long run or in the short, erroneously or correctly, to be its interest or interests. The problem
of group interest is full of thorns and pitfalls of its own, quite irrespective of the nature of the
groups under study.
Marx the Sociologist 15
that some points about it remained unsettled in his own mind, and that his
way toward a full-fledged theory of classes was barred by certain difficulties
he had created for himself by insisting on a purely economic and over-
simplified conception of the phenomenon. He himself and his disciples both
offered applications of this under-developed theory to particular patterns of
which his own History of the Class Struggles in France is the outstanding
example. 7 Beyond that no real progress has been achieved. The theory of his
chief associate, Engels, was of the division of labor type and essentially un-
Marxian in its implications. Barring this we have only the sidelights and
aperçus—some of them of striking force and brilliance—that are strewn all
over the writings of the master, particularly in Das Kapital and the
Communist Manifesto.
The task of piecing together such fragments is delicate and cannot be
attempted here. The basic idea is clear enough, however. The stratifying
principle consists in the ownership, or the exclusion from ownership, of
means of production such as factory buildings, machinery, raw materials and
the consumers’ goods that enter into the workman’s budget. We have thus,
fundamentally, two and only two classes, those owners, the capitalists, and
those have-nots who are compelled to sell their labor, the laboring class or
proletariat. The existence of intermediate groups, such as are formed by
farmers or artisans who employ labor but also do manual work, by clerks
and by the professions is of course not denied; but they are treated as
anomalies which tend to disappear in the course of the capitalist process. The
two fundamental classes are, by virtue of the logic of their position and quite
independently of any individual volition, essentially antagonistic to each
other. Rifts within each class and collisions between subgroups occur and
may even have historically decisive importance. But in the last analysis, such
rifts or collisions are incidental. The one antagonism that is not incidental
but inherent in the basic design of capitalist society is founded upon the
private control over the means to produce: the very nature of the relation
between the capitalist class and the proletariat is strife—class war.
As we shall see presently, Marx tries to show how in that class war
capitalists destroy each other and eventually will destroy the capitalist system
too. He also tries to show how the ownership of capital leads to further
accumulation. But this way of arguing as well as the very definition that makes
the ownership of something the constituent characteristic of a social class only
serves to increase the importance of the question of “primitive accumulation,”
7 Another example is the socialist theory of imperialism which will be noticed later on.
O.Bauer’s interesting attempt to interpret the antagonisms between the various races that
inhabited the Austro-Hungarian Empire in terms of the class struggle between capitalists and
workers (Die Nationalitätenfrage, 1905) also deserves to be mentioned, although the skill of
the analyst only serves to show up the inadequacy of the tool.
The Marxian Doctrine16
that is to say, of the question how capitalists came to be capitalists in the first
instance or how they acquired that stock of goods which according to the
Marxian doctrine was necessary in order to enable them to start exploiting. On
this question Marx is much less explicit. 8 He contemptuously rejects the
bourgeois nursery tale (Kinderfibel) that some people rather than others
became, and are still becoming every day, capitalists by superior intelligence
and energy in working and saving. Now he was well advised to sneer at that
story about the good boys. For to call for a guffaw is no doubt an excellent
method of disposing of an uncomfortable truth, as every politician knows to
his profit. Nobody who looks at historical and contemporaneous fact with
anything like an unbiased mind can fail to observe that this children’s tale,
while far from telling the whole truth, yet tells a good deal of it. Supernormal
intelligence and energy account for industrial success and in particular for the
founding of industrial positions in nine cases out of ten. And precisely in the
initial stages of capitalism and of every individual industrial career, saving was
and is an important element in the process though not quite as explained in
classic economics. It is true that one does not ordinarily attain the status of
capitalist (industrial employer) by saving from a wage or salary in order to
equip one’s factory by means of the fund thus assembled. The bulk of
accumulation comes from profits and hence presupposes profits—this is in fact
the sound reason for distinguishing saving from accumulating. The means
required in order to start enterprise are typically provided by borrowing other
people’s savings, the presence of which in many small puddles is easy to
explain or the deposits which banks create for the use of the would-be
entrepreneur. Nevertheless, the latter does save as a rule: the function of his
saving is to raise him above the necessity of submitting to daily drudgery for
the sake of his daily bread and to give him breathing space in order to look
around, to develop his plans and to secure cooperation. As a matter of
economic theory, therefore, Marx had a real case—though he overstated it—
when he denied to saving the role that the classical authors attributed to it.
Only his inference does not follow. And the guffaw is hardly more justified
than it would be if the classical theory were correct.9
The guffaw did its work, however, and helped to clear the road for Marx’s
alternative theory of primitive accumulation. But this alternative theory is not
8 See Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xxvi: “The Secret of Primitive Accumulation.”
9 I will not stay to stress, though I must mention, that even the classical theory is not as
wrong as Marx pretended it was. “Saving up” in the most literal sense has been, especially in
earlier stages of capitalism, a not unimportant method of “original accumulation.” Moreover,
there was another method that was akin to it though not identical with Many a factory in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was just a shed that a man was able to put up by the work
of his hands, and required only the simplest equipment to work it. In such cases the manual
work of the prospective capitalist plus a quite small fund of savings was all that was needed—
and brains, of course.
Marx the Sociologist 17
as definite as we might wish. Force—robbery—subjugation of the masses
facilitating their spoliation and the results of the pillage in turn facilitating
subjugation—this was all right of course and admirably tallied with ideas
common among intellectuals of all types, in our day still more than in the
day of Marx. But evidently it does not solve the problem, which is to explain
how some people acquired the power to subjugate and to rob. Popular
literature does not worry about it. I should not think of addressing the
question to the writings of John Reed. But we are dealing with Marx.
Now at least the semblance of a solution is afforded by the historical
quality of all the major theories of Marx. For him, it is essential for the logic
of capitalism, and not only a matter of fact, that it grew out of a feudal state
of society. Of course the same question about the causes and the mechanism
of social stratification arises also in this case, but Marx substantially accepted
the bourgeois view that feudalism was a reign of force 10 in which subjugation
and exploitation of the masses were already accomplished facts. The class
theory devised primarily for the conditions of capitalist society was extended
to its feudal predecessor—as was much of the conceptual apparatus of the
economic theory of capitalism 11 —and some of the most thorny problems
were stowed away in the feudal compound to reappear in a settled state, in
the form of data, in the analysis of the capitalist pattern. The feudal exploiter
was simply replaced by the capitalist exploiter. In those cases in which feudal
lords actually turned into industrialists, this alone would solve what is thus
left of the problem. Historical evidence lends a certain amount of support
to this view: many feudal lords, particularly in Germany, in fact did erect
and run factories, often providing the financial means from their feudal rents
and the labor from the agricultural population (not necessarily but sometimes
their serfs). 12 In all other cases the material available to stop the gap is
distinctly inferior. The only frank way of expressing the situation is that from
a Marxian standpoint there is no satisfactory explanation, that is to say, no
explanation without resorting to non-Marxian elements suggestive of non-
Marxian conclusions. 13
10 Many socialist writers besides Marx have displayed that uncritical confidence in the
explanatory value of the element of force and of the control over the physical means with which
to exert force. Ferdinand Lassalle, for instance, has little beyond cannons and bayonets to offer
by way of explanation of governmental authority. It is a source of wonder to me that so many
people should be blind to the weakness of such a sociology and to the fact that it would
obviously be much truer to say that power leads to control over cannons (and men willing to
use them) than that control over cannons generates power.
11 This constitutes one of the affinities of the teaching of Marx to that of K.
Rodbertus.
12 W.Sombart, in the first edition of his Theorie des modernen Kapitalismus, tried to
make the most of those cases. But the attempt to base primitive accumu lation entirely
on the accumulation of ground rent showed its hopelessness as Sombart himself
eventually recognized.
The Marxian Doctrine18
This, however, vitiates the theory at both its historical and its logical
source. Since most of the methods of primitive accumulation also account
for later accumulation—primitive accumulation, as it were, continues
throughout the capitalist era—it is not possible to say that Marx’s theory of
social classes is all right except for the difficulties about processes in a distant
past. But it is perhaps superfluous to insist on the shortcomings of a theory
which not even in the most favorable instances goes anywhere near the heart
of the phenomenon it undertakes to explain, and which never should have
been taken seriously. These instances are to be found mainly in that epoch
of capitalist evolution which derived its character from the prevalence of the
medium-sized owner-managed firm. Beyond the range of that type, class
positions, though in most cases reflected in more or less corresponding
economic positions, are more often the cause than the consequence of the
latter: business achievement is obviously not everywhere the only avenue to
social eminence and only where it is can ownership of means of production
causally determine a group’s position in the social structure. Even then,
however, it is as reasonable to make that ownership the defining element as
it would be to define a soldier as a man who happens to have a gun. The
water-tight division between people who (together with their descendants)
are supposed to be capitalists once for all and others who (together with their
descendants) are supposed to be proletarians once for all is not only, as has
often been pointed out, utterly unrealistic but it misses the salient point about
social classes—the incessant rise and fall of individual families into and out
of the upper strata. The facts I am alluding to are all obvious and
indisputable. If they do not show on the Marxian canvas, the reason can only
be in their un-Marxian implications.
It is not superfluous, however, to consider the role which that theory plays
within Marx’s structure and to ask ourselves what analytic intention—as
distinguished from its use as a piece of equipment for the agitator—he meant
it to serve.
On the one hand, we must bear in mind that for Marx the theory of Social
Classes and the Economic Interpretation of History were not what they are
for us, viz., two independent doctrines. With Marx, the former implements
the latter in a particular way and thus restricts—makes more definite—the
modus operandi of the conditions or forms of production. These determine
the social structure and, through the social structure, all manifestations of
13 This holds true even if we admit robbery to the utmost extent to which it is possible to
do so without trespassing upon the sphere of the intellectual’s folklore. Robbery actually entered
into the building up of commercial capital at many times and places. Phoenician as well as
English wealth offers familiar examples. But even then the Marxian explanation is inadequate
because in the last resort successful robbery must rest on the personal superiority of the robbers.
And as soon as this is admitted, a very different theory of social stratification suggests itself.
Marx the Sociologist 19
civilization and the whole march of cultural and political history. But the
social structure is, for all non-socialist epochs, defined in terms of classes—
those two classes—which are the true dramatis personae and at the same time
the only immediate creatures of the logic of the capitalist system of
production which affects everything else through them. This explains why
Marx was forced to make his classes purely economic phenomena, and even
phenomena that were economic in a very narrow sense: he thereby cut
himself off from a deeper view of them, but in the precise spot of his analytic
schema in which he placed them he had no choice but to do so.
On the other hand, Marx wished to define capitalism by the same trait
that also defines his class division. A little reflection will convince the
reader that this is not a necessary or natural thing to do. In fact it was a
bold stroke of analytic strategy which linked the fate of the class
phenomenon with the fate of capitalism in such a way that socialism,
which in reality has nothing to do with the presence or absence of social
classes, became, by definition, the only possible kind of classless society,
excepting primitive groups. This ingenious tautology could not equally
well have been secured by any definitions of classes and of capitalism
other than those chosen by Marx—the definition by private ownership of
means of production. Hence there had to be just two classes, owners and
non-owners, and hence all other principles of division, much more
plausible ones among them, had to be severely neglected or discounted
or else reduced to that one.
The exaggeration of the definiteness and importance of the dividing line
between the capitalist class in that sense and the proletariat was surpassed
only by the exaggeration of the antagonism between them. To any mind not
warped by the habit of fingering the Marxian rosary it should be obvious
that their relation is, in normal times, primarily one of cooperation and that
any theory to the contrary must draw largely on pathological cases for
verification. In social life, antagonism and synagogism are of course both
ubiquitous and in fact inseparable except in the rarest of cases. But I am
almost tempted to say that there was, if anything, less of absolute nonsense
in the old harmonistic view—full of nonsense though that was too—than in
the Marxian construction of the impassable gulf between tool owners and
tool users. Again, however, he had no choice, not because he wanted to arrive
at revolutionary results—these he could have derived just as well from
dozens of other possible schemata—but because of the requirements of his
own analysis. If class struggle was the subject matter of history and also the
means of bringing about the socialist dawn, and if there had to be just those
two classes, then their relation had to be antagonistic on principle or else the
force in his system of social dynamics would have been lost.
The Marxian Doctrine20
Now, though Marx defines capitalism sociologically, i.e., by the institution
of private control over means of production, the mechanics of capitalist
society are provided by his economic theory. This economic theory is to
show how the sociological data embodied in such conceptions as class, class
interest, class behavior, exchange between classes, work out through the
medium of economic values, profits, wages, investment, etc., and how they
generate precisely the economic process that will eventually break its own
institutional framework and at the same time create the conditions for the
emergence of another social world. This particular theory of social classes
is the analytic tool which, by linking the economic interpretation of history
with the concepts of the profit economy, marshals all social facts, makes all
phenomena confocal. It is therefore not simply a theory of an individual
phenomenon which is to explain that phenomenon and nothing else. It has
an organic function which is really much more important to the Marxian
system than the measure of success with which it solves its immediate
problem. This function must be seen if we are to understand how an analyst
of the power of Marx could ever have borne with its shortcomings.
There are, and always have been, some enthusiasts who admired the
Marxian theory of social classes as such. But far more understandable are
the feelings of all those who admire the force and grandeur of that synthesis
as a whole to the point of being ready to condone almost any number of
shortcomings in the component parts. We shall try to appraise it for ourselves
(Chapter IV). But first we must see how Marx’s economic mechanics acquits
itself of the task that his general plan imposes upon it.
21
CHAPTER III
MARX THE ECONOMIST
AS AN economic theorist Marx was first of all a very learned man. It may
seem strange that I should think it necessary to give such prominence
to this element in the case of an author whom I have called a genius and a
prophet. Yet it is important to appreciate it. Geniuses and prophets do not
usually excel in professional learning, and their originality, if any, is often
due precisely to the fact that they do not. But nothing in Marx’s economics
can be accounted for by any want of scholarship or training in the technique
of theoretical analysis. He was a voracious reader and an indefatigable
worker. He missed very few contributions of significance. And whatever he
read he digested, wrestling with every fact or argument with a passion for
detail most unusual in one whose glance habitually encompassed entire
civilizations and secular developments. Criticizing and rejecting or accepting
and coordinating, he always went to the bottom of every matter. The
outstanding proof of this is in his work, Theories of Surplus Value, which is
a monument of theoretical ardor. This incessant endeavor to school himself
and to master whatever there was to master went some way toward freeing
him from prejudices and extra-scientific aims, though he certainly worked
in order to verify a definite vision. To his powerful intellect, the interest in
the problem as a problem was paramount in spite of himself; and however
much he may have bent the import of his final results, while at work he was
primarily concerned with sharpening the tools of analysis proffered by the
science of his day, with straightening out logical difficulties and with
building on the foundation thus acquired a theory that in nature and intent
was truly scientific whatever its shortcomings may have been.
It is easy to see why both friends and foes should have misunderstood the
nature of his performance in the purely economic field. For the friends, he was
so much more than a mere professional theorist that it would have seemed almost
blasphemy to them to give too much prominence to this aspect of his work. The
foes, who resented his attitudes and the setting of his theoretic argument, found
it almost impossible to admit that in some parts of his work he did precisely the
kind of thing which they valued so highly when presented by other hands.
Moreover, the cold metal of economic theory is in Marx’s pages immersed in
such a wealth of steaming phrases as to acquire a temperature not naturally its
own. Whoever shrugs his shoulders at Marx’s claim to be consideredan analyst
The Marxian Doctrine22
in the scientific sense thinks of course of those phrases and not of the thought,
of the impassioned language and of the glowing indictment of “exploitation” and
“immiserization” (this is probably the best way to render the word Verelendung,
which is no more good German than that English monster is good English. It is
immiserimento in Italian). To be sure, all these things and many others, such as
his spiteful innuendoes or his vulgar comment on Lady Orkney,1 are important
parts of the show, were important to Marx himself and are so both for the faithful
and for the unbelievers. They explain in part why many people insist on seeing
in Marx’s theorems something more than, and even something fundamentally
different from, the analogous propositions of his master. But they do not affect
the nature of his analysis.
Marx had a master then? Yes. Real understanding of his economics begins
with recognizing that, as a theorist, he was a pupil of Ricardo. He was his pupil
not only in the sense that his own argument evidently starts from Ricardo’s
propositions but also in the much more significant sense that he had learned the
art of theorizing from Ricardo. He always used Ricardo’s tools, and every
theoretical problem presented itself to him in the form of difficulties which
occurred to him in his profound study of Ricardo and of suggestions for further
work which he gleaned from it. Marx himself admitted much of this, although
of course he would not have admitted that his attitude toward Ricardo was
typically that of a pupil who goes to the professor, hears him speak several times
in almost successive sentences of redundancy of population and of population
that is redundant and again of machinery making population redundant, and then
goes home and tries to work the thing out. That both parties to the Marxian
controversy should have been averse to admitting this is perhaps understandable.
Ricardo’s is not the only influence which acted on Marx’s economics but
no other than that of Quesnay, from whom Marx derived his fundamental
conception of the economic process as a whole, need be mentioned in a sketch
like this. The group of English writers who between 1800 and 1840 tried to
develop the labor theory of value may have furnished many suggestions and
details, but this is covered for our purpose by the reference to the Ricardian
current of thought. Several authors, to some of whom Marx was unkind in
inverse proportion to their distance from him and whose work ran in many
points parallel to his (Sismondi, Rodbertus, John Stuart Mill), must be left out
of account, as must everything not directly pertaining to the main argument—
so, for instance, Marx’s distinctly weak performance in the field of money, in
which he did not succeed in coming up to the Ricardian standard.
Now for a desperately abbreviated outline of the Marxian argument,
unavoidably unjust on many counts to the structure of Das Kapital which,
1 The friend of William III—the king who, so unpopular in his own day, had by that time
become an idol of the English bourgeoisie.
Marx the Economist 23
partly unfinished, partly battered by successful attack, still stretches its
mighty skyline before us!
1. Marx fell in with the ordinary run of the theorists of his own and also
of a later epoch by making a theory of value the corner stone of his
theoretical structure. His theory of value is the Ricardian one. I believe that
such an outstanding authority as Professor Taussig disagreed with this and
always stressed the differences. There is plenty of difference in wording,
method of deduction and sociological implication, but there is none in the
bare theorem, which alone matters to the theorist of today. 2 Both Ricardo and
Marx say that the value of every commodity is (in perfect equilibrium and
perfect competition) proportional to the quantity of labor contained in the
commodity, provided this labor is in accordance with the existing standard
of efficiency of production (the “socially necessary quantity of labor”). Both
measure this quantity in hours of work and use the same method in order to
reduce different qualities of work to a single standard. Both encounter the
threshold difficulties incident to this approach similarly (that is to say, Marx
encounters them as he had learned to do from Ricardo). Neither has anything
useful to say about monopoly or what we now call imperfect competition.
Both answer critics by the same arguments. Marx’s arguments are merely
less polite, more prolix and more “philosophical” in the worst sense of this
word.
Everybody knows that this theory of value is unsatisfactory. In the
voluminous discussion that has been carried on about it, the right is not
indeed all on one side and many faulty arguments have been used by its
opponents. The essential point is not whether labor is the true “source” or
“cause” of economic value. This question may be of primary interest to
social philosophers who want to deduce from it ethical claims to the product,
and Marx himself was of course not indifferent to this aspect of the problem.
For economics as a positive science, however, which has to describe or
explain actual processes, it is much more important to ask how the labor
2 It may, however, be open to question whether this is all that mattered to Marx himself.
He was under the same delusion as Aristotle, viz., that value, though a factor in the
determination of relative prices, is yet something that is different from, and exists independently
of, relative prices or exchange relations. The proposition that the value of a commodity is the
amount of labor embodied in it can hardly mean anything else. If so, then there is a difference
between Ricardo and Marx, since Ricardo’s values are simply exchange values or relative prices.
It is worth while to mention this because, if we could accept this view of value, much of his
theory that seems to us untenable or even meaningless would cease to be so. Of course we
cannot. Nor would the situation be improved if, following some Marxologists, we took the view
that whether a distinct “substance” or not, Marx’s labor-quantity values are merely intended
to serve as tools by which to display the division of total social income into labor income and
capital income (the theory of individual relative prices being then a secondary matter). For, as
we shall see presently, Marx’s theory of value also fails at this task (granted that we can divorce
that task from the problem of individual prices).
The Marxian Doctrine24
theory of value works as a tool of analysis, and the real trouble with it is
that it does so very badly.
To begin with, it does not work at all outside of the case of perfect
competition. Second, even with perfect competition it never works
smoothly except if labor is the only factor of production and, moreover, if
labor is all of one kind. 3 If either of these two conditions is not fulfilled,
additional assumptions must be introduced and analytical difficulties
increase to an extent that soon becomes unmanageable. Reasoning on the
lines of the labor theory of value is hence reasoning on a very special case
without practical importance, though something might be said for it if it
be interpreted in the sense of a rough approximation to the historical
tendencies of relative values. The theory which replaced it—in its earliest
and now outmoded form, known as the theory of marginal utility—may
claim superiority on many counts but the real argument for it is that it is
much more general and applies equally well, on the one hand, to the cases
of monopoly and imperfect competition and, on the other hand, to the
presence of other factors and of labor of many different kinds and qualities.
Moreover, if we introduce into this theory the restrictive assumptions
mentioned, proper tionality between value and quantity of labor applied
follows from it. 4 It should be clear, therefore, not only that it was perfectly
absurd for Marxists to question, as at first they tried to do, the validity of
the marginal utility theory of value (which was what confronted them), but
3 The necessity for the second assumption is particularly damaging. The labor theory
of value may be able to deal with differences in quality of labor that are due to training
(acquired skill): appropriate quota of the work that goes into the process of training would
then have to be added to every hour of skilled work so that we might, without leaving the
range of the principle, put the hour of work done by a skilled workman equal to a
determined multiple of an hour of unskilled work. But this method fails in the case of
“natural” differences in quality of work due to differences in intelligence, will power,
physical strength or agility Then recourse must be had to the difference in value of the
hours respectively worked by the naturally inferior and the naturally superior workmen—
a value that is not itself explainable on the labor-quantity principle. In fact Ricardo does
precisely this: he simply says that those different qualities will somehow be put into their
right relation by the play of the market mechanism so that we may after all speak of an
hour’s work done by workman A being equivalent to a definite multiple of the work done
by workman B. But he completely overlooks that in arguing in this way he appeals to
another principle of valuation and really surrenders the labor-quantity principle which thus
fails from the start, within its own precincts, and before it has the chance to fail because
of the presence of factors other than labor.
4 In fact, it follows from the marginal utility theory of value that for equilibrium
to exist each factor must be so distributed over the productive uses open to it that the
last unit allocated to any use produces the same value as the last unit allocated to each
of the other uses. If there be no other factors except labor of one kind and quality, this
obviously means that the relative values or prices of all commodities must be
proportional to the numbers of man-hours contained in them, provided there is perfect
competition and mobility.
Marx the Economist 25
also that it is incorrect to call the labor theory of value “wrong.” In any
case it is dead and buried.
2. Though neither Ricardo nor Marx seems to have been fully aware of
all the weaknesses of the position in which they had placed themselves by
adopting this starting point, they perceived some of them quite clearly. In
particular, they both grappled with the problem of eliminating the element
of Services of Natural Agents which of course are deprived of their proper
place in the process of production and distribution by a theory of value that
rests upon quantity of labor alone. The familiar Ricardian theory of the rent
of land is essentially an attempt to accomplish that elimination and the
Marxian theory is another. As soon as we are in possession of an analytical
apparatus which takes care of rent as naturally as it does of wages, the whole
difficulty vanishes. Hence nothing more need be said about the intrinsic
merits or demerits of Marx’s doctrine of absolute as distinguished from
differential rent, or about its relation to that of Rodbertus.
But even if we let that pass we are still left with the difficulty arising out of
the presence of capital in the sense of a stock of means of production that are
themselves produced. To Ricardo it presented itself very simply: in the famous
Section IV of the first chapter of his Principles he introduces and accepts as a
fact, without attempting to question it, that, where capital goods such as plant,
machinery and raw materials are used in the production of a commodity, this
commodity will sell at a price which will yield a net return to the owner of those
capital goods. He realized that this fact has something to do with the period of
time that elapses between the investment and the emergence of salable products
and that it will enforce deviations of the actual values of these from
proportionality to the man-hours “contained” in them—including the man-hours
that went into the production of the capital goods themselves—whenever these
periods are not the same in all industries. To this he points as coolly as if it
followed from, instead of contradicting, his fundamental theorem about value,
and beyond this he does not really go, confining himself to some secondary
problems that arise in this connection and obviously believing that his theory
still describes the basic determinant of value.
Marx also introduced, accepted and discussed that same fact and never
questioned it as a fact. He also realized that it seems to give the lie to the
labor theory of value. But he recognized the inadequacy of Ricardo’s
treatment of the problem and, while accepting the problem itself in the shape
in which Ricardo presented it, set about to attack it in earnest, devoting to
it about as many hundreds of pages as Ricardo devoted sentences.
3. In doing so he not only displayed much keener perception of the nature
of the problem involved, but he also improved the conceptual apparatus he
received. For instance, he replaced to good purpose Ricardo’s distinction
The Marxian Doctrine26
between fixed and circulating capital by the distinction between constant and
variable (wage) capital, and Ricardo’s rudimentary notions about duration
of the processes of production by the much more rigorous concept of
“organic structure of capital” which turns on the relation between constant
and variable capital. He also made many other contributions to the theory
of capital. We will however confine ourselves now to his explanation of the
net return to capital, his Theory of Exploitation.
The masses have not always felt themselves to be frustrated and exploited.
But the intellectuals that formulated their views for them have always told
them that they were, without necessarily meaning by it anything precise.
Marx could not have done without the phrase even if he had wanted to. His
merit and achievement were that he perceived the weakness of the various
arguments by which the tutors of the mass mind before him had tried to show
how exploitation came about and which even today supply the stock in trade
of the ordinary radical. None of the usual slogans about bargaining power
and cheating satisfied him. What he wanted to prove was that exploitation
did not arise from individual situations occasionally and accidentally; but that
it resulted from the very logic of the capitalist system, unavoidably and quite
independently of any individual intention.
This is how he did it. The brain, muscles and nerves of a laborer
constitute, as it were, a fund or stock of potential labor (Arbeitskraft, usually
translated not very satisfactorily by labor power). This fund or stock Marx
looks upon as a sort of substance that exists in a definite quantity and in
capitalist society is a commodity like any other. We may clarify the thought
for ourselves by thinking of the case of slavery: Marx’s idea is that there is
no essential difference, though there are many secondary ones, between the
wage contract and the purchase of a slave—what the employer of “free”
labor buys is not indeed, as in the case of slavery, the laborers themselves
but a definite quota of the sum total of their potential labor.
Now since labor in that sense (not the labor service or the actual man-
hour) is a commodity the law of value must apply to it. That is to say, it must
in equilibrium and perfect competition fetch a wage proportional to the
number of labor hours that entered into its “production.” But what number
of labor hours enters into the “production” of the stock of potential labor
that is stored up within a workman’s skin? Well, the number of labor hours
it took and takes to rear, feed, clothe and house the laborer. 5 This constitutes
the value of that stock, and if he sells parts of it—expressed in days or weeks
or years—he will receive wages that correspond to the labor value of these
5 That is, barring the distinction between “labor power” and labor, the solution which
S.Bailey (A Critical Discourse on the Nature, Measure and Causes of Value, 1825) by
anticipation voted absurd, as Marx himself did not fail to notice (Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xix).
Marx the Economist 27
parts, just as a slave trader selling a slave would in equilibrium receive a
price proportional to the total number of those labor hours. It should be
observed once more that Marx thus keeps carefully clear of all those popular
slogans which in one form or another hold that in the capitalist labor market
the workman is robbed or cheated or that, in his lamentable weakness, he is
simply compelled to accept any terms imposed. The thing is not as simple
as this: he gets the full value of his labor potential.
But once the “capitalists” have acquired that stock of potential services they
are in a position to make the laborer work more hours—render more actual
services—than it takes to produce that stock or potential stock. They can exact,
in this sense, more actual hours of labor than they have paid for. Since the
resulting products also sell at a price proportional to the man-hours that enter
into their production, there is a difference between the two values—arising
from nothing but the modus operandi of the Marxian law of values—which
necessarily and by virtue of the mechanism of capitalist markets goes to the
capitalist. This is the Surplus Value (Mehrwert). 6 By appropriating it the
capitalist “exploits” labor, though he pays to the laborers not less than the full
value of their labor potential and receives from consumers not more than the
full value of the products he sells. Again it should be observed that there is
no appeal to such things as unfair pricing, restriction of production or cheating
in the markets for the products. Marx did of course not mean to deny the
existence of such practices. But he saw them in their true perspective and
hence never based any fundamental conclusions upon them.
Let us admire, in passing, the pedagogics of it: however special and removed
from its ordinary sense the meaning might be which the word Exploitation now
acquires, however doubtful the support which it derives from the Natural Law
and the philosophies of the schoolmen and the writers of the Enlightenment, it
is received into the pale of scientific argument after all and thus serves the
purpose of comforting the disciple marching on to fight his battles.
As regards the merits of this scientific argument we must carefully
distinguish two aspects of it, one of which has been persistently neglected
by critics. At the ordinary level of the theory of a stationary economic
process it is easy to show that under Marx’s own assumptions the doctrine
of surplus value is untenable. The labor theory of value, even if we could
grant it to be valid for every other commodity, can never be applied to the
commodity labor, for this would imply that workmen, like machines, are
being produced according to rational cost calculations. Since they are not,
there is no warrant for assuming that the value of labor power will be
proportional to the man-hours that enter into its “production.” Logically
6 The rate of surplus value (degree of exploitation) is defined as the ratio between surplus
value and the variable (wage) capital.
The Marxian Doctrine28
Marx would have improved his position had he accepted Lassalle’s Iron Law
of Wages or simply argued on Malthusian lines as Ricardo did. But since
he very wisely refused to do that, his theory of exploitation loses one of its
essential props from the start. 7
Moreover, it can be shown that perfectly competitive equilibrium
cannot exist in a situation in which all capitalist-employers make
exploitation gains. For in this case they would individually try to expand
production, and the mass effect of this would unavoidably tend to
increase wage rates and to reduce gains of that kind to zero. It would no
doubt be possible to mend the case somewhat by appealing to the theory
of imperfect competition, by introducing friction and institutional
inhibitions of the working of competition, by stressing all the possibilities
of hitches in the sphere of money and credit and so on. Only a moderate
case could be made out in this manner, however, one that Marx would
have heartily despised.
But there is another aspect of the matter. We need only look at Marx’s
analytic aim in order to realize that he need not have accepted battle on the
ground on which it is so easy to beat him. This is so easy only as long as
we see in the theory of surplus value nothing but a proposition about
stationary economic processes in perfect equilibrium. Since what he aimed
at analyzing was not a state of equilibrium which according to him capitalist
society can never attain, but on the contrary a process of incessant change
in the economic structure, criticism along the above lines is not completely
decisive. Surplus values may be impossible in perfect equilibrium but can
be ever present because that equilibrium is never allowed to establish itself.
They may always tend to vanish and yet be always there because they are
constantly recreated. This defense will not rescue the labor theory of value,
particularly as applied to the commodity labor itself, or the argument about
exploitation as it stands. But it will enable us to put a more favorable
interpretation on the result, although a satisfactory theory of those surpluses
will strip them of the specifically Marxian connotation. This aspect proves
to be of considerable importance. It throws a new light also on other parts
of Marx’s apparatus of economic analysis and goes far toward explaining
why that apparatus was not more fatally damaged by the successful criticisms
directed against its very fundaments.
4. If, however, we go on at the level on which discussion of Marxian
doctrines ordinarily moves, we get deeper and deeper into difficulties or
rather we perceive that the faithful do when they try to follow the master
on his way. To begin with, the doctrine of surplus value does not make it
7 We shall see later how Marx tried to replace that prop.
Marx the Economist 29
any easier to solve the problems, alluded to above, which are created by
the discrepancy between the labor theory of value and the plain facts of
economic reality. On the contrary it accentuates them because, according
to it, constant capital—that is, non-wage capital—does not transmit to the
product any more value than it loses in its production; only wage capital
does that and the profits earned should in consequence vary, as between
firms, according to the organic composition of their capitals. Marx relies
on the competition between capitalists for bringing about a redistribution
of the total “mass” of surplus value such that each firm should earn profits
proportional to its total capital, or that individual rates of profits should
be equalized. We readily see that the difficulty belongs to the class of
spurious problems that always result from attempts to work an unsound
theory, 8 and the solution to the class of counsels of despair. Marx, however,
believed not only that the latter availed to establish the emergence of
uniform rates of profits and to explain how, because of it, relative prices
of commodities will deviate from their values in terms of labor, 9 but also
that his theory offered an explanation of another “law” that held a great
place in classical doctrine, namely, the statement that the rate of profit has
an inherent tendency to fall. This follows in fact fairly plausibly from the
increase in relative importance of the constant part of the total capital in
the wage-good industries: if the relative importance of plant and equipment
increases in those industries, as it does in the course of capitalist evolution,
and if the rate of surplus value or the degree of exploitation remains the
8 There is, however, one element in it which is not unsound and the perception of which,
however dim, should be recorded to Marx’s credit. It is not, as almost all economists believe
even today, an unquestionable fact that produced means of production would yield a net return
in a perfectly stationary economy. It they in practice normally do seem to yield net returns,
that may well be due to the fact that the economy never is stationary. Marx’s argument about
the net return to capital might be interpreted as a devious way of recognizing this.
9 His solution of that problem he embodied in manuscripts from which his friend Engels
compiled the posthumous third volume of Das Kapital. Therefore we have not before us what
Marx himself might ultimately have wished to say. As it was, most critics felt no hesitation in
convicting him of having by the third volume flatly contradicted the doctrine of the first. On
the face of it that verdict is not justified. If we place ourselves on Marx’s standpoint, as it is
our duty in a question of this kind, it is not absurd to look upon surplus value as a “mass”
produced by the social process of production considered as a unit and to make the rest a matter
of the distribution of that mass. And if that is not absurd, it is still possible to hold that the
relative prices of commodities, as deduced in the third volume, follow from the labor-quantity
theory in the first volume. Hence it is not correct to assert, as some writers from Lexis to Cole
have done, that Marx’s theory of value is completely divorced from, and contributes nothing
to, his theory of prices. But Marx stands to gain little by being cleared of contradiction. The
remaining indictment is quite strong enough. The best contribution to the whole question of
how values and prices are related to each other in the Marxian system, that also refers to some
of the better performances in a controversy that was not exactly fascinating, is L.von
Bortkiewicz, “Wertrechnung und Preisrechnung im Marxschen System,” Archiv für
Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik, 1907.
The Marxian Doctrine30
same, then the rate of return to total capital will in general decrease. This
argument has elicited much admiration, and was presumably looked upon
by Marx himself with all the satisfaction we are in the habit of feeling if
a theory of ours explains an observation that did not enter into its
construction. It would be interesting to discuss it on its own merits and
independently of the mistakes Marx committed in deriving it. We need not
stay to do so, for it is sufficiently condemned by its premises. But a
cognate though not identical proposition provides both one of the most
important “forces” of Marxian dynamics and the link between the theory
of exploitation and the next story of Marx’s analytic structure, usually
referred to as the Theory of Accumulation.
The main part of the loot wrung from exploited labor (according to
some of the disciples, practically all of it) capitalists turn into capital—
means of production. In itself and barring the connotations called up by
Marx’s phraseology, this is of course no more than a statement of a very
familiar fact ordinarily described in terms of saving and investment. For
Marx however this mere fact was not enough: if the capitalist process was
to unfold in inexorable logic, that fact had to be part of this logic which
means, practically, that it had to be necessary. Nor would it have been
satisfactory to allow this necessity to grow out of the social psychology
of the capitalist class, for instance in a way similar to Max Weber’s who
made Puritan attitudes—and abstaining from hedonist enjoyment of one’s
profits obviously fits well into their pattern—a causal determinant of
capitalist behavior. Marx did not despise any support he felt able to
derive from this method. 10 But there had to be something more substantial
than this for a system designed as his was, something which compels
capitalists to accumulate irrespective of what they feel about it, and
which is powerful enough to account for that psychological pattern itself.
And fortunately there is.
In setting forth the nature of that compulsion to save, I shall for the sake
of convenience accept Marx’s teaching on one point: that is to say, I shall
assume as he does that saving by the capitalist class ipso facto implies a
corresponding increase in real capital. 11 This movement will in the first
10 For instance, in one place (Das Kapital, vol. i, p. 654, of the Everyman
edition) he surpasses himself in picturesque rhetoric on the subject—going, I think,
further than is proper for the author of the economic interpretation of history.
Accumulating may or may not be “Moses and all the prophets”(!) for the capitalist
c l a s s a n d s u c h f l i g h t s m a y o r m a y n o t s t r i ke u s a s r i d i c u l o u s — w i t h M a r x ,
arguments of that type and in that style are always suggestive of some weakness
that must be screened.
11 For Marx, saving or accumulating is identical with conversion of “surplus value into
capital.” With that I do not propose to take issue, though individual attempts at saving do not
Marx the Economist 31
instance always occur in the variable part of total capital, the wage capital,
even if the intention is to increase the constant part and in particular that part
which Ricardo called fixed capital—mainly machinery.
When discussing Marx’s theory of exploitation, I have pointed out that
in a perfectly competitive economy exploitation gains would induce
capitalists to expand production, or to attempt to expand it, because from
the standpoint of every one of them that would mean more profit. In order
to do so they would have to accumulate. Moreover the mass effect of this
would tend to reduce surplus values through the ensuing rise in wage rates,
if not also through an ensuing fall in the prices of products—a very nice
instance of the contradictions inherent in capitalism that were so dear to
Marx’s heart. And that tendency itself would, also for the individual
capitalist, constitute another reason why he should feel compelled to
accumulate, 12 though again that would in the end make matters worse for
the capitalist class as a whole. There would hence be a sort of compulsion
to accumulate even in an otherwise stationary process which, as I
mentioned before, could not reach stable equilibrium until accumulation
had reduced surplus value to zero and thus destroyed capitalism itself. 13
Much more important and much more drastically compelling is
something else, however. As a matter of fact, capitalist economy is not
and cannot be stationary. Nor is it merely expanding in a steady manner.
It is incessantly being revolutionized from within by new enterprise, i.e.,
by the intrusion of new commodities or new methods of production or
new commercial opportunities into the industrial structure as it exists at
any moment. Any existing structures and all the conditions of doing
business are always in a process of change. Every situation is being upset
before it has had time to work itself out. Economic progress, in capitalist
necessarily and automatically increase real capital. Marx’s view seems to me to be so much
nearer the truth than the opposite view sponsored by many of my contemporaries that I do not
think it worth while to challenge it here.
12 Less would of course in general be saved out of a smaller than out of a bigger income.
But more will be saved out of any given income if it is not expected to last or if it is expected
to decrease than would be saved out of the same income if it were known to be at least stable
at its current figure.
13 To some extent Marx recognizes this. But he thinks that if wages rise and thereby interfere
with accumulation, the rate of the latter will decrease “because the stimulus of gain is blunted”
so that “the mechanism of the process of capitalist production removes the very obstacles it
temporarily creates.” (Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xxv, section 1.) Now this tendency of the capitalist
mechanism to equilibrate itself is surely not above question and any assertion of it would
require, to say the least, careful qualification. But the interesting point is that we should call
that statement most un-Marxian if we happened to come across it in the work of another
economist and that, as far as it is tenable, it greatly weakens the main drift of Marx’s argument.
In this point as in many others, Marx displays to an astonishing degree the shackles of the
bourgeois economics of his time which he believed himself to have broken.
The Marxian Doctrine32
society, means turmoil. And, as we shall see in the next part, in this
turmoil competition works in a manner completely different from the way
it would work in a stationary process, however perfectly competitive.
Possibilities of gains to be reaped by producing new things or by
producing old things more cheaply are constantly materializing and
calling for new investments. These new products and new methods
compete with the old products and old methods not on equal terms but
at a decisive advantage that may mean death to the latter. This is how
“progress” comes about in capitalist society. In order to escape being
undersold, every firm is in the end compelled to follow suit, to invest in
its turn and, in order to be able to do so, to plow back part of its profits,
i.e., to accumulate. 14 Thus, everyone else accumulates.
Now Marx saw this process of industrial change more clearly and he
realized its pivotal importance more fully than any other economist of his
time. This does not mean that he correctly understood its nature or
correctly analyzed its mechanism. With him, that mechanism resolves
itself into mere mechanics of masses of capital. He had no adequate
theory of enterprise and his failure to distinguish the entrepreneur from
the capitalist, together with a faulty theoretical technique, accounts for
many cases of non sequitur and for many mistakes. But the mere vision
of the process was in itself sufficient for many of the purposes that Marx
had in mind. The non sequitur ceases to be a fatal objection if what does
not follow from Marx’s argument can be made to follow from another
one; and even downright mistakes and misinterpretations are often
redeemed by the substantial correctness of the general drift of the
argument in the course of which they occur—in particular they may be
rendered innocuous for the further steps of the analysis which, to the
critic who fails to appreciate this paradoxical situation, seem condemned
beyond appeal.
We had an example of this before. Taken as it stands, Marx’s theory of
surplus value is untenable. But since the capitalist process does produce
recurrent waves of temporary surplus gains over cost which, though in a
very un-Marxian way, other theories can account for all right, Marx’s next
step, inscribed to accumulation, is not completely vitiated by his previous
slips. Similarly, Marx himself did not satisfactorily establish that
compulsion to accumulate, which is so essential to his argument. But no
14 That is of course not the only method of financing technological improvement. But
it is practically the only method that Marx considered. Since it actually is a very
important one, we may here follow him in this, though other methods, particularly that
of borrowing from banks, i.e., of creating deposits, produce conse quences of their own,
insertion of which would really be necessary in order to draw a correct picture of the
capitalist process.
Marx the Economist 33
great harm results from the shortcomings of his explanation because, in the
way alluded to, we can readily supply a more satisfactory one ourselves,
in which among other things the fall of profits drops into the right place
by itself. The aggregate rate of profit on total industrial capital need not
fall in the long run, either for the Marxian reason that the constant capital
increases relatively to the variable capital 15 or for any other. It is sufficient
that, as we have seen, the profit of every individual plant is incessantly
being threatened by actual or potential competition from new commodities
or methods of production which sooner or later will turn it into a loss. So
we get the driving force required and even an analogon to Marx’s
proposition that constant capital does not produce surplus value—for no
individual assemblage of capital goods remains a source of surplus gains
forever—without having to rely on those parts of his argument which are
of doubtful validity.
Another example is afforded by the next link in Marx’s chain, his
Theory of Concentration, that is, his treatment of the tendency of the
capitalist process to increase the size both of industrial plants and of
units of control. All he has to offer in explanation, 16 when stripped of
his imagery, boils down to the unexciting statements that “the battle of
competition is fought by cheapening commodities” which “depends,
caeteris paribus, on the productiveness of labor”; that this again
depends on the scale of production; and that “the larger capitals beat
the smaller.” 17 This is much like what the current textbook says on the
matter, and not very deep or admirable in itself. In particular it is
inadequate because of the exclusive emphasis placed on the size of the
individual “capitals” while in his description of effects Marx is much
hampered by his technique which is unable to deal effectively with
either monopoly or oligopoly.
15 According to Marx, profits can of course also fall for another reason, i.e., because of a
fall in the rate of surplus value. That may be due either to increases in wage rates or to
reductions, by legislation for instance, of the daily hours of work. It is possible to argue, even
from the standpoint of Marxian theory, that this will induce “capitalists” to substitute labor-
saving capital goods for labor, and hence also increase investment temporarily irrespective of
the impact of new commodities and of technological progress. Into these questions we cannot
enter however. But we may note a curious incident. In 1837, Nassau W. Senior published a
pamphlet entitled Letters on the Factory Act, in which he tried to show that the proposed
reduction of the duration of the working day would result in the annihilation of profits in the
cotton industry. In Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. vii, section 3. Marx surpasses himself in fierce
indictments against that performance. Senior’s argument is in fact little short of foolish. But
Marx should have been the last person to say so for it is quite in keeping with his own theory
of exploitation.
16 See Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xxv, section 2.
17 This conclusion, often referred to as the theory of expropriation, is with Marx
the only purely economic basis of that struggle by which capitalists destroy one
another.
The Marxian Doctrine34
Yet the admiration so many economists outside the fold profess to feel
for this theory is not unjustified. For one thing, to predict the advent of
big business was, considering the conditions of Marx’s day, an achievement
in itself. But he did more than that. He neatly hitched concentration to the
process of accumulation or rather he visualized the former as part of the
latter, and not only as part of its factual pattern but also of its logic. He
perceived some of the consequences correctly—for instance that “the
increasing bulk of individual masses of capital becomes the material basis
of an uninterrupted revolution in the mode of production itself”—and
others at least in a one-sided or distorted manner. He electrified the
atmosphere surrounding the phenomenon by all the dynamos of class war
and politics—that alone would have been enough to raise his exposition
of it high above the dry economic theorems involved, particularly for
people without any imagination of their own. And, most important of all,
he was able to go on, almost entirely unhampered by the inadequate
motivation of individual traits of his picture and by what to the professional
appears to be lack of stringency in his argument, for after all the industrial
giants actually were in the offing and so was the social situation which they
were bound to create.
5. Two more items will complete this sketch: Marx’s theory of
Verelendung or, to use the English equivalent I have ventured to adopt, of
immiserization, and his (and Engels’) theory of the trade cycle. In the
former, both analysis and vision fail beyond remedy; both show up to
advantage in the latter.
Marx undoubtedly held that in the course of capitalist evolution real
wage rates and the standard of life of the masses would fall in the better-
paid, and fail to improve in the worst-paid, strata and that this would come
about not through any accidental or environmental circumstances but by
virtue of the very logic of the capitalist process. 18 As a prediction, this was
of course singularly infelicitous and Marxists of all types have been hard
put to it to make the best of the clearly adverse evidence that confronted
them. At first, and in some isolated instances even to our day, they
displayed a remarkable tenacity in trying to save that “law” as a statement
of an actual tendency borne out by wage statistics. Then attempts were
18 There is a first-line defense which Marxists, like most apologists, are wont to set against
the critical intention lurking behind any such clear-cut statement. It is that Marx did not entirely
fail to see the other side of the medal and that he very often “recognized” cases of rising wages
and so on—as indeed nobody could possibly fail to do—the implication being that he fully
anticipated whatever a critic might have to say. So prolix a writer who interlards his argument
with such rich layers of historical analysis naturally gives more scope for such defense than
any of the fathers of the church did. But what is the good of “recognizing” recalcitrant fact if
it is not allowed to influence conclusions?
Marx the Economist 35
made to read into it a different meaning, that is to say, to make it refer not
to rates of real wages or to the absolute share that goes to the working class
but to the relative share of labor incomes in total national income. Though
some passages in Marx will in fact bear interpretation in this sense, this
clearly violates the meaning of most. Moreover, little would be gained by
accepting this interpretation, because Marx’s main conclusions presuppose
that the absolute per capita share of labor should fall or, at the very least,
not increase: if he really had been thinking of the relative share that would
only add to Marxian troubles. Finally the proposition itself would still be
wrong. For the relative share of wages and salaries in total income varies
but little from year to year and is remarkably constant over time—it
certainly does not reveal any tendency to fall.
There seems, however, to be another way out of the difficulty. A
tendency may fail to show in our statistical time series—which may
even show the opposite one as they do in this case—and yet it might
be inherent in the system under investigation, for it might be suppressed
by exceptional conditions. This is in fact the line that most modern
Marxists take. The exceptional conditions are found in colonial
expansion or, more generally, in the opening up of new countries during
the nineteenth century, which is held to have brought about a “closed
season” for the victims of exploitation. 19 In the next part we shall have
occasion to touch upon this matter. Meanwhile, let us note that facts
lend some prima facie support to this argument which is also
unexceptionable in logic and therefore might resolve the difficulty if
that tendency were otherwise well established.
But the real trouble is that Marx’s theoretical structure is anything but
trustworthy in that sector: along with the vision, the analytic groundwork
is there at fault. The basis of the theory of immiserization is the theory of
the “industrial reserve army,” i.e., of the unemployment created by the
mechanization of the process of production. 20 And the theory of the reserve
army is in turn based upon the doctrine expounded in Ricardo’s chapter
on machinery. Nowhere else—excepting of course the theory of value—
19 This idea was suggested by Marx himself, though it has been developed by the
Neo-Marxists.
20 This kind of unemployment must of course be distinguished from others. In particular,
Marx notices the kind which owes its existence to the cyclical variations in business activity.
Since the two are not independent and since in his argument he often relies on the latter type
rather than on the former, difficulties of interpretation arise of which not all critics seem to be
fully aware.
21 To any theorist this must be obvious, from a study not only of the sedes materiae, Das
Kapital, vol. i, ch. xv, sections 3, 4, 5, and especially 6 (where Marx deals with the theory of
compensation, to be noted above), but also of chs. xxiv and xxv where, in a partially different
garb, the same things are repeated and elaborated.
The Marxian Doctrine36
does Marx’s argument so completely depend on that of Ricardo without
adding anything essential. 21 I am speaking of course of the pure theory of
the phenomenon only. Marx did add, as always, many minor touches such
as the felicitous generalization by which the replacement of skilled by
unskilled workers is made to enter into the concept of unemployment; also
he added an infinite wealth of illustration and phraseology; and, most
important of all, he added the impressive setting, the wide backgrounds of
his social process.
Ricardo had at first been inclined to share the view, very common at
all times, that the introduction of machines into the productive process
could hardly fail to benefit the masses. When he came to doubt that
opinion or, at all events, its general validity, he with characteristic
frankness revised his position. No less characteristically, he leaned
backwards in doing so and, using his customary method of “imagining
strong cases,” produced a numerical example, well known to all
economists, to show that things could also turn out the other way. He did
not mean to deny, on the one hand, that he was proving no more than a
possibility—a not unlikely one though—or, on the other hand, that in the
end net benefit to labor would result from mechanization through its
ulterior effects on total output, prices and so on.
The example is correct as far as it goes. 22 The somewhat more refined
methods of today support its result to the extent that they admit the
possibility it aimed at establishing as well as the opposite one; they go
beyond it by stating the formal conditions which determine whether the one
or the other consequence will ensue. That is of course all that pure theory
can do. Further data are necessary in order to predict the actual effect. But
for our purpose, Ricardo’s example presents another interesting feature. He
considers a firm owning a given amount of capital and employing a given
number of workmen that decides to take a step in mechanization.
Accordingly, it assigns a group of those workmen to the task of
constructing a machine which when installed will enable the firm to
dispense with part of that group. Profits may eventually remain the same
(after the competitive adjustments which will do away with any temporary
gain) but gross revenue will be destroyed to the exact amount of the wages
previously paid to the workmen that have now been “set free.” Marx’s idea
of the replacement of variable (wage) capital by constant capital is almost
the exact replica of this way of putting it. Ricardo’s emphasis upon the
ensuing redundancy of population is likewise exactly paralleled by Marx’s
22 Or it can be made correct without losing its significance. There are a few doubtful points
about the argument that are probably due to its lamentable technique—which so many
economists would love to perpetuate.
Marx the Economist 37
emphasis upon surplus population which term he uses as an alternative to
the term “industrial reserve army.” Ricardo’s teaching is indeed being
swallowed hook, line and sinker.
But what may pass muster as long as we move within the restricted
purpose Ricardo had in view becomes utterly inadequate—in fact the
source of another non sequitur, not redeemed this time by a correct vision
of ultimate results—as soon as we consider the superstructure Marx
erected on that slender foundation. Some such feeling he seems to have
had himself. For with an energy that has something desperate about it he
clutched the conditionally pessimistic result of his teacher as if the
latter’s strong case were the only possible one, and with energy even
more desperate he fought those authors who had developed the
implications of Ricardo’s hint at compensations that the machine age
might hold out to labor even where the immediate effect of the
introduction of machinery spelled injury (theory of compensation, the pet
aversion of all Marxists).
He had every reason for taking this course. For he badly needed a firm
foundation for his theory of the reserve army which was to serve two
fundamentally important purposes, besides some minor ones. First, we
have seen that he deprived his doctrine of exploitation of what I have
called an essential prop by his aversion, quite understandable in itself,
to making use of the Malthusian theory of population. That prop was
replaced by the ever-present, because ever-recreated 23 reserve army.
Second, the particularly narrow view of the process of mechanization he
adopted was essential in order to motivate the resounding phrases in
Chapter XXXII of the first volume of Das Kapital which in a sense are
the crowning finale not only of that volume but of Marx’s whole work.
I will quote them in full—more fully than the point under discussion
requires—in order to give my readers a glimpse of Marx in the attitude
which accounts equally well for the enthusiasm of some and for the
contempt of others. Whether a compound of things that are not so or the
very heart of prophetic truth, here they are:
“Hand in hand with this centralization, or this expropriation of many
capitalists by few, develops…the entanglement of all nations in the net of
the world market, and with this, the international character of the capitalist
régime. Along with the constantly diminishing number of the magnates of
23 It is of course necessary to stress the incessant creation. It would be quite unfair to
Marx’s words as well as meaning to imagine, as some critics have done, that he assumed
that the introduction of machinery threw people out of work who then would remain
individually unemployed ever after. He did not deny absorption, and criticism that is based
on the proof that any unemployment created with each time be absorbed entirely misses
the target.
The Marxian Doctrine38
capital, who usurp and monopolize all advantages of this process of
transformation, grows the mass of misery, oppression, slavery, degradation,
exploitation; but with this too grows the revolt of the working class, a class
always increasing in numbers, and disciplined, united, organized by the very
mechanism of the process of capitalist production itself. The monopoly of
capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production, which has sprung up
and flourished along with it, and under it. Centralization of the means of
production and socialization of labor at last reach a point where they become
incompatible with their capitalist integument. This integument bursts. The
knell of capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are
expropriated.”
6. Marx’s performance in the field of business cycles is exceedingly
difficult to appraise. The really valuable part of it consists of dozens of
observations and comments, most of them of a casual nature, which are
scattered over almost all his writings, many of his letters included. Attempts
at reconstruction from such membra disjecta of a body that nowhere appears
in the flesh and perhaps did not even exist in Marx’s own mind except in
an embryonic form, may easily yield different results in different hands and
be vitiated by the understandable tendency of the admirer to credit Marx,
by means of suitable interpretation, with practically all those results of later
research of which the admirer himself approves.
The common run of friends and foes never realized and does not realize
now the kind of task which confronts the commentator because of the nature
of Marx’s kaleidoscopic contribution to that subject. Seeing that Marx so
frequently pronounced upon it and that it was obviously very relevant to his
fundamental theme, they took it for granted that there must be some simple
and clear-cut Marxian cycle theory which it should be possible to make grow
out of the rest of his logic of the capitalist process much as, for instance,
the theory of exploitation grows out of the labor theory. Accordingly they
set about finding such a theory, and it is easy to guess what it was that
occurred to them.
On the one hand, Marx no doubt extols—though he does not quite
adequately motivate—the tremendous power of capitalism to develop
society’s capacity to produce. On the other hand, he incessantly places
emphasis on the growing misery of the masses. Is it not the most natural
thing in the world to conclude that crises or depressions are due to the
fact that the exploited masses cannot buy what that ever-expanding
apparatus of production turns out or stands ready to turn out, and that
for this and also other reasons which we need not repeat the rate of
profits drops to bankruptcy level? Thus we seem indeed to land,
according to which element we want to stress, at the shores of either an
Marx the Economist 39
under-consumption or an over-production theory of the most
contemptible type.
The Marxian explanation has in fact been classed with the under-
consumption theories of crises. 24 There are two circumstances that may be
invoked in support. First, in the theory of surplus value and also in other
matters, the affinity of Marx’s teachings with that of Sismondi and Rodbertus
is obvious. And these men did espouse the under-consumption view. It was
not unnatural to infer that Marx might have done the same. Second, some
passages in Marx’s works particularly the brief statement about crises
contained in the Communist Manifesto undoubtedly lend themselves to this
interpretation, though Engels’ utterances do so much more. 25 But this is of
no account since Marx, showing excellent sense, expressly repudiated it. 26
The fact is that he had no simple theory of business cycles. And none can
be made to follow logically from his “laws” of the capitalist process. Even
if we accept his explanation of the emergence of surplus value and agree to
allow that accumulation, mechanization (relative increase of constant capital)
and surplus population, the latter inexorably deepening mass misery, do link
up into a logical chain that ends in the catastrophe of the capitalist system—
even then we are left without a factor that would necessarily impart of
cyclical fluctuation to the process and account for an immanent alternation
of prosperities and depressions. 27 No doubt plenty of accidents and incidents
24 Though this interpretation has become a fashion, I will mention two authors only, one of
whom is responsible for a modified version of it, while the other may testify to its persistence:
Tugan-Baranowsky, Theoretische Grundlagen des Marxismus, 1905, who condemned Marx’s
theory of crises on that ground; and M.Dobb, Political Economy and Capitalism, 1937, who is
more sympathetic toward it.
25 Engels’ somewhat commonplace view of the matter is best expressed in his polemical
book entitled Herrn Eugen Dührings Umwälzung der Wissenschaft, 1878, in what has become
one of the most frequently quoted passages in socialist literature. He presents there a very
graphic account of the morphology of crises that is good enough no doubt for the purposes of
popular lectures, but also the opinion, standing in the place in which one would look for an
explanation, that “the expansion of the market cannot keep pace with the expansion of
production.” Also he approvingly refers to Fourier’s opinion, conveyed by the self-explanatory
phrase, crises pléthoriques. It cannot be denied however that Marx wrote part of ch. x and shares
responsibility for the whole book.
I observe that the few comments on Engels that are contained in this sketch are of a
derogatory nature. This is unfortunate and not due to any intention to belittle the merits of that
eminent man. I do think however that it should be frankly admitted that intellectually and
especially as a theorist he stood far below Marx. We cannot even be sure that he always got
the latter’s meaning. His interpretations must therefore be used with care.
26 Das Kapital, vol. ii, p. 476, of the English translation of 1907. See, however, also Theorien
über den Mehrwert, vol. ii, ch. iii.
27 To the layman, the opposite seems so obvious that it would not be easy to establish this
statement, even if we had all the space in the world. The best way for the reader to convince
himself of its truth is to study Ricardo’s argument on machinery. The process there described
might cause any amount of unemployment and yet go on indefinitely without causing a
breakdown other than the final one of the system itself. Marx would have agreed with this.
The Marxian Doctrine40
are always at hand for us to draw upon in order to make up for the missing
fundamental explanation. There are miscalculations, mistaken expectations
and other errors, waves of optimism and pessimism, speculative excesses and
reactions to speculative excesses, and there is the inexhaustible source of
“external factors.” All the same, Marx’s mechanical process of accumulation
going on at an even rate—and there is nothing to show why, on principle, it
should not—the process he describes might also go on at even rates; as far
as its logic is concerned, it is essentially prosperityless and depressionless.
Of course this is not necessarily a misfortune. Many other theorists
have held and do hold simply that crises happen whenever something
of sufficient importance goes wrong. Nor was it altogether a handicap
because it released Marx, for once, from the thralldom of his system
and set him free to look at facts without having to do violence to them.
Accordingly, he considers a wide variety of more or less relevant
elements. For instance, he uses somewhat superficially the intervention
of money in commodity transactions—and nothing else—in order to
invalidate Say’s proposition about the impossibility of a general glut;
or easy money markets in order to explain disproportionate
developments in the lines characterized by heavy investment in durable
capital goods; or special stimuli such as the opening of markets or the
emergence of new social wants in order to motivate sudden spurts in
“accumulation.” He tries, not very successfully, to turn the growth of
population into a factor making for fluctuations. 28 He observes, though
he does not really explain, that the scale of production expands “by fits
and starts” that are “the preliminary to its equally sudden contraction.”
He aptly says that “the superficiality of Political Economy shows itself
in the fact that it looks upon expansion and contraction of credit, which
is a mere symptom of the periodic changes of the industrial cycle, as
their cause.” 29 And the chapter of incidents and accidents he of course
lays under heavy contribution.
All that is common sense and substantially sound. We find practically
all the elements that ever entered into any serious analysis of business
cycles, and on the whole very little error. Moreover, it must not be
forgotten that the mere perception of the existence of cyclical movements
28 In this also he does not stand alone. However it is but fair to him to expect that he would
eventually have seen the weaknesses of this approach, and it is relevant to note that his remarks
on the subject occur in the third volume and cannot be trusted to render what might have been
his final view.
29 Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xxv, section 3. Immediately after this passage he takes a step in
a direction that is also very familiar to the student of modern business cycle theories: “Effects,
in their turn become causes, and the varying accidents of the whole process, which always
reproduces its own conditions [my italics], take on the form of periodicity.”
Marx the Economist 41
was a great achievement at the time. Many economists who went before
him had an inkling of it. In the main, however, they focused their
attention on the spectacular breakdowns that came to be referred to as
“crises.” And those crises they failed to see in their true light, that is to
say, in the light of the cyclical process of which they are mere incidents.
They considered them, without looking beyond or below, as isolated
misfortunes that will happen in consequence of errors, excesses,
misconduct or of the faulty working of the credit mechanism. Marx was,
I believe, the first economist to rise above that tradition and to
anticipate—barring the statistical complement—the work of Clément
Juglar. Though, as we have seen, he did not offer an adequate explanation
of the business cycle, the phenomenon stood clearly before his eyes and
he understood much of its mechanism. Also like Juglar, he unhesitatingly
spoke of a decennial cycle “interrupted by minor fluctuations.” 30 He was
intrigued by the question of what the cause of that period might be and
considered the idea that it might have something to do with the life of
machinery in the cotton industry. And there are many other signs of
preoccupation with the problem of business cycles as distinguished from
that of crises. This is enough to assure him high rank among the fathers
of modern cycle research.
Another aspect must be mentioned. In most cases Marx used the term
crisis in its ordinary sense, speaking of the crisis of 1825 or that of 1847 as
other people do. But he also used it in a different sense. Believing that
capitalist evolution would some day disrupt the institutional framework of
capitalist society, he thought that before the actual breakdown occurred,
capitalism would begin to work with increasing friction and display the
symptoms of fatal illness. To this stage, to be visualized of course as a more
or less prolonged historical period, he applied the same term. And he
displays a tendency to link those recurrent crises with this unique crisis of
the capitalist order. He even suggests that the former may in a sense be
looked upon as previews of the ultimate breakdown. Since to many readers
this might look like a clue to Marx’s theory of crises in the ordinary sense,
it is necessary to point out that the factors which according to Marx will be
30 Engels went further than this. Some of his notes to Marx’s third volume reveal that he
suspected also the existence of a longer swing. Though he was inclined to interpret the
comparative weakness of prosperities and the comparative intensity of depressions in the
seventies and eighties as a structural change rather than as the effect of the depression phase
of a wave of longer span (exactly as many modern economists do with respect to the post-war
developments and especially to those of the last decade) some anticipation of Kondratieff’s work
on Long Cycles might he seen in this.
31 In order to convince himself of this, the reader need only glance again at the quotation
on p. 37. In fact, though Marx so often plays with the idea, he avoids committing himself to
it, which is significant because it was not his way to miss the opportunity for a generalization.
The Marxian Doctrine42
responsible for the ultimate breakdown cannot, without a good dose of
additional hypotheses, be made responsible for the recurrent depressions, 31
and that the clue does not get us beyond the trivial proposition that the
“expropriation of the expropriators” may be an easier matter in a depression
than it would be in a boom.
7. Finally, the idea that capitalist evolution will burst—or outgrow—the
institutions of capitalist society (Zusammenbruchstheorie, the theory of the
inevitable catastrophe) affords a last example of the combination of a non
sequitur with profound vision which helps to rescue the result.
Based as Marx’s “dialectic deduction” is on the growth of misery and
oppression that will goad the masses into revolt, it is invalidated by the non
sequitur that vitiates the argument which was to establish that inevitable
growth of misery. Moreover, otherwise orthodox Marxists have long ago
begun to doubt the validity of the proposition that concentration of industrial
control is necessarily incompatible with the “capitalist integument.” The first
of them to voice this doubt by means of a well-organized argument was
Rudolf Hilferding, 32 one of the leaders of the important group of Neo-
Marxists, who actually inclined toward the opposite inference, viz., that
through concentration capitalism might gain in stability. 33 Deferring to the
next part what I have to say upon the matter, I will state that Hilferding
seems to me to go too far although there is, as we shall see, no foundation
for the belief, at present current in this country, that big business “becomes
a fetter upon the mode of production,” and although Marx’s conclusion does
in fact not follow from his premises.
However, even though Marx’s facts and reasoning were still more at fault
than they are, his result might nevertheless be true so far as it simply avers
that capitalist evolution will destroy the foundations of capitalist society. I
believe it is. And I do not think I am exaggerating if I call profound a vision
in which that truth stood revealed beyond doubt in 1847. It is a commonplace
now. The first to make it that was Gustav Schmoller. His Excellency,
Professor Von Schmoller, Prussian Privy Councellor and Member of the
32 Das Finanzkapital, 1910. Doubts based on a number of secondary circumstances that were
held to show that Marx made too much of the tendencies he thought he had established and
that social evolution was a much more complex and a much less consistent process than he
made out, had of course often arisen before. It is sufficient to mention E.Bernstein; see ch. xxvi.
But Hilferding’s analysis does not plead extenuating circumstances, but fights that conclusion
on principle and on Marx’s own ground.
33 This proposition has often (even by its author) been confused with the proposition
that business fluctuations tend to become milder as time goes on. That may or may not be
so (1929–32 would not disprove it) but greater stability of the capitalist system, i.e., a
somewhat less temperamental behavior of our time series of prices and quantities, does not
necessarily imply, nor is it necessarily implied by, greater stability, i.e., a greater ability
of the capitalist order to withstand attack. Both things are related, of course, but they are
not the same.
Marx the Economist 43
Prussian House of Lords, was not much of a revolutionary or much given
to agitatorial gesticulations. But he quietly stated the same truth. The Why
and How of it he likewise left unsaid.
It is hardly necessary to sum up elaborately. However imperfect, our
sketch should suffice to establish: first, that nobody who cares at all for
purely economic analysis can speak of unqualified success; second, that
nobody who cares at all for bold construction can speak of unqualified
failure.
In the court that sits on theoretical technique, the verdict must be adverse.
Adherence to an analytic apparatus that always had been inadequate and was
in Marx’s own day rapidly becoming obsolete; a long list of conclusions that
do not follow or are downright wrong; mistakes which if corrected change
essential inferences, sometimes into their opposites—all this can be rightfully
charged against Marx, the theoretical technician.
Even in that court, however, qualification of the verdict will be necessary
on two grounds.
First, though Marx was often—sometimes hopelessly—wrong, his critics
were far from being always right. Since there were excellent economists
among them, the fact should be recorded to his credit, particularly because
most of them he was not able to meet himself.
Second, so should Marx’s contributions, both critical and positive, to a
great many individual problems. In a sketch like this, it is not possible to
enumerate them, let alone to do them justice. But we have had a view of
some of them in our discussion of his treatment of the business cycle. I have
also mentioned some that improved our theory of the structure of physical
capital. The schemata which he devised in that field, though not
irreproachable, have again proved serviceable in recent work that looks quite
Marxian in places.
But a court of appeal—even though still confined to theoretical matters—
might feel inclined to reverse this verdict altogether. For there is one truly
great achievement to be set against Marx’s theoretical misdemeanors.
Through all that is faulty or even unscientific in his analysis runs a
fundamental idea that is neither—the idea of a theory, not merely of an
indefinite number of disjointed individual patterns or of the logic of
economic quantities in general, but of the actual sequence of those patterns
or of the economic process as it goes on, under its own steam, in historic
time, producing at every instant that state which will of itself determine the
next one. Thus, the author of so many misconceptions was also the first to
visualize what even at the present time is still the economic theory of the
future for which we are slowly and laboriously accumulating stone and
mortar, statistical facts and functional equations.
The Marxian Doctrine44
And he not only conceived that idea, but he tried to carry it out All the
shortcomings that disfigure his work must, because of the great purpose his
argument attempted to serve, be judged differently even where they are not,
as they are in some cases, fully redeemed thereby. There is however one
thing of fundamental importance for the methodology of economics which
he actually achieved. Economists always have either themselves done work
in economic history or else used the historical work of others. But the facts
of economic history were assigned to a separate compartment. They entered
theory, if at all, merely in the role of illustrations, or possibly of verifications
of results. They mixed with it only mechanically. Now Marx’s mixture is a
chemical one; that is to say, he introduced them into the very argument that
produces the results. He was the first economist of top rank to see and to
teach systematically how economic theory may be turned into historical
analysis and how the historical narrative may be turned into histoire
raisonnée. 34 the analogous problem with respect to statistics he did not
attempt to solve. But in a sense it is im plied in the other. This also answers
the question how far, in the way explained at the end of the preceding
chapter, Marx’s economic theory succeeds in implementing his sociological
setup. It does not succeed; but in failing, it establishes both a goal and a
method.
34 If devoted disciples should therefore claim that he set the goal for the historical school
of economics, that claim could not be lightly dismissed, though the work of the Schmoller
school was certainly quite independent of Marx’s suggestion. But if they went on to claim that
Marx, and Marx only, knew how to rationalize history, whereas the men of the historical school
only knew how to describe facts without getting at their meaning, they would be spoiling their
case. For those men as a matter of fact knew how to analyze. If their generalizations were less
sweeping and their narratives less selective, that is all to their credit.

CHAPTER IV
MARX THE TEACHER
THE main components of the Marxian structure are now before us. What
about the imposing synthesis as a whole? The question is not otiose. If
ever it is true, it is in this case that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.
Moreover, the synthesis may have so spoiled the wheat or so utilized the chaff,
both of which are present in almost every spot, that the whole might be more
true or more false than any part of it is, taken by itself. Finally, there is the
Message that proceeds only from the whole. Of the latter however no more
will be said. Each of us must settle for himself what it means to him.
Our time revolts against the inexorable necessity of specialization and
therefore cries out for synthesis, nowhere so loudly as in the social sciences
in which the non-professional element counts for so much. 1 But Marx’s
system illustrates well that, though synthesis may mean new light, it also
means new fetters.
We have seen how in the Marxian argument sociology and economics
pervade each other. In intent, and to some degree also in actual practice, they
are one. All the major concepts and propositions are hence both economic
and sociological and carry the same meaning on both planes—if, from our
standpoint, we may still speak of two planes of argument. Thus, the
economic category “labor” and the social class “proletariat” are, on principle
at least, made congruent, in fact identical. Or the economists’ functional
distribution—that is to say, the explanation of the way in which incomes
emerge as returns to productive services irrespective of what social class any
recipient of such a return may belong to—enters the Marxian system only
in the form of distribution between social classes and thus acquires a
different connotation. Or capital in the Marxian system is capital only if in
the hands of a distinct capitalist class. The same things, if in the hands of
the workmen, are not capital.
There cannot be any doubt about the access of vitality which comes to
analysis thereby. The ghostly concepts of economic theory begin to breathe.
1 The non-professional element is particularly strongly represented among those admirers
of Marx who, going beyond the attitude of the typical Marxian economist, still take at face value
everything he wrote. This is very significant. In every national group of Marxists there are at
least three laymen to every trained economist and even this economist is as a rule a Marxist
only in that qualified sense defined in the introduction to this part: he worships at the shrine,
but he turns his back upon it when he does his research.
The Marxian Doctrine46
The bloodless theorem descends into agmen, pulverem et clamorem; without
losing its logical quality, it is no longer a mere proposition about the logical
properties of a system of abstractions; it is the stroke of a brush that is
painting the wild jumble of social life. Such analysis conveys not only richer
meaning of what all economic analysis describes but it embraces a much
broader field—it draws every kind of class action into its picture, whether
or not this class action conforms to the ordinary rules of business procedure.
Wars, revolutions, legislation of all types, changes in the structure of
governments, in short all the things that non-Marxian economics treats
simply as external disturbances do find their places side by side with, say,
investment in machinery or bargains with labor—everything is covered by
a single explanatory schema.
At the same time, such procedure has its shortcomings. Conceptual
arrangements that are subject to a yoke of this kind may easily lose in
efficiency as much as they gain in vividness. The pair, worker-proletarian, may
serve as a telling if somewhat trite example. In non-Marxian economics all
returns to services of persons partake of the nature of wages, whether those
persons are tophole lawyers, movie stars, company executives or street
sweepers. Since all these returns have, from the standpoint of the economic
phenomenon involved, much in common, this generalization is not futile or
sterile. On the contrary, it may be enlightening, even for the sociological aspect
of things. But by equating labor and proletariat we obscure it; in fact, we
entirely banish it from our picture. Similarly, a valuable economic theorem
may by its sociological metamorphosis pick up error instead of richer meaning
and vice versa. Thus, synthesis in general and synthesis on Marxian lines in
particular might easily issue in both worse economics and worse sociology.
Synthesis in general, i.e., coordination of the methods and results of
different lines of advance, is a difficult thing which few are competent to
tackle. In consequence it is ordinarily not tackled at all and from the students
who are taught to see only individual trees we hear discontented clamor for
the forest. They fail to realize however that the trouble is in part an embarras
de richesse and that the synthetic forest may look uncommonly like an
intellectual concentration camp.
Synthesis on Marxian lines, i.e., coordination of economic and sociological
analysis with a view to bending everything to a single purpose, is of course
particularly apt to look like that. The purpose—that histoire raisonnée of
capitalist society—is wide enough but the analytic setup is not. There is indeed
a grand wedding of political facts and of economic theorems; but they are
wedded by force and neither of them can breathe. Marxists claim that their
system solves all the great problems that baffle non-Marxian economics; so it
does but only by emasculating them. This point calls for some elaboration.
Marx the Teacher 47
I said a moment ago that Marx’s synthesis embraces all those historical
events—such as wars, revolutions, legislative changes—and all those social
institutions—such as property, contractual relations, forms of government—
that non-Marxian economists are wont to treat as disturbing factors or as
data, which means that they do not propose to explain them but only to
analyze their modi operandi and consequences. Such factors or data are of
course necessary in order to delimit the object and range of any research
program whatsoever. If they are not always expressly specified, that is only
because everyone is expected to know what they are. The trait peculiar to
the Marxian system is that it subjects those historical events and social
institutions themselves to the explanatory process of economic analysis or,
to use the technical lingo, that it treats them not as data but as variables.
Thus the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the American Civil War, the
World War of 1914, the French Frondes, the great French Revolution, the
revolutions of 1830 and 1848, English free trade, the labor movement as a
whole as well as any of its particular manifestations, colonial expansion,
institutional changes, the national and party politics of every time and
country—all this enters the domain of Marxian economics which claims to
find theoretical explanations in terms of class warfare, of attempts at and
revolt against exploitation, of accumulation and of qualitative change in the
capital structure, of changes in the rate of surplus value and in the rate of
profit. No longer has the economist to be content with giving technical
answers to technical questions; instead, he teaches humanity the hidden
meaning of its struggles. No longer is “politics” an independent factor that
may and must be abstracted from in an investigation of fundamentals and,
when it does intrude, plays according to one’s preferences either the role of
a naughty boy who viciously tampers with a machine when the engineer’s
back is turned, or else the role of a deus ex machina by virtue of the
mysterious wisdom of a doubtful species of mammals deferentially referred
to as “statesmen.” No—politics itself is being determined by the structure
and state of the economic process and becomes a conductor of effects as
completely within the range of economic theory as any purchase or sale.
Once more, nothing is easier to understand than the fascination exerted by
a synthesis which does for us just this. It is particularly understandable in the
young and in those intellectual denizens of our newspaper world to whom the
gods seem to have granted the gift of eternal youth. Panting with impatience
to have their innings, longing to save the world from something or other,
disgusted with textbooks of un-describable tedium, dissatisfied emotionally and
intellectually, unable to achieve synthesis by their own effort, they find what
they crave for in Marx. There it is, the key to all the most intimate secrets,
the magic wand that marshals both great events and small. They are beholding
The Marxian Doctrine48
an explanatory schema that at the same time is—if I may for a moment lapse
into Hegelianism—most general and most concrete. They need no longer feel
out of it in the great affairs of life—all at once they see through the pompous
marionettes of politics and business who never know what it is all about. And
who can blame them, considering available alternatives?
Yes, of course—but apart from that, what does this service of the
Marxian synthesis amount to? I wonder. The humble economist who
describes England’s transition to free trade or the early achievements of
English factory legislation is not, and never was, likely to forget to mention
the structural conditions of the English economy that produced those
policies. If he does not do so in a course or book on pure theory that
merely makes for neater and and more efficient analysis. What the Marxist
has to add is only the insistence on the principle, and a particularly narrow
and warped theory by which to implement it. This theory yields results no
doubt, and very simple and definite ones to boot. But we need only apply
it systematically to individual cases in order to grow thoroughly weary of
the unending jingle about the class war between owners and non-owners
and to become aware of a painful sense of inadequacy or, worse still, of
triviality—of the former, if we do not swear by the underlying schema; of
the latter, if we do.
Marxists are in the habit of pointing triumphantly to the success of the
Marxian diagnosis of the economic and social tendencies that are supposed
to be inherent in capitalist evolution. As we have seen, there is some
justification for this: more clearly than any other writer of his day Marx
discerned the trend toward big business and not only that but also some of
the features of the consequent situations. We have also seen that in this case
vision lent its aid to analysis so as to remedy some of the shortcomings of
the latter and to make the import of the synthesis truer than the contributing
elements of the analysis were themselves. But this is all. And against the
achievement must be set the failure of the prediction of increasing misery,
the joint result of wrong vision and faulty analysis, on which a great many
Marxian speculations about the future course of social events had been
based, He who places his trust in the Marxian synthesis as a whole in order
to understand present situations and problems is apt to be woefully wrong. 2
This seems in fact to be felt by many a Marxist just now.
2 Some Marxists would reply that non-Marxian economists have simply nothing to contribute
to our understanding of our time so that the disciple of Marx is nevertheless better off in that
respect. Waiving the question of whether it is better to say nothing or to say something that is
wrong, we should bear in mind that this is not true, for both economists and sociologists of
non-Marxian persuasions have as a matter of fact contributed substantially though mostly on
individual questions. Least of all can this Marxist claim be based on a comparison of Marx’s
teachings with that of the Austrians or of the Walras or Marshall schools. The members of these

In particular there is no reason for taking pride in the manner in which
the Marxian synthesis accounts for the experience of the last decade. Any
prolonged period of depression or of unsatisfactory recovery will verify
any pessimistic forecast exactly as well as it verifies the Marxian one. In
this case an impression to the contrary is created by the talk of
disheartened bourgeois and elated intellectuals which naturally acquired a
Marxian hue from their fears and hopes. But no actual fact warrants any
specifically Marxian diagnosis, still less an inference to the effect that what
we have been witnessing was not simply a depression, but the symptoms
of a structural change in the capitalist process such as Marx expected to
occur. For, as will be noted in the next part, all the phenomena observed
such as supernormal unemployment, lack of investment opportunity,
shrinkage of money values, losses and so on, come within the well-known
pattern of periods of predominating depression such as the seventies and
eighties on which Engels commented with a restraint that should set an
example to ardent followers of today.
Two outstanding examples will illustrate both the merits and the demerits
of the Marxian synthesis considered as a problem-solving engine.
First we will consider the Marxist theory of Imperialism. Its roots are all
to be found in Marx’s chief work, but it has been developed by the Neo-
Marxist school which flourished in the first two decades of this century and,
without renouncing communion with the old defenders of the faith, such as
Karl Kautsky, did much to overhaul the system. Vienna was its center; Otto
Bauer, Rudolf Hilferding, Max Adler were its leaders. In the field of
imperialism their work was continued, with but secondary shifts of emphasis,
by many others, prominent among whom were Rosa Luxemburg and Fritz
Sternberg. The argument runs as follows.
Since, on the one hand, capitalist society cannot exist and its economic
system cannot function without profits and since, on the other hand, profits
are constantly being eliminated by the very working of that system,
incessant effort to keep them alive becomes the central aim of the capitalist
class. Accumulation accompanied by qualitative change in the composition
of capital is, as we have seen, a remedy which though alleviating for the
moment the situation of the individual capitalist makes matters worse in
the end. So capital, yielding to the pressure of a falling rate of profits—it
falls, we recall, both because constant capital increases relative to variable
capital and because, if wages tend to rise and hours are being shortened,
the rate of surplus
groups were in most cases wholly, in all cases mainly, interested in economic theory. This
performance is hence incommensurable with Marx’s synthesis. It could only be compared with
Marx’s theoretical apparatus and in that field comparison is all to their advantage.
The Marxian Doctrine50
value falls—seeks for outlets in countries in which there is still labor
that can be exploited at will and in which the process of mechanization
has not as yet gone far. Thus we get an export of capital into undeveloped
countries which is essentially an export of capital equipment or of
consumers’ goods to be used in order to buy labor or to acquire things
with which to buy labor. 3 But it is also export of capital in the ordinary
sense of the term because the exported commodities will not be paid
for—at least not immediately—by goods, services or money from the
importing country. And it turns into colonization if, in order to safeguard
the investment both against hostile reaction of the native environment—
or if you please, against its resistance to exploitation—and against
competition from other capitalist countries, the undeveloped country is
brought into political subjection. This is in general accomplished by
military force supplied either by the colonizing capitalists themselves or
by their home government which thus lives up to the definition given in
the Communist Manifesto: “the executive of the modern State [is]…a
committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”
Of course, that force will not be used for defensive purposes only. There
will be conquest, friction between the capitalist countries and internecine
war between rival bourgeoisies.
Another element completes this theory of imperialism as it is now
usually presented. So far as colonial expansion is prompted by a falling
rate of profit in the capitalist countries, it should occur in the later stages
of capitalist evolution—Marxists in fact speak of imperialism as a stage,
preferably the last stage, of capitalism. Hence it would coincide with a
high degree of concentration of capitalist control over industry and with
a decline of the type of competition that characterized the times of the
small or medium-sized firm. Marx himself did not lay much stress on the
resulting tendency toward monopolistic restriction of output and on the
consequent tendency toward protecting the domestic game preserve
against the intrusion of poachers from other capitalist countries. Perhaps
he was too competent an economist to trust this line of argument too far.
But the Neo-Marxists were glad to avail themselves of it. Thus we get
not only another stimulus for imperialist policy and another source of
imperialist imbroglios but also, as a by-product, a theory of a
3 Think of luxuries to be traded to chieftains against slaves or to be traded against wage
goods with which to hire native labor. For the sake of brevity, I do not take account of the fact
that capital export in the sense envisaged will in general arise as a part of the total trade of
the two countries which also includes commodity transactions unconnected with the particular
process we have in mind. These transactions of course greatly facilitate that capital export, but
do not affect its principle. I shall also neglect other types of capital exports. The theory under
discussion is not, and is not intended to be, a general theory of international trade and finance.
Marx the Teacher 51
phenomenon that is not necessarily imperialist in itself, modern
protectionism.
Note one more hitch in that process that will stand the Marxist in good
stead in the task of explaining further difficulties. When the undeveloped
countries have been developed, capital export of the kind we have been
considering will decline. There may then be a period during which the
mother country and the colony will exchange, say, manufactured products
for raw materials. But in the end the exports of manufacturers will also
have to decline while colonial competition will assert itself in the mother
country. Attempts to retard the advent of that state of things will provide
further sources of friction, this time between each old capitalist country and
its colonies, of wars of independence and so on. But in any case colonial
doors will eventually be closed to domestic capital which will no longer
be able to flee from vanishing profits at home into richer pastures abroad.
Lack of outlets, excess capacity, complete deadlock, in the end regular
recurrence of national bankruptcies and other disasters—perhaps world
wars from sheer capitalist despair—may confidently be anticipated. History
is as simple as that.
This theory is a fair—perhaps it is the best—example of the way in
which the Marxian synthesis attempts to solve problems and acquires
authority by doing so. The whole thing seems to follow beautifully from
two fundamental premises that are both firmly embedded in the
groundwork of the system: the theory of classes and the theory of
accumulation. A series of vital facts of our time seems to be perfectly
accounted for. The whole maze of international politics seems to be cleared
up by a single powerful stroke of analysis. And we see in the process why
and how class action, always remaining intrinsically the same, assumes the
form of political or of business action according to circumstances that
determine nothing but tactical methods and phraseology. If, the means and
opportunities at the command of a group of capitalists being what they are,
it is more profitable to negotiate a loan, a loan will be negotiated. If, the
means and opportunities being what they are, it is more profitable to make
war, war will be made. The latter alternative is no less entitled to enter
economic theory than the former. Even mere protectionism now grows
nicely out of the very logic of capitalist evolution.
Moreover, this theory displays to full advantage a virtue that it has in
common with most of the Marxian concepts in the field of what is usually
referred to as applied economics. This is its close alliance with historical and
contemporaneous fact. Probably not one reader has perused my résumé
without being struck by the ease with which supporting historical instances
crowded in upon him at every single step of the argument. Has he not heard
The Marxian Doctrine52
of the oppression by Europeans of native labor in many parts of the world,
of what South and Central American Indians suffered at the hands of the
Spaniards for instance, or of slave-hunting and slave-trading and coolieism?
Is capital export not actually ever-present in capitalist countries? Has it not
almost invariably been accompanied by military conquest that served to
subdue the natives and to fight other European powers? Has not colonization
always had a rather conspicuous military side, even when managed entirely
by business corporations such as the East India Company or the British
South Africa Company? What better illustration could Marx himself have
desired than Cecil Rhodes and the Boer War? Is it not pretty obvious that
colonial ambitions were, to say the least, an important factor in European
troubles, at all events since about 1700? As for the present time, who has
not heard, on the one hand, about the “strategy of raw materials” and, on
the other hand, of the repercussions on Europe of the growth of native
capitalism in the tropics? And so on. As to protectionism—well, that is as
plain as anything can be.
But we had better be careful. An apparent verification by prima facie
favorable cases which are not analyzed in detail may be very deceptive.
Moreover, as every lawyer and every politician knows, energetic appeal to
familiar facts will go a long way toward inducing a jury or a parliament to
accept also the construction he desires to put upon them. Marxists have
exploited this technique to the full. In this instance it is particularly
successful, because the facts in question combine the virtues of being
superficially known to everyone and of being thoroughly understood by very
few. In fact, though we cannot enter into detailed discussion here, even hasty
reflection suffices to suggest a suspicion that “it is not so.”
A few remarks will be made in the next part on the relation in which the
bourgeoisie stands to imperialism. We shall now consider the question
whether, if the Marxian interpretation of capital export, colonization and
protectionism were correct, it would also be adequate as a theory of all the
phenomena we think of when using that loose and misused term. Of course
we can always define imperialism in such a way as to mean just what the
Marxian interpretation implies; and we can always profess ourselves
convinced that all those phenomena must be explainable in the Marxian
manner. But then the problem of imperialism—always granting that the
4 The danger of empty tautologies being put over on us is best illustrated by individual cases.
Thus, France conquered Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, and Italy conquered Abyssinia, by
military force without there being any significant capitalist interests to press for it. As a matter
of fact, presence of such interests was a pretense that was very difficult to establish, and the
subsequent development of such interests was a slow process that went on, unsatisfactorily
enough, under government pressure. If that should not look very Marxist, it will be replied that
action was taken under pressure of potential or anticipated capitalist interests or that in the last
Marx the Teacher 53
theory is in itself correct—would be “solved” only tautologically. 4 Whether
the Marxian approach or, for that matter, any purely economic approach
yields a solution that is not tautological would still have to be considered
This, however, need not concern us here, because the ground gives way
before we get that far.
At first sight, the theory seems to fit some cases tolerably well. The
most important instances are afforded by the English and Dutch conquests
in the tropics. But other cases, such as the colonization of New England,
it does not fit at all. And even the former type of case is not satisfactorily
described by the Marxian theory of imperialism. It would obviously not
suffice to recognize that the lure of gain played a role in motivating
colonial expansion. 5 The Neo-Marxists did not mean to aver such a horrible
platitude. If these cases are to count for them, it is also necessary that
colonial expansion came about, in the way indicated, under pressure of
accumulation on the rate of profit, hence as a feature of decaying, or at
all events of fully matured, capitalism. But the heroic time of colonial
adventure was precisely the time of early and immature capitalism when
accumulation was in its beginnings and any such pressure—also, in
particular, any barrier to exploitation of domestic labor—was conspicuous
by its absence. The element of monopoly was not absent. On the contrary
it was far more evident than it is today. But that only adds to the absurdity
of the construction which makes both monopoly and conquest specific
properties of latter-day capitalism.
Moreover, the other leg of the theory, class struggle, is in no better
condition. One must wear blinkers to concentrate on that aspect of colonial
expansion which hardly ever played more than a secondary role, and to
construe in terms of class struggle a phenomenon which affords some of
the most striking instances of class cooperation. It was as much a
movement toward higher wages as it was a movement toward higher
profits, and in the long run it certainly benefited (in part because of the
exploitation of native labor) the proletariat more than it benefited the
analysis some capitalist interest or objective necessity “must” have been at the bottom of it.
And we can then hunt for corroboratory evidence that will never be entirely lacking, since
capitalist interests, like any others, will in fact be affected by, and take advantage of, any
situation whatsoever, and since the particular conditions of the capitalist organism will always
present some features which may without absurdity be linked up with those policies of national
expansion. Evidently it is preconceived conviction and nothing else that keeps us going in a
task as desperate as this; without such a conviction it would never occur to us to embark upon
5 Nor is it sufficient to stress the fact that each country actually did “exploit” its colonies.
For that was exploitation of a country as a whole by a country as a whole (of all classes by all
classes) and has nothing to do with the specifically Marxian kind of exploitation. it. And we
really need not take the trouble; we might just as well say that “it must be so” and leave it at
that. This is what I meant by tautological explanation.
The Marxian Doctrine54
capitalist interest. But I do not wish to stress its effects. The essential point
is that its causation has not much to do with class warfare, and not more
to do with class structure than is implied in the leadership of groups and
individuals that belonged to, or by colonial enterprise rose into, the
capitalist class. If however we shake off the blinkers and cease to look
upon colonization or imperialism as a mere incident in class warfare, little
remains that is specifically Marxist about the matter. What Adam Smith has
to say on it does just as well—better in fact.
The by-product, the Neo-Marxian theory of modern protectionism,
still remains. Classical literature is full of invectives against the
“sinister interests”—at that time mainly, but never wholly, the agrarian
interests—which in clamoring for protection committed the
unforgivable crime against public welfare. Thus the classics had a
causal theory of protection all right—not only a theory of its effects—
and if now we add the protectionist interests of modern big business we
have gone as far as it is reasonable to go. Modern economists with
Marxist sympathies really should know better than to say that even now
their bourgeois colleagues do not see the relation between the trend
toward protectionism and the trend toward big units of control, though
these colleagues may not always think it necessary to stress so obvious
a fact. Not that the classics and their successors to this day were right
about protection: their interpretation of it was, and is, as one-sided as
was the Marxian one, besides being often wrong in the appraisal of
consequences and of the interests involved. But for at least fifty years
they have known about the monopoly component in protectionism all
that Marxists ever knew, which was not difficult considering the
commonplace character of the discovery.
And they were superior to the Marxist theory in one very important
respect. Whatever the value of their economics—perhaps it was not great—
they mostly 6 stuck to it. In this instance, that was an advantage. The
proposition that many protective duties owe their existence to the pressure
of large concerns that desire to use them for the purpose of keeping their
prices at home above what they otherwise would be, possibly in order to be
able to sell more cheaply abroad, is a platitude but correct, although no tariff
was ever wholly or even mainly due to this particular cause. It is the Marxian
synthesis that makes it inadequate or wrong. If our ambition is simply to
understand all the causes and implications of modern protectionism, political,
6 They did not always confine themselves to their economics. When they did not,
results were anything but encouraging. Thus, James Mill’s purely economic writings,
while not particularly valuable, cannot be simply dismissed as hopelessly substandard.
The real nonsense—and platitudinous nonsense at that—is in his articles on government
and cognate subjects.
Marx the Teacher 55
social and economic, then it is inadequate. For instance, the consistent
support given by the American people to protectionist policy, whenever they
had the opportunity to speak their minds, is accounted for not by any love
for or domination by big business, but by a fervent wish to build and keep
a world of their own and to be rid of all the vicissitudes of the rest of the
world. Synthesis that overlooks such elements of the case is not an asset but
a liability. But if our ambition is to reduce all the causes and implications
of modern protectionism, whatever they may be, to the monopolistic element
in modern industry as the sole causa causans and if we formulate that
proposition accordingly, then it becomes wrong. Big business has been able
to take advantage of the popular sentiment and it has fostered it; but it is
absurd to say that it has created it. Synthesis that yields—we ought rather
to say, postulates—such a result is inferior to no synthesis at all.
Matters become infinitely worse if, flying in the face of fact plus common
sense, we exalt that theory of capital export and colonization into the
fundamental explanation of international politics which thereupon resolves
into a struggle, on the one hand, of monopolistic capitalist groups with each
other and, on the other hand, of each of them with their own proletariat. This
sort of thing may make useful party literature but otherwise it merely shows
that nursery tales are no monopoly of bourgeois economics. As a matter of
fact, very little influence on foreign policy has been exerted by big
business—or by the haute finance from the Fuggers to the Morgans—and
in most of the cases in which large-scale industry as such, or banking
interests as such, have been able to assert themselves, their naïve dilettantism
has resulted in discomfiture. The attitudes of capitalist groups toward the
policy of their nations are predominantly adaptive rather than causative,
today more than ever. Also, they hinge to an astonishing degree on short-
run considerations equally remote from any deeply laid plans and from any
definite “objective” class interests. At this point Marxism degenerates into
the formulation of popular superstitions. 7
There are other instances of a similar state of things in all parts of the
Marxian structure. To mention one, the definition of the nature of governments
that was quoted from the Communist Manifesto a little while ago has certainly
7 This superstition is exactly on a par with another that is harbored by many worthy and
simple-minded people who explain modern history to themselves on the hypothesis that there
is somewhere a committee of supremely wise and malevolent Jews who behind the scenes
control international or perhaps all politics. Marxists are not victims of this particular
superstition but theirs is on no higher plane. It is amusing to record that, when faced with either
doctrine, I have always experienced great difficulty in replying in anything like a fashion
satisfactory to myself. This was not only due to the circumstance that it is always difficult to
establish denial of factual assertions. The main difficulty came from the fact that people, lacking
any first-hand knowledge of international affairs and their personnel, also lack any organ for
the perception of absurdity.
The Marxian Doctrine56
an element of truth in it. And in many cases that truth will account for
governmental attitudes toward the more obvious manifestations of class
antagonisms. But so far as true, the theory embodied in that definition is trivial.
All that is worth while troubling about is the Why and How of that vast
majority of cases in which the theory either fails to conform to fact or, even
if conforming, fails to describe correctly the actual behavior of those
“committees for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie.” Again, in
practically all cases the theory can be made tautologically true. For there is
no policy short of exterminating the bourgeoisie that could not be held to serve
some economic or extra-economic, short-run or long-run, bourgeois interest,
at least in the sense that it wards off still worse things. This, however, does
not make that theory any more valuable. But let us turn to our second example
of the problem-solving power of the Marxian synthesis.
The badge of Scientific Socialism which according to Marx is to distinguish
it from Utopian Socialism consists in the proof that socialism is inevitable
irrespective of human volition or of desirability. As has been stated before, all
this means is that by virtue of its very logic capitalist evolution tends to destroy
the capitalist and to produce the socialist order of things. 8 How far has Marx
succeeded in establishing the existence of these tendencies?
As regards the tendency toward self-destruction, the question has
already been answered. 9 The doctrine that the capitalist economy will
inevitably break down for purely economic reasons has not been
established by Marx, as Hilferding’s objections would suffice to show.
On the one hand, some of his propositions about future facts that are
essential to the orthodox argument, especially the one about the
inevitable increase of misery and oppression, are untenable; on the other
hand, the breakdown of the capitalist order would not necessarily follow
from these propositions, even if they were all true. But other factors in
the situation that the capitalist process tends to develop were correctly
seen by Marx, as was, so I hope to show, the ultimate outcome itself.
Concerning the latter, it may be necessary to replace the Marxian nexus
by another, and the term “breakdown” may then turn out to be a
misnomer, particularly if it be understood in the sense of a breakdown
caused by the failure of the capitalist engine of production; but this does
not affect the essence of the doctrine, however much it may affect its
formulation and some of its implications.
As regards the tendency toward socialism, we must first realize that this
is a distinct problem. The capitalist or any other order of things may
evidently break down—or economic and social evolution may outgrow it—
8 See also Part II, Prologue
9 See supra, ch. iii, § 7.
Marx the Teacher 57
and yet the socialist phoenix may fail to rise from the ashes. There may be
chaos and, unless we define as socialism any non-chaotic alternative to
capitalism, there are other possibilities. The particular type of social
organization that the average orthodox Marxist—before the advent of
bolshevism at any rate—seemed to anticipate is certainly only one of many
possible cases.
Marx himself, while very wisely refraining from describing socialist
society in detail, emphasized conditions of its emergence: on the one hand,
the presence of giant units of industrial control—which, of course, would
greatly facilitate socialization—and, on the other hand, the presence of an
oppressed, enslaved, exploited, but also very numerous, disciplined, united
and organized proletariat. This suggests much about the final battle that is
to be the acute stage of the secular warfare between the two classes which
will then be arrayed against each other for the last time. It also suggests
something about what is to follow; it suggests the idea that the proletariat
as such will “take over” and, through its dictatorship, put a stop to the
“exploitation of man by man” and bring about classless society. If our
purpose were to prove that Marxism is a member of the family of chiliastic
creeds this would indeed be quite enough. Since we are concerned not with
that aspect but with a scientific forecast, it clearly is not. Schmoller was on
much safer ground. For though he also refused to commit himself to details,
he obviously visualized the process as one of progressive bureaucratization,
nationalization and so on, ending in state socialism which, whether we like
it or not, at least makes definite sense. Thus Marx fails to turn the socialist
possibility into a certainty even if we grant him the breakdown theory in its
entirety; if we do not, then failure follows a fortiori.
In no case, however—whether we accept Marx’s reasoning or any other—
will the socialist order be realized automatically; even if capitalist evolution
provided all conditions for it in the most Marxian manner conceivable,
distinct action would still be necessary to bring it about. 10 This of course is
in accordance with Marx’s teaching. His revolution is but the particular garb
in which his imagination liked to clothe that action. The emphasis on
violence is perhaps understandable in one who in his formative years had
experienced all the excitement of 1848 and who was, though quite able to
despise revolutionary ideology, yet never able to shake off its trammels.
Moreover, the greater part of his audience would hardly have been willing
to listen to a message that lacked the hallowed clarion call. Finally, though
he saw the possibility of peaceful transition, at least for England, he may
not have seen its likelihood. In his day it was not so easy to see, and his pet
10 See Part III, ch. v.
The Marxian Doctrine58
idea of the two classes in battle array made it still more difficult to see it.
His friend Engels actually went to the trouble of studying tactics. But though
the revolution can be relegated to the compound of non-essentials, the
necessity for distinct action still remains.
This should also solve the problem that has divided the disciples:
revolution or evolution? If I have caught Marx’s meaning, the answer is not
hard to give. Evolution was for him the parent of socialism. He was much
too strongly imbued with a sense of the inherent logic of things social to
believe that revolution can replace any part of the work of evolution. The
revolution comes in nevertheless. But it only comes in order to write the
conclusion under a complete set of premises. The Marxian revolution
therefore differs entirely, in nature and in function, from the revolutions both
of the bourgeois radical and of the socialist conspirator. It is essentially
revolution in the fullness of time.11 It is true that disciples who dislike this
conclusion, and especially its application to the Russian case, 12 can point to
many passages in the sacred books that seem to contradict it. But in those
passages Marx himself contradicts his deepest and most mature thought
which speaks out unmistakably from the analytic structure of Das Kapital
and—as any thought must that is inspired by a sense of the inherent logic
of things—carries, beneath the fantastic glitter of dubious gems, a distinctly
conservative implication. And, after all, why not? No serious argument ever
supports any “ism” un-conditionally. 13 To say that Marx, stripped of phrases,
admits of interpretation in a conservative sense is only saying that he can
be taken seriously.
11 This should be noticed for later reference. We shall repeatedly return to the subject and,
among other things, discuss the criteria of that “fullness of time.”
12 Karl Kautsky, in his preface to Theorien über den Mehrwert, even claimed the revolution
of 1905 for Marxian socialism, although it is patent that the Marxian phraseology of a few
intellectuals was all that was socialist about it.
13 This argument could be carried much further. In particular, there is nothing specifically
socialist in the labor theory of value; this of course everyone would admit who is familiar with
the historical development of that doctrine. But the same is true (excepting of course the phrase)
of the theory of exploitation. We need only recognize that existence of the surpluses so dubbed
by Marx is—or at least was—a necessary condition for the emergence of all that we comprise
in the term civilization (which in fact it would be difficult to deny), and there we are. In order
to be a socialist, it is of course not necessary to be a Marxist; but neither is it sufficient to be
a Marxist in order to be a socialist. Socialist or revolutionary conclusions can be impressed on
any scientific theory; no scientific theory necessarily implies them. And none will keep us in
what Bernard Shaw somewhere describes as sociological rage, unless its author goes out of his
way in order to work us up.
PART II
Can Capitalism Survive?

61
PROLOGUE
C AN capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can. But this opinion of
mine, like that of every other economist who has pronounced upon the
subject, is in itself completely uninteresting. What counts in any attempt at
social prognosis is not the Yes or No that sums up the facts and arguments
which lead up to it but those facts and arguments themselves. They contain
all that is scientific in the final result. Everything else is not science but
prophecy. Analysis, whether economic or other, never yields more than a
statement about the tendencies present in an observable pattern. And these
never tell us what will happen to the pattern but only what would happen if
they continued to act as they have been acting in the time interval covered
by our observation and if no other factors intruded. “Inevitability” or
“necessity” can never mean more than this.
What follows must be read with that proviso. But there are other
limitations to our results and their reliability. The process of social life is
a function of so many variables many of which are not amenable to
anything like measurement that even mere diagnosis of a given state of
things becomes a doubtful matter quite apart from the formidable sources
of error that open up as soon as we attempt prognosis. These difficulties
should not be exaggerated, however. We shall see that the dominant traits
of the picture clearly support certain inferences which, whatever the
qualifications that may have to be added, are too strong to be neglected
on the ground that they cannot be proved in the sense in which a
proposition of Euclid’s can.
One more point before we start. The thesis I shall endeavor to establish
is that the actual and prospective performance of the capitalist system is
such as to negative the idea of its breaking down under the weight of
economic failure, but that its very success undermines the social
institutions which protect it, and “inevitably” creates conditions in which
it will not be able to live and which strongly point to socialism as the heir
apparent. My final conclusion therefore does not differ, however much my
argument may, from that of most socialist writers and in particular from
that of all Marxists. But in order to accept it one does not need to be a
socialist. Prognosis does not imply anything about the desirability of the
course of events that one predicts. If a doctor predicts that his patient will
die presently, this does not mean that he desires it. One may hate socialism
Can Capitalism Survive?62
or at least look upon it with cool criticism, and yet foresee its advent. Many
conservatives did and do.
Nor need one accept this conclusion in order to qualify as a socialist. One
may love socialism and ardently believe in its economic, cultural and ethical
superiority but nevertheless believe at the same time that capitalist society
does not harbor any tendency toward self-destruction. There are in fact
socialists who believe that the capitalist order is gathering strength and is
entrenching itself as time goes on, so that it is chimerical to hope for its
breakdown.

THE RATE OF INCREASE OF TOTAL OUTPUT
T HE atmosphere of hostility to capitalism which we shall have to explain
presently makes it much more difficult than it otherwise would be to
form a rational opinion about its economic and cultural performance. The
public mind has by now so thoroughly grown out of humor with it as to
make condemnation of capitalism and all its works a foregone conclusion—
almost a requirement of the etiquette of discussion. Whatever his political
preference, every writer or speaker hastens to conform to this code and to
emphasize his critical attitude, his freedom from “complacency,” his belief
in the inadequacies of capitalist achievement, his aversion to capitalist and
his sympathy with anti-capitalist interests. Any other attitude is voted not
only foolish but anti-social and is looked upon as an indication of immoral
servitude. This is of course perfectly natural. New social religions will
always have that effect. Only it does not make it easier to fulfill the analyst’s
task: in 300 A.D. it would not have been easy to expound the achievements
of ancient civilization to a fervent believer in Christianity. On the one hand,
the most obvious truths are simply put out of court a limine;1 on the other
hand, the most obvious misstatements are borne with or applauded.
A first test of economic performance is total output, the total of all the
commodities and services produced in a unit of time—a year or a quarter
of a year or a month. Economists try to measure variations in this quantity
by means of indices derived from a number of series representing the output
of individual commodities. “Strict logic is a stern master, and if one
respected it, one would never construct or use any production index,” 2 for
not only the material and the technique of constructing such an index, but
the very concept of a total output of different commodities produced in ever-
changing proportions, is a highly doubtful matter. 3 Nevertheless, I believe
that this device is sufficiently reliable to give us a general idea.
1 There is however another method of dealing with obvious though uncomfortable truth, viz.,
the method of sneering at its triviality. Such a sneer will serve as well as a refutation would,
for the average audience is as a rule perfectly unaware of the fact that it often covers the
impossibility of denial—a pretty specimen of social psychology.

3 We cannot enter into this problem here. A little will, however, be said about it when
we meet it again in the next chapter. For a fuller treatment see my book on Business
Cycles, ch. ix.
Can Capitalism Survive?64
For the United States, individual series good and numerous enough to
warrant construction of such an index of output are available since the Civil
War. Choosing what is known as the Day-Persons index of total production 4
we find that, from 1870 to 1930, the average annual rate of growth was 3.7
per cent and, in the division of manufactures alone, 4.3 per cent. Let us
concentrate on the former figure and try to visualize what it means. In order
to do this we must first apply a correction: since the durable equipment of
industry was always increasing in relative importance, output available for
consumption cannot have increased at the same rate as total production. We
must allow for that. But I believe that an allowance of 1.7 per cent is ample; 5
thus we arrive at a rate of increase in “available output” of 2 per cent
(compound interest) per year.
Now suppose that the capitalist engine keeps on producing at that rate of
increase for another half century starting from 1928. To this assumption there
are various objections which will have to be noticed later on, but it cannot
be objected to on the ground that in the decade from 1929 to 1939 capitalism
had already failed to live up to that standard. For the depression that ran its
course from the last quarter of 1929 to the third quarter of 1932 does not
prove that a secular break has occurred in the propelling mechanism of
capitalist production because depressions of such severity have repeatedly
occurred—roughly once in fifty-five years—and because the effects of one
of them—the one from 1873 to 1877—are taken account of in the annual
average of 2 per cent. The subnormal recovery to 1935, the subnormal
prosperity to 1937 and the slump after that are easily accounted for by the
difficulties incident to the adaptation to a new fiscal policy, new labor
legislation and a general change in the attitude of government to private
enterprise all of which can, in a sense to be defined later, be distinguished
from the working of the productive apparatus as such.
Since misunderstandings at this point would be especially undesirable, I
wish to emphasize that the last sentence does not in itself imply either an
adverse criticism of the New Deal policies or the proposition—which I do
believe to be true but which I do not need just now—that policies of that
type are in the long run incompatible with the effective working of the
system of private enterprise. All I now mean to imply is that so extensive
and rapid a change of the social scene naturally affects productive
performance for a time, and so much the most ardent New Dealer must and
also can admit. I for one do not see how it would otherwise be possible to
4 See W.M.Persons, Forecasting Business Cycles, ch. xi.
5 That allowance is in fact absurdly large. See also Professor F.C.Mill’s estimate of 3.1 per
cent for the period 1901–1913, and of 3.8 per cent for the period 1922–1929 (construction
excluded; Economic Tendencies in the United States, 1932).
The Rate of Increse of Total Output 65
account for the fact that this country which had the best chance of recovering
quickly was precisely the one to experience the most unsatisfactory recovery.
The only somewhat similar case, that of France, supports the same inference.
It follows that the course of events during the decade from 1929 to 1939 does
not per se constitute a valid reason for refusing to listen to the argument in
hand which, moreover, may in any case serve to illustrate the meaning of
past performance.
Well, if from 1928 on available production under the conditions of the
capitalist order continued to develop as it did before, i.e., at a long-run
average rate of increase of 2 per cent per year, it would after fifty years,
in 1978, reach an amount of roughly 2.7 (2.6916) times the 1928 figure.
In order to translate this into terms of average real income per head of
population, we first observe that our rate of increase in total output may
be roughly equated to the rate of increase in the sum total of private money
incomes available for consumption, 6 corrected for changes in the
purchasing power of the consumers’ dollars. Second, we must form an idea
about the increase in population we are to expect; we will choose Mr.
Sloane’s estimate, which gives 160 millions for 1978. Average income per
head during those fifty years would therefore increase to a little more than
double its 1928 amount, which was about $650, or to about $1300 of 1928
purchasing power. 7
Perhaps some readers feel that a proviso should be added about the
distribution of the total monetary income. Until about forty years ago,
many economists besides Marx believed that the capitalist process tended
to change relative shares in the national total so that the obvious
inference from our average might be invalidated by the rich growing
richer and the poor growing poorer, at least relatively. But there is no
such tendency. Whatever may be thought of the statistical measures
devised for the purpose, this much is certain: that the structure of the
pyramid of incomes, expressed in terms of money, has not greatly
changed during the period covered by our material—which for England
6 “Consumption” includes the acquisition of durable consumers’ goods such as motor cars,
refrigerators and homes. We do not distinguish between transient consumers’ goods and what
is sometimes referred to as “consumers’ capital.”
7 That is to say, average real income per head would increase at a compound interest rate
of 1? per cent. It so happens that in England, during the century preceding the First World War,
real income per head of population increased at almost exactly that rate (see Lord Stamp in
Wealth and Taxable Capacity). No great confidence can be placed in this coincidence. But I
think it serves to show that our little calculation is not wildly absurd. In Number 241 of the
National Industrial Conference Board Studies, Table I, pp. 6 and 7, we find that “per capita
realized national income” adjusted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the National
Industrial Conference Board cost of living index, was in 1929 a little over four times the 1829
figure—a similar result, though open to still more serious doubts as to reliability.
Can Capitalism Survive?66
includes the whole of the nineteenth century 8 —and that the relative share
of wages plus salaries has also been substantially constant over time.
There is, so long as we are discussing what the capitalist engine might
do if left to itself, no reason to believe that the distribution of incomes
or the dispersion about our average would in 1978 be significantly
different from what it was in 1928.
One way of expressing our result is that, if capitalism repeated its past
performance for another half century starting with 1928, this would do away
with anything that according to present standards could be called poverty,
even in the lowest strata of the population, pathological cases alone excepted.
Nor is this all. Whatever else our index may do or may not do, it
certainly does not overstate the actual rate of increase. It does not take
account of the commodity, Voluntary Leisure. New commodities escape
or are inadequately represented by an index which must rest largely on
basic commodities and intermediate products. For the same reason
improvements in quality almost completely fail to assert themselves
although they constitute, in many lines, the core of the progress
achieved—there is no way of expressing adequately the difference
between a motorcar of 1940 and a motorcar of 1900 or the extent to
which the price of motorcars per unit of utility has fallen. It would be
more nearly possible to estimate the rate at which given quantities of
raw materials or semi-finished products are made to go further than
they used to—a steel ingot or a ton of coal, though they may be
unchanged in physical quality, represent a multiple of their economic
efficiency sixty years ago. But little has been done along this line. I
have no idea about what would happen to our index if there were a
method for correcting it for these and similar factors. It is certain,
however, that its percentage rate of change would be increased and that
we have here a reserve that should make the estimate adopted proof
against the effects of any conceivable downward revision. Moreover,
even if we had the means of measuring the change in the technological
efficiency of industrial products, this measure would still fail to convey
an adequate idea of what it means for the dignity or intensity or
pleasantness of human life—for all that the economists of an earlier
generation subsumed under the heading of Satisfaction of Wants. And
this, after all, is for us the relevant consideration, the true “output” of
8 See Stamp, op. cit. The same phenomenon can be observed in all countries for which there
is sufficient statistical information, if we clear the latter of the disturbing effect of the cycles
of various span that are covered by the available material. The measure of income distribution
(or of inequality of incomes) devised by Vilfredo Pareto is open to objection. But the fact itself
is independent of its shortcomings.
The Rate of Increse of Total Output 67
capitalist production, the reason why we are interested in the index of
production and the pounds and gallons that enter into it and would
hardly be worth while in themselves.
But let us keep to our 2 per cent. There is one more point that is
important for a correct appraisal of that figure. I have stated above that,
broadly speaking, relative shares in national income have remained
substantially constant over the last hundred years. This, however, is true
only if we measure them in money. Measured in real terms, relative shares
have substantially changed in favor of the lower income groups. This
follows from the fact that the capitalist engine is first and last an engine
of mass production which unavoidably means also production for the
masses, whereas, climbing upward in the scale of individual incomes, we
find that an increasing proportion is being spent on personal services and
on handmade commodities, the prices of which are largely a function of
wage rates.
Verification is easy. There are no doubt some things available to the
modern workman that Louis XIV himself would have been delighted to
have yet was unable to have—modern dentistry for instance. On the whole,
however, a budget on that level had little that really mattered to gain from
capitalist achievement. Even speed of traveling may be assumed to have
been a minor consideration for so very dignified a gentleman. Electric
lighting is no great boon to anyone who has money enough to buy a
sufficient number of candles and to pay servants to attend to them. It is
the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and
so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as
a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen
Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not
typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in
bringing them within the reach of factory girls in return for steadily
decreasing amounts of effort.
The same fact stands out still better if we glance at those long waves in
economic activity, analysis of which reveals the nature and mechanism of
the capitalist process better than anything else. Each of them consists of an
“industrial revolution” and the absorption of its effects. For instance, we are
able to observe statistically and historically—the phenomenon is so clear that
even our scanty information suffices to establish it—the rise of such a long
wave toward the end of the 1780’s, its culmination around 1800, its
downward sweep and then a sort of recovery ending at the beginning of the
1840’s. This was the Industrial Revolution dear to the heart of textbook
writers. Upon its heels, however, came another such revolution producing
another long wave that rose in the forties, culminated just before 1857 and
Can Capitalism Survive?68
ebbed away to 1897, to be followed in turn by the one that reached its peak
about 1911 and is now in the act of ebbing away. 9
These revolutions periodically reshape the existing structure of industry
by introducing new methods of production—the mechanized factory, the
electrified factory, chemical synthesis and the like; new commodities, such
as railroad service, motorcars, electrical appliances; new forms of
organization—the merger movement; new sources of supply—La Plata wool,
American cotton, Katanga copper; new trade routes and markets to sell in
and so on. This process of industrial change provides the ground swell that
gives the general tone to business: while these things are being initiated we
have brisk expenditure and predominating “prosperity”—interrupted, no
doubt, by the negative phases of the shorter cycles that are superimposed on
that ground swell—and while those things are being completed and their
results pour forth we have elimination of antiquated elements of the
industrial structure and predominating “depression.” Thus there are
prolonged periods of rising and of falling prices, interest rates, employment
and so on, which phenomena constitute parts of the mechanism of this
process of recurrent rejuvenation of the productive apparatus.
Now these results each time consist in an avalanche of consumers’ goods
that permanently deepens and widens the stream of real income although in
the first instance they spell disturbance, losses and unemployment. And if
we look at those avalanches of consumers’ goods we again find that each
of them consists in articles of mass consumption and increases the
purchasing power of the wage dollar more than that of any other dollar—in
other words, that the capitalist process, not by coincidence but by virtue of
its mechanism, progressively raises the standard of life of the masses. It does
so through a sequence: of vicissitudes, the severity of which is proportional
to the speed of the advance. But it does so effectively. One problem after
another of the supply of commodities to the masses has been successfully
solved 10 by being brought within the reach of the methods of capitalist
production. The most important one of those that remain, housing, is
approaching solution by means of the pre-fabricated house.
And still this is not all. Appraisal of an economic order would be
incomplete—and incidentally un-Marxian—if it stopped at the output which
the corresponding economic conveyor hands to the various groups of society
and left out of account all those things that the conveyor does not serve
9 These are the “long waves” which, in business cycle literature, are primarily associated
with the name of N.D.Kondratieff.
10 This of course also applies to agricultural commodities, the cheap mass production of
which was entirely the work of large-scale capitalist enterprise (railroads, shipping, agricultural
machinery, fertilizers).
The Rate of Increse of Total Output 69
directly but for which it provides the means as well as the political volition,
and all those cultural achievements that are induced by the mentality it
generates. Deferring consideration of the latter (Chapter XI), we shall now
turn to some aspects of the former.
The technique and atmosphere of the struggle for social legislation
obscures the otherwise obvious facts that, on the one hand, part of this
legislation presupposes previous capitalist success (in other words, wealth
which had previously to be created by capitalist enterprise) and that, on
the other hand, much of what social legislation develops and generalizes
had been previously initiated by the action of the capitalist stratum itself.
Both facts must of course be added to the sum total of capitalist
performance. Now if the system had another run such as it had in the
sixty years preceding 1928 and really reached the $1300 per head of
population, it is easy to see that all the desiderata that have so far been
espoused by any social reformers—practically without exception,
including even the greater part of the cranks—either would be fulfilled
automatically or could be fulfilled without significant interference with
the capitalist process. Ample provision for the unemployed in particular
would then be not only a tolerable but a light burden. Irresponsibility in
creating unemployment and in financing the support of the unemployed
might of course at any time create insoluble problems. But managed with
ordinary prudence, an average annual expenditure of 16 billions on an
average number of 16 million unemployed including dependents (10 per
cent of the population) would not in itself be a serious matter with an
available national income of the order of magnitude of 200 billion dollars
(purchasing power of 1928).
May I call the reader’s attention to the reason why unemployment which
everyone agrees must be one of the most important issues in any discussion
of capitalism—with some critics so much so that they base their indictment
exclusively on this element of the case—will play a comparatively small
role in my argument? I do not think that unemployment is among those
evils which, like poverty, capitalist evolution could ever eliminate of itself.
I also do not think that there is any tendency for the unemployment
percentage to increase in the long run. The only series covering a
respectable time interval—roughly the sixty years preceding the First
World War—gives the English trade-union percentage of unemployed
members. It is a typically cyclical series and displays no trend (or a
11 That series has often been charted and analyzed. See for instance, A.C.Pigou. Industrial
Fluctuations or my Business Cycles. For every country there seems to be an irreducible
minimum and, superimposed on that, a cyclical movement, the strongest component of which
has a period of about nine to ten years.
Can Capitalism Survive?70
horizontal one). 11 Since this is theoretically understandable—there is no
theoretical reason to call the evidence in question—those two propositions
seem established for the prewar time to 1913 inclusive. In the postwar time
and in most countries unemployment was mostly at an abnormally high
level even before 1930. But this and still more the unemployment during
the thirties can be accounted for on grounds that have nothing to do with
a long-run tendency of unemployment percentages to increase from causes
inherent in the capitalist mechanism itself. I have mentioned above those
industrial revolutions which are so characteristic of the capitalist process.
Supernormal unemployment is one of the features of the periods of
adaptation that follow upon the “prosperity phase” of each of them. We
observe it in the 1820’s and 1870’s, and the period after 1920 is simply
another of those periods. So far the phenomenon is essentially temporary
in the sense that nothing can be inferred about it for the future. But there
were a number of other factors which tended to intensify it—war effects,
dislocations of foreign trade, wage policies, certain institutional changes
that swelled the statistical figure, in England and Germany fiscal policies
(also important in the United States since 1935) and so on. Some of these
are no doubt symptoms of an “atmosphere” in which capitalism will work
with decreasing efficiency. That however is another matter which will
engage our attention later on.
But whether lasting or temporary, getting worse or not, unemployment
undoubtedly is and always has been a scourge. In the next part of this book
we shall have to list its possible elimination among the claims of the
socialist order to superiority. Nevertheless, I hold that the real tragedy is
not unemployment per se, but unemployment plus the impossibility of
providing adequately for the unemployed without impairing the conditions
of further economic development: for obviously the suffering and
degradation—the destruction of human values—which we associate with
unemployment, though not the waste of productive resources, would be
largely eliminated and unemployment would lose practically all its terror
if the private life of the unemployed were not seriously affected by their
unemployment. The indictment stands that in the past—say, roughly, to the
end of the nineteenth century—the capitalist order was not only unwilling
but also quite incapable of guaranteeing this. But since it will be able to
do so if it keeps up its past performance for another half century this
indictment would in that case enter the limbo filled by the sorry specters
of child labor and sixteen-hour working days and five persons living in one
room which it is quite proper to emphasize when we are talking about the
past social costs of capitalist achievement but which are not necessarily
relevant to the balance of alternatives for the future. Our own time is
The Rate of Increse of Total Output 71
somewhere between the disabilities of earlier stages in capitalist evolution
and the abilities of the system in full maturity. In this country at least, the
better part of the task could even now be accomplished without undue
strain on the system. The difficulties do not seem to consist so much in
the lack of a surplus sufficient to blot out the darkest hues in the picture:
they consist, on the one hand, in the fact that the unemployment figure has
been increased by anti-capitalist policies beyond what it need have been
in the thirties and, on the other hand, in the fact that public opinion as soon
as it becomes at all alive to the duty in question, immediately insists on
economically irrational methods of financing relief and on lax and wasteful
methods of administering it.
Much the same argument applies to the future—and to a great extent the
present—possibilities held out by capitalist evolution for the care of the aged
and sick, for education and hygiene and so on. Also, an increasing number
of commodities might reasonably be expected, from the standpoint of the
individual household, to pass out of the class of economic goods and to be
available practically up to the satiety point. This could be brought about
either by arrangements between public agencies and producing concerns or
by nationalization or municipalization, gradual progress with which would
of course be a feature of the future development even of an otherwise
unfettered capitalism.
72
CHAPTER VI
PLAUSIBLE CAPITALISM
T HE argument of the preceding chapter seems to be exposed to a reply
that is as damaging as it is obvious. The average rate of increase in total
available production that obtained during the sixty years preceding 1928 has
been projected into the future. So far as this was merely a device in order
to illustrate the significance of past development, there was nothing in this
procedure that could have shocked the statistical conscience. But as soon as
I implied that the following fifty years might actually display a similar
average rate of increase, I apparently did commit a statistical crime; it is, of
course, clear that a historical record of production over any given period does
not in itself justify any extrapolation at all,1 let alone an extrapolation over
half a century. It is therefore necessary to emphasize again that my
extrapolation is not intended to forecast the actual behavior of output in the
future. Beyond illustrating the meaning of past performance, it is merely
intended to give us a quantitative idea of what the capitalist engine might
conceivably accomplish if, for another half century, it repeated its past
performance—which is a very different matter. The question whether it can
be expected to do so will be answered quite independently of the
extrapolation itself. For this purpose we have now to embark upon a long
and difficult investigation.
Before we can discuss the chance of capitalism repeating its past
performance we must evidently try to find out in what sense the observed
rate of increase in output really measures that past performance. No doubt,
the period that furnished our data was one of comparatively unfettered
capitalism. But this fact does not in itself provide a sufficient link between
the performance and the capitalist engine. In order to believe that this was
more than coincidence we must satisfy ourselves first, that there is an
understandable relation between the capitalist order and the observed rate of
increase in output; second, that, given such a relation, the rate of increase
1 This proposition holds, on general principles, for any historical time series, since the very
concept of historical sequence implies the occurrence of irreversible changes in the economic
structure which must be expected to affect the law of any given economic quantity. Theoretical
justification and, as a rule, statistical treatment are therefore necessary for even the most modest
extrapolations. It may however be urged that our case is somewhat favored by the fact that
within the comprehensive compound represented by the output series, idiosyncrasies of
individual items will to some extent cancel each other.
Plausible Capitalism 73
was actually due to it and not to particularly favorable conditions which had
nothing to do with capitalism.
These two problems must be solved before the problem of a “repetition
of performance” can arise at all. The third point then reduces to the question
whether there is any reason why the capitalist engine should, during the next
forty years, fail to go on working as it did in the past.
We shall deal with these three points in turn.
Our first problem may be reformulated as follows. On the one hand, we
have a considerable body of statistical data descriptive of a rate of
“progress” that has been admired even by very critical minds. On the other
hand, we have a body of facts about the structure of the economic system
of that period and about the way it functioned; from these facts, analysis
has distilled what is technically called a “model” of capitalist reality, i.e.,
a generalized picture of its essential features. We wish to know whether
that type of economy was favorable, irrelevant, or unfavorable to the
performance we observe and, if favorable, whether those features may be
reasonably held to yield adequate explanation of this performance. Waiving
technicalities as much as possible, we shall approach the question in a
common-sense spirit.
1. Unlike the class of feudal lords, the commercial and industrial
bourgeoisie rose by business success. Bourgeois society has been cast in a
purely economic mold: its foundations, beams and beacons are all made of
economic material. The building faces toward the economic side of life. Prizes
and penalties are measured in pecuniary terms. Going up and going down
means making and losing money. This, of course, nobody can deny. But I wish
to add that, within its own frame, that social arrangement is, or at all events
was, singularly effective. In part it appeals to, and in part it creates, a schema
of motives that is unsurpassed in simplicity and force. The promises of wealth
and the threats of destitution that it holds out, it redeems with ruthless
promptitude. Wherever the bourgeois way of life asserts itself sufficiently to
dim the beacons of other social worlds, these promises are strong enough to
attract the large majority of supernormal brains and to identify success with
business success. They are not proffered at random; yet there is a sufficiently
enticing admixture of chance: the game is not like roulette, it is more like
poker. They are addressed to ability, energy and supernormal capacity for
work; but if there were a way of measuring either that ability in general or
the personal achievement that goes into any particular success, the premiums
actually paid out would probably not be found proportional to either.
Spectacular prizes much greater than would have been necessary to call forth
the particular effort are thrown to a small minority of winners, thus propelling
much more efficaciously than a more equal and more “just” distribution would,
Can Capitalism Survive?74
the activity of that large majority of businessmen who receive in return very
modest compensation or nothing or less than nothing, and yet do their utmost
because they have the big prizes before their eyes and overrate their chances
of doing equally well. Similarly, the threats are addressed to incompetence. But
though the incompetent men and the obsolete methods are in fact eliminated,
sometimes very promptly, sometimes with a lag, failure also threatens or
actually overtakes many an able man, thus whipping up everyone, again much
more efficaciously than a more equal and more “just” system of penalties
would. Finally, both business success and business failure are ideally precise.
Neither can be talked away.
One aspect of this should be particularly noticed, for future reference
as well as because of its importance for the argument in hand. In the way
indicated and also in other ways which will be discussed later on, the
capitalist arrangement, as embodied in the institution of private
enterprise, effectively chains the bourgeois stratum to its tasks. But it
does more than that. The same apparatus which conditions for
performance the individuals and families that at any given time form the
bourgeois class, ipso facto also selects the individuals and families that
are to rise into that class or to drop out of it. This combination of the
conditioning and the selective function is not a matter of course. On the
contrary, most methods of social selection, unlike the “methods” of
biological selection, do not guarantee performance of the selected
individual; and their failure to do so constitutes one of the crucial
problems of socialist organization that will come up for discussion at
another stage of our inquiry. For the time being, it should merely be
observed how well the capitalist system solves that problem: in most
cases the man who rises first into the business class and then within it is
also an able businessman and he is likely to rise exactly as far as his
ability goes—simply because in that schema rising to a position and
doing well in it generally is or was one and the same thing. This fact, so
often obscured by the auto-therapeutic effort of the unsuccessful to deny
it, is much more important for an appraisal of capitalist society and its
civilization than anything that can be gleaned from the pure theory of the
capitalist machine.
2. But is not all that we might be tempted to infer from “maximum
performance of an optimally selected group” invalidated by the further fact that
that performance is not geared to social service—production, so we might say,
for consumption—but to money-making, that it aims at maximizing profits
instead of welfare? Outside of the bourgeois stratum, this has of course always
been the popular opinion. Economists have sometimes fought and sometimes
espoused it. In doing so they have contributed something that was much more
Plausible Capitalism 75
valuable than were the final judgments themselves at which they arrived
individually and which in most cases reflect little more than their social
location, interests and sympathies or antipathies. They slowly increased our
factual knowledge and analytic powers so that the answers to many questions
we are able to give today are no doubt much more correct although less simple
and sweeping than were those of our predecessors.
To go no further back, the so-called classical economists2 were practically
of one mind. Most of them disliked many things about the social institutions
of their epoch and about the way those institu tions worked. They fought the
landed interest and approved of social reforms—factory legislation in
particular—that were not all on the lines of laissez faire. But they were quite
convinced that within the institutional framework of capitalism, the
manufacturer’s and the trader’s self-interest made for maximum performance
in the interest of all. Confronted with the problem we are discussing, they
would have had little hesitation in attributing the observed rate of increase
in total output to relatively unfettered enterprise and the profit motive—
perhaps they would have mentioned “beneficial legislation” as a condition
but by this they would have meant the removal of fetters, especially the
removal or reduction of protective duties during the nineteenth century.
It is exceedingly difficult, at this hour of the day, to do justice to these
views. They were of course the typical views of the English bourgeois class,
and bourgeois blinkers are in evidence on almost every page the classical
authors wrote. No less in evidence are blinkers of another kind: the classics
reasoned in terms of a particular historical situation which they uncritically
idealized and from which they uncritically generalized. Most of them,
moreover, seem to have argued exclusively in terms of the English interests
and problems of their time. This is the reason why, in other lands and at other
times, people disliked their economics, frequently to the point of not even
caring to understand it. But it will not do to dismiss their teaching on these
grounds. A prejudiced man may yet be speaking the truth. Propositions
developed from special cases may yet be generally valid. And the enemies
and successors of the classics had and have only different but not fewer
blinkers and preconceptions; they envisaged and envisage different but not
less special cases.
From the standpoint of the economic analyst, the chief merit of the
classics consists in their dispelling, along with many other gross errors, the
naïve idea that economic activity in capitalist society, because it turns on the
2 The term Classical Economists will in this book be used to designate the leading English
economists whose works appeared between 1776 and 1848. Adam Smith, Ricardo, Malthus,
Senior and John Stuart Mill are the outstanding names. It is important to keep this in mind
because a much broader use of the term has come into fashion of late.
Can Capitalism Survive?76
profit motive, must by virtue of that fact alone necessarily run counter to the
interests of consumers; or, to put it differently, that moneymaking necessarily
deflects producing from its social goal; or, finally, that private profits, both
in themselves and through the distortion of the economic process they
induce, are always a net loss to all excepting those who receive them and
would therefore constitute a net gain to be reaped by socialization. If we look
at the logic of these and similar propositions which no trained economist ever
thought of defending, the classical refutation may well seem trivial. But as
soon as we look at all the theories and slogans which, consciously or
subconsciously, imply them and which are once more served up today, we
shall feel more respect for that achievement. Let me add at once that the
classical writers also clearly perceived, though they may have exaggerated,
the role of saving and accumulation and that they linked saving to the rate
of “progress” they observed in a manner that was fundamentally, if only
approximately, correct. Above all, there was practical wisdom about their
doctrine, a responsible long-run view and a manly tone that contrast
favorably with modern hysterics.
But between realizing that hunting for a maximum of profit and striving
for maximum productive performance are not necessarily incompatible, to
proving that the former will necessarily—or in the immense majority of
cases—imply the latter, there is a gulf much wider than the classics thought.
And they never succeeded in bridging it. The modern student of their
doctrines never ceases to wonder how it was possible for them to be satisfied
with their arguments or to mistake these arguments for proofs; in the light
of later analysis their theory was seen to be a house of cards whatever
measure of truth there may have been in their vision. 3
3. This later analysis we will take in two strides—as much of it, that is,
as we need in order to clarify our problem. Historically, the first will carry
us into the first decade of this century, the second will cover some of the
postwar developments of scientific economics. Frankly I do not know how
much good this will do the non-professional reader; like every other branch
of our knowledge, economics, as its analytic engine improves, moves fatally
away from that happy stage in which all problems, methods and results could
be made accessible to every educated person without special training. I will,
however, do my best.
The first stride may be associated with two great names revered to this
3 The reader will recall my emphasis on the distinction between one’s theory and one’s
vision in the case of Marx. It is however always important to remember that the ability to
see things in their correct perspective may be, and often is, divorced from the ability to
reason correctly and vice versa. That is why a man may be a very good theorist and yet
talk absolute nonsense whenever confronted with the task of diagnosing a concrete
historical pattern as a whole.
Plausible Capitalism 77
day by numberless disciples—so far at least as the latter do not think it
bad form to express reverence for anything or anybody, which many of
them obviously do—Alfred Marshall and Knut Wicksell. 4 Their
theoretical structure has little in common with that of the classics—
though Marshall did his best to hide the fact—but it conserves the classic
proposition that in the case of perfect competition the profit interest of
the producer tends to maximize production. It even supplied almost
satisfactory proof. Only, in the process of being more correctly stated and
proved, the proposition lost much of its content—it does emerge from the
operation, to be sure, but it emerges emaciated, barely alive. 5 Still it can
be shown, within the general assumptions of the Marshall-Wicksell
analysis, that firms which cannot by their own individual action exert any
influence upon the price of their products or of the factors of production
they employ—so that there would be no point in their weeping over the
fact that any increase in production tends to decrease the former and to
increase the latter—will expand their output until they reach the point at
which the additional cost that must be incurred in order to produce
another small increment of product (marginal cost) just equals the price
they can get for that increment, i.e., that they will produce as much as
4 Marshall’s Principles (first edition 1890) and Wicksell’s Lectures (first Swedish edition
1901, English translation 1934) are entitled to the prominence I am here giving to them, because
of the influence they exerted on many minds in their formative stages and because they dealt
with theory in a thoroughly practical spirit. On purely scientific grounds, precedence should
be given to the work of Léon Walras. In America, the names to mention are J.B.Clark, Irving
Fisher and F.W.Taussig.
5 Anticipating later argument (see below, ch. viii, § 6) I shall in this note briefly clarify
the above passage. Analysis of the mechanism of the profit economy led not only to the
discovery of exceptions to the principle that competitive industry tends to maximize output,
but also to the discovery that proof of the principle itself requires assumptions which reduce
it to little more than a truism. Its practical value is however particularly impaired by the two
following considerations:
1. The principle, as far as it can be proved at all, applies to a state of static equilibrium.
Capitalist reality is first and last a process of change. In appraising the performance of
competitive enterprise, the question whether it would or would not tend to maximize production
in a perfectly equilibrated stationary condition of the economic process is hence almost, though
not quite, irrelevant.
2. The principle, as stated by Wicksell, is what was left of a more ambitious proposition
that, though in a rarefied form, can still be found in Marshall—the theorem that competitive
industry tends to produce a state of maximum satisfaction of wants. But this theorem, even if
we waive the serious objections to speaking of non-observable psychic magnitudes, is readily
seen to boil down to the triviality that, whatever the data and in particular the institutional
arrangements of a society may be, human action, as far as it is rational, will always try to make
the best of any given situation. In fact it boils down to a definition of rational action and can
hence be paralleled by analogous theorems for, say, a socialist society. But so can the principle
of maximum production. Neither formulates any specific virtue of private competitive
enterprise. This does not mean that such virtues do not exist. It does mean however that they
are not simply inherent in the logic of competition.
Can Capitalism Survive?78
they can without running into loss. And this can be shown to be as much
as it is in general “socially desirable” to produce. In more technical
language, in that case prices are, from the standpoint of the individual
firm, not variables but parameters; and where this is so, there exists a
state of equilibrium in which all outputs are at their maximum and all
factors fully employed. This case is usually referred to as perfect
competition. Remembering what has been said about the selective process
which operates on all firms and their managers, we might in fact conceive
a very optimistic idea of the results to be expected from a highly selected
group of people forced, within that pattern, by their profit motive to
strain every nerve in order to maximize output and to minimize costs. In
particular, it might seem at first sight that a system conforming to this
pattern would display remarkable absence of some of the major sources
of social waste. As a little reflection should show, this is really but
another way of stating the content of the preceding sentence.
4. Let us take the second stride. The Marshall-Wicksell analysis of
course did not overlook the many cases that fail to conform to that model.
Nor, for that matter, had the classics overlooked them. They recognized
cases of “monopoly,” and Adam Smith himself carefully noticed the
prevalence of devices to restrict competition 6 and all the differences in
flexibility of prices resulting therefrom. But they looked upon those cases
as exceptions and, moreover, as exceptions that could and would be done
away with in time. Something of that sort is true also of Marshall.
Although he developed the Cournot theory of monopoly 7 and although
he anticipated later analysis by calling attention to the fact that most
firms have special markets of their own in which they set prices instead
of merely accepting them, 8 he as well as Wicksell framed his general
conclusions on the pattern of perfect competition so as to suggest, much
as the classics did, that perfect competition was the rule. Neither Marshall
and Wicksell nor the classics saw that perfect competition is the
exception and that even if it were the rule there would be much less
reason for congratulation than one might think.
If we look more closely at the conditions—not all of them explicitly
stated or even clearly seen by Marshall and Wicksell—that must be
6 In a manner strikingly suggestive of present-day attitudes he even emphasized the
discrepancy between the interests of every trade and those of the public and talked about
conspiracies against the latter which, so he thought, might originate at any businessmen’s
dinner party.
7 Augustin Cournot, 1938.
8 This is why the later theory of imperfect competition may fairly be traced to him. Though
he did not elaborate it, he saw the phenomenon more correctly than most of those who did. In
particular he did not exaggerate its importance.
Plausible Capitalism 79
fulfilled in order to produce perfect competition, we realize immediately
that outside of agricultural mass production there cannot be many instances
of it. A farmer supplies his cotton or wheat in fact under those conditions:
from his standpoint the ruling prices of cotton or wheat are data, though
very variable ones, and not being able to influence them by his individual
action he simply adapts his output; since all farmers do the same, prices
and quantities will in the end be adjusted as the theory of perfect
competition requires. But this is not so even with many agricultural
products—with ducks, sausages, vegetables and many dairy products for
instance. And as regards practically all the finished products and services
of industry and trade, it is clear that every grocer, every filling station,
every manufacturer of gloves or shaving cream or handsaws has a small
and precarious market of his own which he tries—must try—to build up
and to keep by price strategy, quality strategy—“product differentiation”—
and advertising. Thus we get a completely different pattern which there
seems to be no reason to expect to yield the results of perfect competition
and which fits much better into the monopolistic schema. In these cases
we speak of Monopolistic Competition. Their theory has been one of the
major contributions to postwar economics. 9
There remains a wide field of substantially homogeneous products—
mainly industrial raw materials and semi-finished products such as steel
ingots, cement, cotton gray goods and the like—in which the conditions
for the emergence of monopolistic competition do not seem to prevail. This
is so. But in general, similar results follow for that field inasmuch as the
greater part of it is covered by largest-scale firms which, either individually
or in concert, are able to manipulate prices even without differentiating
products—the case of Oligopoly. Again the monopoly schema, suitably
adapted, seems to fit this type of behavior much better than does the
schema of perfect competition.
As soon as the prevalence of monopolistic competition or of oligopoly
or of combinations of the two is recognized, many of the propositions which
the Marshall-Wicksell generation of economists used to teach with the
utmost confidence become either inapplicable or much more difficult to
prove. This holds true, in the first place, of the propositions turning on the
fundamental concept of equilibrium, i.e., a determinate state of the economic
organism, toward which any given state of it is always gravitating and which
displays certain simple properties. In the general case of oligopoly there is
in fact no determinate equilibrium at all and the possibility presents itself
that there may be an endless sequence of moves and countermoves, an
9 See, in particular, E.S.Chamberlin, Theory of Monopolistic Competition, and Joan
Robinson. The Economics of Imperfect Competition.
Can Capitalism Survive?80
indefinite state of warfare between firms. It is true that there are many special
cases in which a state of equilibrium theoretically exists. In the second place,
even in these cases not only is it much harder to attain than the equilibrium
in perfect competition, and still harder to preserve, but the “beneficial”
competition of the classic type seems likely to be replaced by “predatory”
or “cutthroat” competition or simply by struggles for control in the financial
sphere. These things are so many sources of social waste, and there are many
others such as the costs of advertising campaigns, the suppression of new
methods of production (buying up of patents in order not to use them) and
so on. And most important of all: under the conditions envisaged,
equilibrium, even if eventually attained by an extremely costly method, no
longer guarantees either full employment or maximum output in the sense
of the theory of perfect competition. It may exist without full employment;
it is bound to exist, so it seems, at a level of output below that maximum
mark, because profit-conserving strategy, impossible in conditions of perfect
competition, now not only becomes possible but imposes itself.
Well, does not this bear out what the man in the street (unless a
businessman himself) always thought on the subject of private business? Has
not modern analysis completely refuted the classical doctrine and justified
the popular view? Is it not quite true after all, that there is little parallelism
between producing for profit and producing for the consumer and that private
enterprise is little more than a device to curtail production in order to extort
profits which then are correctly described as tolls and ransoms?
81
CHAPTER VII
THE PROCESS OF CREATIVE DESTRUCTION
T HE theories of monopolistic and oligopolistic competition and their
popular variants may in two ways be made to serve the view that
capitalist reality is unfavorable to maximum performance in production.
One may hold that it always has been so and that all along output has been
expanding in spite of the secular sabotage perpetrated by the managing
bourgeoisie. Advocates of this proposition would have to produce evidence
to the effect that the observed rate of increase can be accounted for by a
sequence of favorable circumstances unconnected with the mechanism of
private enterprise and strong enough to overcome the latter’s resistance.
This is precisely the question which we shall discuss in Chapter IX.
However, those who espouse this variant at least avoid the trouble about
historical fact that the advocates of the alternative proposition have to face.
This avers that capitalist reality once tended to favor maximum productive
performance, or at all events productive performance so considerable as to
constitute a major element in any serious appraisal of the system; but that
the later spread of monopolist structures, killing competition, has by now
reversed that tendency.
First, this involves the creation of an entirely imaginary golden age of
perfect competition that at some time somehow metamorphosed itself into
the monopolistic age, whereas it is quite clear that perfect competition has
at no time been more of a reality than it is at present. Secondly, it is
necessary to point out that the rate of increase in output did not decrease
from the nineties from which, I suppose, the prevalence of the largest-size
concerns, at least in manufacturing industry, would have to be dated; that
there is nothing in the behavior of the time series of total output to suggest
a “break in trend”; and, most important of all, that the modern standard of
life of the masses evolved during the period of relatively unfettered “big
business.” If we list the items that enter the modern workman’s budget and
from 1899 on observe the course of their prices not in terms of money but
in terms of the hours of labor that will buy them—i.e., each year’s money
prices divided by each year’s hourly wage rates—we cannot fail to be struck
by the rate of the advance which, considering the spectacular improvement
in qualities, seems to have been greater and not smaller than it ever was
before. If we economists were given less to wishful thinking and more to
Can Capitalism Survive?82
the observation of facts, doubts would immediately arise as to the realistic
virtues of a theory that would have led us to expect a very different result.
Nor is this all. As soon as we go into details and inquire into the individual
items in which progress was most conspicuous, the trail leads not to the
doors of those firms that work under conditions of comparatively free
competition but precisely to the doors of the large concerns—which, as in
the case of agricultural machinery, also account for much of the progress in
the competitive sector—and a shocking suspicion dawns upon us that big
business may have had more to do with creating that standard of life than
with keeping it down.
The conclusions alluded to at the end of the preceding chapter are in fact
almost completely false. Yet they follow from observations and theorems that
are almost completely 1 true. Both economists and popular writers have once
more run away with some fragments of reality they happened to grasp. These
fragments themselves were mostly seen correctly. Their formal properties
were mostly developed correctly. But no conclusions about capitalist reality
as a whole follow from such fragmentary analyses. If we draw them
nevertheless, we can be right only by accident. That has been done. And the
lucky accident did not happen.
The essential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism we are
dealing with an evolutionary process. It may seem strange that anyone can
fail to see so obvious a fact which moreover was long ago emphasized by
Karl Marx. Yet that fragmentary analysis which yields the bulk of our
propositions about the functioning of modern capitalism persistently neglects
it. Let us restate the point and see how it bears upon our problem.
Capitalism, then, is by nature a form or method of economic change and
not only never is but never can be stationary. And this evolutionary character
of the capitalist process is not merely due to the fact that economic life goes
on in a social and natural environment which changes and by its change
alters the data of economic action; this fact is important and these changes
(wars, revolutions and so on) often condition industrial change, but they are
not its prime movers. Nor is this evolutionary character due to a quasi-
automatic increase in population and capital or to the vagaries of monetary
systems of which exactly the same thing holds true. The fundamental
1 As a matter of fact, those observations and theorems are not completely satisfactory. The
usual expositions of the doctrine of imperfect competition fail in particular to give due attention
to the many and important cases in which, even as a matter of static theory, imperfect
competition approximates the results of perfect competition. There are other cases in which it
does not do this, but offers compensations which, while not entering any output index, yet
contribute to what the output index is in the last resort intended to measure—the cases in which
a firm defends its market by establishing a name for quality and service for instance. However,
in order to simplify matters, we will not take issue with that doctrine on its own ground.
The Process of Creative Destruction 83
impulse that sets and keeps the capitalist engine in motion comes from the
new consumers’ goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the
new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist
enterprise creates.
As we have seen in the preceding chapter, the contents of the laborer’s
budget, say from 1760 to 1940, did not simply grow on unchanging lines
but they underwent a process of qualitative change. Similarly, the history
of the productive apparatus of a typical farm, from the beginnings of the
rationalization of crop rotation, plowing and fattening to the mechanized
thing of today—linking up with elevators and railroads—is a history of
revolutions. So is the history of the productive apparatus of the iron and
steel industry from the charcoal furnace to our own type of furnace, or the
history of the apparatus of power production from the overshot water wheel
to the modern power plant, or the history of transportation from the
mailcoach to the airplane. The opening up of new markets, foreign or
domestic, and the organizational development from the craft shop and
factory to such concerns as U.S. Steel illustrate the same process of
industrial mutation—if I may use that biological term—that incessantly
revolutionizes 2 the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying
the old one, incessantly creating a new one. This process of Creative
Destruction is the essential fact about capitalism. It is what capitalism
consists in and what every capitalist concern has got to live in. This fact
bears upon our problem in two ways.
First, since we are dealing with a process whose every element takes
considerable time in revealing its true features and ultimate effects, there is
no point in appraising the performance of that process ex visu of a given
point of time; we must judge its performance over time, as it unfolds through
decades or centuries. A system—any system, economic or other—that at
every given point of time fully utilizes its possibilities to the best advantage
may yet in the long run be inferior to a system that does so at no given point
of time, because the latter’s failure to do so may be a condition for the level
or speed of long-run performance.
Second, since we are dealing with an organic process, analysis of what
happens in any particular part of it—say, in an individual concern or
industry—may indeed clarify details of mechanism but is inconclusive
beyond that. Every piece of business strategy acquires its true significance
only against the background of that process and within the situation created
2 Those revolutions are not strictly incessant; they occur in discrete rushes which are
separated from each other by spans of comparative quiet. The process as a whole works
incessantly however, in the sense that there always is either revolution or absorption of the
results of revolution, both together forming what are known as business cycles.
Can Capitalism Survive?84
by it. It must be seen in its role in the perennial gale of creative destruction;
it cannot be understood irrespective of it or, in fact, on the hypothesis that
there is a perennial lull.
But economists who, ex visu of a point of time, look for example at the
behavior of an oligopolist industry—an industry which consists of a few big
firms—and observe the well-known moves and countermoves within it that
seem to aim at nothing but high prices and restrictions of output are making
precisely that hypothesis. They accept the data of the momentary situation
as if there were no past or future to it and think that they have understood
what there is to understand if they interpret the behavior of those firms by
means of the principle of maximizing profits with reference to those data.
The usual theorist’s paper and the usual government commission’s report
practically never try to see that behavior, on the one hand, as a result of a
piece of past history and, on the other hand, as an attempt to deal with a
situation that is sure to change presently—as an attempt by those firms to
keep on their feet, on ground that is slipping away from under them. In other
words, the problem that is usually being visualized is how capitalism
administers existing structures, whereas the relevant problem is how it creates
and destroys them. As long as this is not recognized, the investigator does a
meaningless job. As soon as it is recognized, his outlook on capitalist
practice and its social results changes considerably. 3
The first thing to go is the traditional conception of the modus operandi
of competition. Economists are at long last emerging from the stage in which
price competition was all they saw. As soon as quality competition and sales
effort are admitted into the sacred precincts of theory, the price variable is
ousted from its dominant position. However, it is still competition within a
rigid pattern of invariant conditions, methods of production and forms of
industrial organization in particular, that practically monopolizes attention.
But in capitalist reality as distinguished from its textbook picture, it is not
that kind of competition which counts but the competition from the new
commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of
organization (the largest-scale unit of control for instance)—competition
which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not
at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their
foundations and their very lives. This kind of competition is as much more
effective than the other as a bombardment is in comparison with forcing a
3 It should be understood that it is only our appraisal of economic performance and not our
moral judgment that can be so changed. Owing to its autonomy, moral approval or disapproval
is entirely independent of our appraisal of social (or any other) results, unless we happen to
adopt a moral system such as utilitarianism which makes moral approval and disapproval turn
on them ex definitions.
The Process of Creative Destruction 85
door, and so much more important that it becomes a matter of comparative
indifference whether competition in the ordinary sense functions more or less
promptly; the powerful lever that in the long run expands output and brings
down prices is in any case made of other stuff.
It is hardly necessary to point out that competition of the kind we now
have in mind acts not only when in being but also when it is merely an ever-
present threat. It disciplines before it attacks. The businessman feels himself
to be in a competitive situation even if he is alone in his field or if, though
not alone, he holds a position such that investigating government experts fail
to see any effective competition between him and any other firms in the same
or a neighboring field and in consequence conclude that his talk, under
examination, about his competitive sorrows is all make-believe. In many
cases, though not in all, this will in the long run enforce behavior very
similar to the perfectly competitive pattern.
Many theorists take the opposite view which is best conveyed by an
example. Let us assume that there is a certain number of retailers in a
neighborhood who try to improve their relative position by service and
“atmosphere” but avoid price competition and stick as to methods to the local
tradition—a picture of stagnating routine. As others drift into the trade that
quasi-equilibrium is indeed upset, but in a manner that does not benefit their
customers. The economic space around each of the shops having been
narrowed, their owners will no longer be able to make a living and they will
try to mend the case by raising prices in tacit agreement. This will further
reduce their sales and so, by successive pyramiding, a situation will evolve
in which increasing potential supply will be attended by increasing instead
of decreasing prices and by decreasing instead of increasing sales.
Such cases do occur, and it is right and proper to work them out. But as
the practical instances usually given show, they are fringe-end cases to be
found mainly in the sectors furthest removed from all that is most
characteristic of capitalist activity.4 Moreover, they are transient by nature.
In the case of retail trade the competition that matters arises not from
additional shops of the same type, but from the department store, the chain
store, the mail-order house and the supermarket which are bound to destroy
those pyramids sooner or later. 5
4 This is also shown by a theorem we frequently meet with in expositions of the theory of
imperfect competition, viz., the theorem that, under conditions of imperfect competition,
producing or trading businesses tend to be irrationally small. Since imperfect competition is at
the same time held to be an outstanding characteristic of modern industry we are set to
wondering what world these theorists live in, unless, as stated above, fringe-end cases are all
they have in mind.
5 The mere threat of their attack cannot, in the particular conditions, environmental and
personal, of small-scale retail trade, have its usual disciplining influence, for the small man is
too much hampered by his cost structure and, however well he may manage within his

the case neglects all that is most typically capitalist about it; even if correct
in logic as well as in fact, it is like Hamlet without the Danish prince.
inescapable limitations, he can never adapt him self to the methods of competitors who can
afford to sell at the price at which he buys.
87
CHAPTER VIII
MONOPOLISTIC PRACTICES
W HAT has been said so far is really sufficient to enable the reader to
deal with the large majority of the practical cases he is likely to meet
and to realize the inadequacy of most of those criticisms of the profit
economy which, directly or indirectly, rely on the absence of perfect
competition. Since, however, the bearing of our argument on some of those
criticisms may not be obvious at a glance, it will be worth our while to
elaborate a little in order to make a few points more explicit.
1. We have just seen that, both as a fact and as a threat, the impact of
new things—new technologies for instance—on the existing structure of an
industry considerably reduces the long-run scope and importance of
practices that aim, through restricting output, at conserving established
positions and at maximizing the profits accruing from them. We must now
recognize the further fact that restrictive practices of this kind, as far as
they are effective, acquire a new significance in the perennial gale of
creative destruction, a significance which they would not have in a
stationary state or in a state of slow and balanced growth. In either of these
cases restrictive strategy would produce no result other than an increase
in profits at the expense of buyers except that, in the case of balanced
advance, it might still prove to be the easiest and most effective way of
collecting the means by which to finance additional investment. 1 But in the
process of creative destruction, restrictive practices may do much to steady
the ship and to alleviate temporary difficulties. This is in fact a very
familiar argument which always turns up in times of depression and, as
everyone knows, has become very popular with governments and their
economic advisers—witness the NRA. While it has been so much misused
and so faultily acted upon that most economists heartily despise it, those
1 Theorists are apt to look upon anyone who admits this possibility as guilty of gross error,
and to prove immediately that financing by borrowing from banks or from private savers or, in
the case of public enterprise, financing from the proceeds of an income tax is much more
rational than is financing from surplus profits collected through a restrictive policy. For some
patterns of behavior they are quite right. For others they are quite wrong. I believe that both
capitalism and communism of the Russian type belong in the latter category. But the point is
that theoretical considerations, especially theoretical considerations of the shortrun kind, cannot
solve, although they contribute to the solution of, the problem which we shall meet again in
the next part.
Can Capitalism Survive?88
same advisers who are responsible for this 2 invariably fail to see its much
more general rationale.
Practically any investment entails, as a necessary complement of
entrepreneurial action, certain safeguarding activities such as insuring or
hedging. Long-range investing under rapidly changing conditions,
especially under conditions that change or may change at any moment
under the impact of new commodities and technologies, is like shooting
at a target that is not only indistinct but moving—and moving jerkily at
that. Hence it becomes necessary to resort to such protecting devices as
patents or temporary secrecy of processes or, in some cases, long-period
contracts secured in advance. But these protecting devices which most
economists accept as normal elements of rational management 3 are only
special cases of a larger class comprising many others which most
economists condemn although they do not differ fundamentally from the
recognized ones.
If for instance a war risk is insurable, nobody objects to a firm’s
collecting the cost of this insurance from the buyers of its products. But
that risk is no less an element in long-run costs, if there are no facilities
for insuring against it, in which case a price strategy aiming at the same
end will seem to involve unnecessary restriction and to be productive of
excess profits. Similarly, if a patent cannot be secured or would not, if
secured, effectively protect, other means may have to be used in order to
justify the investment. Among them are a price policy that will make it
possible to write off more quickly than would otherwise be rational, or
additional investment in order to provide excess capacity to be used only
for aggression or defense. Again, if long-period contracts cannot be entered
into in advance, other means may have to be devised in order to tie
prospective customers to the investing firm.
In analyzing such business strategy ex visu of a given point of time, the
investigating economist or government agent sees price policies that seem
to him predatory and restrictions of output that seem to him synonymous
with loss of opportunities to produce. He does not see that restrictions of this
type are, in the conditions of the perennial gale, incidents, often unavoidable
incidents, of a long-run process of expansion which they protect rather than
impede. There is no more of paradox in this than there is in saying that
2 In particular, it is easy to show that there is no sense, and plenty of harm, in a policy that
aims at preserving “price parities.”
3 Some economists, however, consider that even those devices are obstructions to progress
which, though perhaps necessary in capitalist society, would be absent in a socialist one. There
is some truth in this. But that does not affect the proposition that the protection afforded by
patents and so on is, in the conditions of a profit economy, on balance a propelling and not an
inhibiting factor.
Monopolistic Practices 89
motorcars are traveling faster than they otherwise would because they are
provided with brakes.
2. This stands out most clearly in the case of those sectors of the economy
which at any time happen to embody the impact of new things and methods
on the existing industrial structure. The best way of getting a vivid and
realistic idea of industrial strategy is indeed to visualize the behavior of new
concerns or industries that introduce new commodities or processes (such as
the aluminum industry) or else reorganize a part or the whole of an industry
(such as, for instance, the old Standard Oil Company).
As we have seen, such concerns are aggressors by nature and wield the
really effective weapon of competition. Their intrusion can only in the
rarest of cases fail to improve total output in quantity or quality, both
through the new method itself—even if at no time used to full advantage—
and through the pressure it exerts on the preexisting firms. But these
aggressors are so circumstanced as to require, for purposes of attack and
defense, also pieces of armor other than price and quality of their product
which, moreover, must be strategically manipulated all along so that at any
point of time they seem to be doing nothing but restricting their output and
keeping prices high.
On the one hand, largest-scale plans could in many cases not
materialize at all if it were not known from the outset that competition
will be discouraged by heavy capital requirements or lack of experience,
or that means are available to discourage or checkmate it so as to gain
the time and space for further developments. Even the conquest of
financial control over competing concerns in otherwise unassailable
positions or the securing of advantages that run counter to the public’s
sense of fair play—railroad rebates—move, as far as long-run effects on
total output alone are envisaged, into a different light; 4 they may be
methods for removing obstacles that the institution of private property
puts in the path of progress. In a socialist society that time and space
4 The qualification added removes, I think, any just cause for offense that the above
proposition might conceivably cause. In case that qualification is not explicit enough, I beg
leave to repeat that the moral aspect is in this case, as it must be in every case, entirely
unaffected by an economic argument. For the rest, let the reader reflect that even in dealing
with indubitably criminal actions every civilized judge and every civilized jury take account
of the ulterior purpose in pursuit of which a crime has occurred and of the difference it makes
whether an action that is a crime has or has not also effects they consider socially desirable.
Another objection would be more to the point. If an enterprise can succeed only by such
means, does not that prove in itself that it cannot spell social gain? A very simple argument
can be framed in support of this view. But it is subject to a severe ceteris paribus proviso. That
is to say, it holds for conditions which are just about equivalent to excluding the process of
creative destruction—capitalist reality. On reflection, it will be seen that the analogy of the
practices under discussion with patents is sufficient to show this.
Can Capitalism Survive?90
would be no less necessary. They would have to be secured by order of
the central authority.
On the other hand, enterprise would in most cases be impossible if it were
not known from the outset that exceptionally favorable situations are likely to
arise which if exploited by price, quality and quantity manipulation will produce
profits adequate to tide over exceptionally unfavorable situations provided these
are similarly managed Again this requires strategy that in the short run is often
restrictive. In the majority of successful cases this strategy just manages to serve
its purpose. In some cases, however, it is so successful as to yield profits far
above what is necessary in order to induce the corresponding investment. These
cases then provide the baits that lure capital on to untried trails. Their presence
explains in part how it is possible for so large a section of the capitalist world
to work for nothing: in the midst of the prosperous twenties just about half of
the business corporations in the United States were run at a loss, at zero profits,
or at profits which, if they had been foreseen, would have been inadequate to
call forth the effort and expenditure involved.
Our argument however extends beyond the cases of new concerns,
methods and industries. Old concerns and established industries, whether or
not directly attacked, still live in the perennial gale. Situations emerge in the
process of creative destruction in which many firms may have to perish that
nevertheless would be able to live on vigorously and usefully if they could
weather a particular storm. Short of such general crises or depressions,
sectional situations arise in which the rapid change of data that is
characteristic of that process so disorganizes an industry for the time being
as to inflict functionless losses and to create avoidable unemployment.
Finally, there is certainly no point in trying to conserve obsolescent industries
indefinitely; but there is point in trying to avoid their coming down with a
crash and in attempting to turn a rout, which may become a center of
cumulative depressive effects, into orderly retreat. Correspondingly there is,
in the case of industries that have sown their wild oats but are still gaining
and not losing ground, such a thing as orderly advance. 5
5 A good example illustrative of this point—in fact of much of our general argument—is
the postwar history of the automobile and the rayon industry. The first illustrates very well the
nature and value of what we might call “edited” competition. The bonanza time was over by
about 1916. A host of firms nevertheless crowded into the industry afterwards, most of which
were eliminated by 1925. From a fierce life and death struggle three concerns emerged that by
now account for over 80 per cent of total sales. They are under competitive pressure inasmuch
as, in spite of the advantages of an established position, an elaborate sales and service
organization and so on, any failure to keep up and improve the quality of their products or any
attempt at monopolistic combination would call in new competitors. Among themselves, the
three concerns behave in a way which should be called corespective rather than competitive:
they refrain from certain aggressive devices (which, by the way, would also be absent in perfect
competition); they keep up with each other and in doing so play for points at the frontiers. This
Monopolistic Practices 91
All this is of course nothing but the tritest common sense. But it is being
overlooked with a persistence so stubborn as sometimes to raise the question
of sincerity. And it follows that, within the process of creative destruction,
all the realities of which theorists are in the habit of relegating to books and
courses on business cycles, there is another side to industrial self-
organization than that which these theorists are contemplating. “Restraints
of trade” of the cartel type as well as those which merely consist in tacit
understandings about price competition may be effective remedies under
conditions of depression. As far as they are, they may in the end produce
not only steadier but also greater expansion of total output than could be
secured by an entirely uncontrolled onward rush that cannot fail to be
studded with catastrophes. Nor can it be argued that these catastrophes occur
in any case. We know what has happened in each historical case. We have a
very imperfect idea of what might have happened, considering the
tremendous pace of the process, if such pegs had been entirely absent.
Even as now extended however, our argument does not cover all cases of
restrictive or regulating strategy, many of which no doubt have that injurious
effect on the long-run development of output which is uncritically attributed
to all of them. And even in the cases our argument does cover, the net effect
is a question of the circumstances and of the way in which and the degree
to which industry regulates itself in each individual case. It is certainly as
conceivable that an all-pervading cartel system might sabotage all progress
as it is that it might realize, with smaller social and private costs, all that
perfect competition is supposed to realize. This is why our argument does
not amount to a case against state regulation. It does show that there is no
general case for indiscriminate “trust-busting” or for the prosecution of
everything that qualifies as a restraint of trade. Rational as distinguished from
vindictive regulation by public authority turns out to be an extremely delicate
problem which not every government agency, particularly when in full cry
has now gone on for upwards of fifteen years and it is not obvious that if conditions of
theoretically perfect competition had prevailed during that period, better or cheaper cars would
now be offered to the public, or higher wages and more or steadier employment to the workmen.
The rayon industry had its bonanza time in the twenties. It presents the features incident to
introducing a commodity into fields fully occupied before and the policies that impose
themselves in such conditions still more clearly than does the automobile industry. And there
are a number of other differences. But fundamentally the case is similar. The expansion in
quantity and quality of rayon output is common knowledge. Yet restrictive policy presided over
this expansion at each individual point of time.
6 Unfortunately, this statement is almost as effective a bar to agreement on policy as the
most thoroughgoing denial of any case for government regulation could be. In fact it may
embitter discussion. Politicians, public officers and economists can stand what I may politely
term the whole-hog opposition of “economic royalists.” Doubts about their competence, such
as crowd upon us particularly when we see the legal mind at work, are much more difficult
for them to stand.
Can Capitalism Survive?92
against big business, can be trusted to solve. 6 But our argument, framed to
refute a prevalent theory and the inferences drawn therefrom about the
relation between modern capitalism and the development of total output, only
yields another theory, i.e., another outlook on facts and another principle by
which to interpret them. For our purpose that is enough. For the rest, the facts
themselves have the floor.
3. Next, a few words on the subject of Rigid Prices which has been
receiving so much attention of late. It really is but a particular aspect of the
problem we have been discussing. We shall define rigidity as follows: a price
is rigid if it is less sensitive to changes in the conditions of demand and
supply than it would be if perfect competition prevailed. 7
Quantitatively, the extent to which prices are rigid in that sense depends on
the material and the method of measurement we select and is hence a doubtful
matter. But whatever the material or method, it is certain that prices are not
nearly as rigid as they seem to be. There are many reasons why what in effect
is a change in price should not show in the statistical picture; in other words,
why there should be much spurious rigidity. I shall mention only one class of
them which is closely connected with the facts stressed by our analysis.
I have adverted to the importance, for the capitalist process in general and
for its competitive mechanism in particular, of the intrusion of new
commodities. Now a new commodity may effectively bring down the
preexisting structure and satisfy a given want at much lower prices per unit
of service (transportation service for instance), and yet not a single recorded
price need change in the process; flexibility in the relevant sense may be
accompanied by rigidity in a formal sense. There are other cases, not of this
type, in which price reduction is the sole motive for bringing out a new brand
while the old one is left at the previous quotation—again a price reduction
that does not show. Moreover, the great majority of new consumers’ goods—
particularly all the gadgets of modern life—are at first introduced in an
experimental and unsatisfactory form in which they could never conquer
their potential markets. Improvement in the quality of products is hence a
practically universal feature of the development of individual concerns and
of industries. Whether or not this improvement involves additional costs, a
constant price per unit of an improving commodity should not be called rigid
without further investigation.
Of course, plenty of cases of genuine price rigidity remain—of prices
7 This definition suffices for our purposes but would not be satisfactory for others. See
D.D.Humphrey’s article in the Journal of Political Economy, October 1937, and E.S.Mason’s
article in the Review of Economic Statistics, May 1938. Professor Mason has shown, among
other things, that contrary to a widespread belief price rigidity is not increasing or, at all events,
that it is no greater than it was forty years ago, a result which in itself suffices to invalidate
some of the implications of the current doctrine of rigidity.
Monopolistic Practices 93
which are being kept constant as a matter of business policy or which remain
unchanged because it is difficult to change, say, a price set by a cartel after
laborious negotiations. In order to appraise the influence of this fact on the
long-run development of output, it is first of all necessary to realize that this
rigidity is essentially a short-run phenomenon. There are no major instances
of long-run rigidity of prices. Whichever manufacturing industry or group
of manufactured articles of any importance we choose to investigate over a
period of time, we practically always find that in the long run prices do not
fail to adapt themselves to technological progress—frequently they fall
spectacularly in response to it 8
—unless prevented from doing so by monetary
events and policies or, in some cases, by autonomous changes in wage rates
which of course should be taken into account by appropriate corrections
exactly as should changes in quality of products. 9 And our previous analysis
shows sufficiently why in the process of capitalist evolution this must be so.
What the business strategy in question really aims at—all, in any case,
that it can achieve—is to avoid seasonal, random and cyclical fluctuations
in prices and to move only in response to the more fundamental changes
in the conditions that underlie those fluctuations. Since these more
fundamental changes take time in declaring themselves, this involves
moving slowly by discrete steps—keeping to a price until new relatively
durable contours have emerged into view. In technical language, this
strategy aims at moving along a step function that will approximate
trends. And that is what genuine and voluntary price rigidity in most
cases amounts to. In fact, most economists do admit this, at least by
implication. For though some of their arguments about rigidity would
hold true only if the phenomenon were a long-run one—for instance most
of the arguments averring that price rigidity keeps the fruits of
technological progress from consumers—in practice they measure and
discuss primarily cyclical rigidity and especially the fact that many prices
do not, or do not promptly, fall in recessions and depressions. The real
question is therefore how this short-run rigidity 10 may affect the long-run
development of total output. Within this question, the only really
8 They do not as a rule fall as they would under conditions of perfect competition. But this
is true only ceteris paribus, and this proviso robs the proposition of all practical importance. I
have adverted to this point before and shall return to it below (§ 5).
9 From a welfare standpoint, it is proper to adopt a definition different from ours, and to
measure price changes in terms of the hours of labor that are currently necessary to earn the
dollars which will buy given quantities of manufactured consumers’ goods, taking account of
changes of quality. We have already done this in the course of a previous argument. A long-
run downward flexibility is then revealed that is truly impressive. Changes in price level raise
another problem. So far as they reflect monetary influences they should be eliminated for most
of the purposes of an investigation into rigidity. But so far as they reflect the combined effect
of increasing efficiencies in all lines of production they should not.
Can Capitalism Survive?94
important issue is this: prices that stay up in recession or depression no
doubt influence the business situation in those phases of the cycles; if that
influence is strongly injurious—making matters much worse than they
would be with perfect flexibility all round—the destruction wrought each
time might also affect output in the subsequent recoveries and
prosperities and thus permanently reduce the rate of increase in total
output below what it would be in the absence of those rigidities. Two
arguments have been put forth in favor of this view.
In order to put the first into the strongest possible light, let us assume
that an industry which refuses to reduce prices in recession goes on selling
exactly the same quantity of product which it would sell if it had reduced
them. Buyers are therefore out of pocket by the amount to which the
industry profits from the rigidity. If these buyers are the kind of people
who spend all they can and it the industry or those to whom its net returns
go does not spend the increment it gets but either keeps it idle or repays
bank loans, then total expenditure in the economy may be reduced thereby.
If this happens, other industries or firms may suffer and if thereupon they
restrict in turn, we may get a cumulation of depressive effects. In other
words, rigidity may so influence the amount and distribution of national
income as to decrease balances or to increase idle balances or, if we adopt
a popular misnomer, savings. Such a case is conceivable. But the reader
should have little difficulty in satisfying himself 11 that its practical
importance, if any, is very small
The second argument turns on the dislocating effects price rigidity
may exert if, in the individual industry itself or elsewhere, it leads to an
additional restriction of output, i.e., to a restriction greater than that
which must in any case occur during depression. Since the most
important conductor of those effects is the incident increase in
unemployment—unstabilization of employment is in fact the indictment
most commonly directed against price rigidity—and the consequent
10 It should, however, be observed that this short run may last longer than the term
“short run” usually implies—sometimes ten years and even longer. There is not one
cycle, but there are many simultaneous ones of varying duration. One of the most
important ones lasts on the average about nine years and a half. Structural changes
requiring price adjustments do in important cases occur in periods of about that length.
The full extent of the spectacular changes reveals itself only in periods much longer
than this. To do justice to aluminum, rayon, or motorcar prices one must survey a
period of about forty-five years.
11 The best method of doing this is to work out carefully all the assumptions involved, not
only in the strong case imagined but also in the weaker cases that are less unlikely to occur in
practice. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the profit due to keeping prices up may be
the means of avoiding bankruptcy or at least the necessity of discontinuing operations, both of
which might be much more effective in starting a downward “vicious spiral” than is a possible
reduction in total expenditure. See the comments on the second argument.
Monopolistic Practices 95
decrease in total expenditure, this argument then follows in the tracks of
the first one. Its practical weight is considerably reduced, although
economists greatly differ as to the extent, by the consideration that in the
most conspicuous cases price rigidity is motivated precisely by the low
sensitiveness of demand to short-run price changes within the practicable
range. People who in depression worry about their future are not likely
to buy a new car even if the price were reduced by 25 per cent, especially
if the purchase is easily postponable and if the reduction induces
expectations of further reductions.
Quite irrespective of this however, the argument is inconclusive
because it is again vitiated by a ceteris paribus clause that is inadmissible
in dealing with our process of creative destruction. From the fact, so far
as it is a fact, that at more flexible prices greater quantities could ceteris
paribus be sold, it does not follow that either the output of the
commodities in question, or total output and hence employment, would
actually be greater. For inasmuch as we may assume that the refusal to
lower prices strengthens the position of the industries which adopt that
policy either by increasing their revenue or simply by avoiding chaos in
their markets—that is to say, so far as this policy is something more than
a mistake on their part—it may make fortresses out of what otherwise
might be centers of devastation. As we have seen before, from a more
general standpoint, total output and employment may well keep on a
higher level with the restrictions incident to that policy than they would
if depression were allowed to play havoc with the price structure. 12 In
other words, under the conditions created by capitalist evolution, perfect
and universal flexibility of prices might in depression further unstabilize
the system, instead of stabilizing it as it no doubt would under the
conditions envisaged by general theory. Again this is to a large extent
recognized in those cases in which the economist is in sympathy with the
interests immediately concerned, for instance in the case of labor and of
agriculture; in those cases he admits readily enough that what looks like
rigidity may be no more than regulated adaptation.
Perhaps the reader feels some surprise that so little remains of a
doctrine of which so much has been made in the last few years. The
rigidity of prices has become, with some people, the outstanding defect
of the capitalist engine and—almost—the fundamental factor in the
explanation of depressions. But there is nothing to wonder at in this.
Individuals and groups snatch at anything that will qualify as a discovery
lending support to the political tendencies of the hour. The doctrine of
12 The theorist’s way to put the point is that in depression demand curves might shift
downwards much more violently if all pegs were withdrawn from under all prices
Can Capitalism Survive?96
price rigidity, with a modicum of truth to its credit, is not the worst case
of this kind by a long way.
4. Another doctrine has crystallized into a slogan, viz., that in the era of
big business the maintenance of the value of existing investment—
conservation of capital—becomes the chief aim of entrepreneurial activity
and bids fair to put a stop to all cost-reducing improvement. Hence the
capitalist order becomes incompatible with progress.
Progress entails, as we have seen, destruction of capital values in the strata
with which the new commodity or method of production competes. In
perfect competition the old investments must be adapted at a sacrifice or
abandoned; but when there is no perfect competition and when each
industrial field is controlled by a few big concerns, these can in various ways
fight the threatening attack on their capital structure and try to avoid losses
on their capital accounts; that is to say, they can and will fight progress itself.
So far as this doctrine merely formulates a particular aspect of
restrictive business strategy, there is no need to add anything to the
argument already sketched in this chapter. Both as to the limits of that
strategy and as to its functions in the process of creative destruction, we
should only be repeating what has been said before. This becomes still
more obvious if we observe that conserving capital values is the same
thing as conserving profits. Modern theory tends in fact to use the
concept Present Net Value of Assets (=capital values) in place of the
concept of Profits. Both asset values and profits are of course not being
simply conserved but maximized.
But the point about the sabotage of cost-reducing improvement still calls
for comment in passing. As a little reflection will show, it is sufficient to
consider the case of a concern that controls a technological device—some
patent, say—the use of which would involve scrapping some or all of its
plant and equipment. Will it, in order to conserve its capital values, refrain
from using this device when a management not fettered by capitalist
interests such as a socialist management could and would use it to the
advantage of all?
Again it is tempting to raise the question of fact. The first thing a modern
concern does as soon as it feels that it can afford it is to establish a research
department every member of which knows that his bread and butter depends
on his success in devising improvements. This practice does not obviously
suggest aversion to technological progress. Nor can we in reply be referred
to the cases in which patents acquired by business concerns have not been
used promptly or not been used at all. For there may be perfectly good
reasons for this; for example, the patented process may turn out to be no
good or at least not to be in shape to warrant application on a commercial
Monopolistic Practices 97
basis. Neither the inventors themselves nor the investigating economists or
government officials are unbiased judges of this, and from their
remonstrances or reports we may easily get a very distorted picture. 13
But we are concerned with a question of theory. Everyone agrees that
private and socialist managements will introduce improvements if, with the
new method of production, the total cost per unit of product is expected to
be smaller than the prime cost per unit of product with the method actually
in use. If this condition is not fulfilled, then it is held that private
management will not adopt a cost-reducing method until the existing plant
and equipment is entirely written off, whereas socialist management would,
to the social advantage, replace the old by any new cost-reducing method
as soon as such a method becomes available, i.e., without regard to capital
values. This however is not so. 14
Private management, if actuated by the profit motive, cannot be
interested in maintaining the values of any given building or machine any
more than a socialist management would be. All that private management
tries to do is to maximize the present net value of total assets which is
equal to the discounted value of expected net returns. This amounts to
saying that it will always adopt a new method of production which it
believes will yield a larger stream of future income per unit of the
corresponding stream of future outlay, both discounted to the present, than
does the method actually in use. The value of past investment, whether or
not paralleled by a bonded debt that has to be amortized, does not enter
at all except in the sense and to the extent that it would also have to enter
into the calculation underlying the decisions of a socialist management. So
far as the use of the old machines saves future costs as compared with the
immediate introduction of the new methods, the remainder of their service
value is of course an element of the decision for both the capitalist and the
socialist manager; otherwise bygones are bygones for both of them and any
attempt to conserve the value of past investment would conflict as much
with the rules following from the profit motive as it would conflict with
the rules set for the behavior of the socialist manager.
13 Incidentally, it should be noticed that the kind of restrictive practice under discussion,
granted that it exists to a significant extent, would not be without compensatory effects on
social welfare. In fact, the same critics who talk about sabotage of progress at the same time
emphasize the social losses incident to the pace of capitalist progress, particularly the
unemployment which that pace entails and which slower advance might mitigate to some
extent. Well, is technological progress too quick or too slow for them? They had better make
up their minds.
14 It should be observed that even if the argument were correct, it would still be inadequate
to support the thesis that capitalism is, under the conditions envisaged, “incompatible with
technological progress.” All that it would prove is, for some cases, the presence of a lag of
ordinarily moderate length in the introduction of new methods.
Can Capitalism Survive?98
It is however not true that private firms owning equipment the value of
which is endangered by a new method which they also control—if they do
not control it, there is no problem and no indictment—will adopt the new
method only if total unit cost with it is smaller than prime unit cost with
the old one, or if the old investment has been completely written off
according to the schedule decided on before the new method presented
itself. For if the new machines when installed are expected to outlive the
rest of the period previously set for the use of the old machines, their
discounted remainder value as of that date is another asset to be taken
account of. Nor is it true, for analogous reasons, that a socialist
management, if acting rationally, would always and immediately adopt any
new method which promises to produce at smaller total unit costs or that
this would be to the social advantage.
There is however another element15 which profoundly affects behavior in
this matter and which is being invariably overlooked. This is what might be
called ex ante conservation of capital in expectation of further improvement.
Frequently, if not in most cases, a going concern does not simply face the
question whether or not to adopt a definite new method of production that
is the best thing out and, in the form immediately available, can be expected
to retain that position for some length of time. A new type of machine is in
general but a link in a chain of improvements and may presently become
obsolete. In a case like this it would obviously not be rational to follow the
chain link by link regardless of the capital loss to be suffered each time. The
real question then is at which link the concern should take action. The
answer must be in the nature of a compromise between considerations that
rest largely on guesses. But it will as a rule involve some waiting in order
to see how the chain behaves. And to the outsider this may well look like
trying to stifle improvement in order to conserve existing capital values. Yet
even the most patient of comrades would revolt if a socialist management
were so foolish as to follow the advice of the theorist and to keep on
scrapping plant and equipment every year.
5. I have entitled this chapter as I did because most of it deals with the
facts and problems that common parlance associates with monopoly or
monopolistic practice. So far I have as much as possible refrained from using
those terms in order to reserve for a separate section some comments on a
few topics specifically connected with them. Nothing will be said however
that we have not already met in one form or another.
(a) To begin with, there is the term itself. Monopolist means Single Seller.
15 There are of course many other elements. The reader will please understand that in
dealing with a few questions of principles it is impossible to do full justice to any of the
topics touched upon.
Monopolistic Practices 99
Literally therefore anyone is a monopolist who sells anything that is not in
every respect, wrapping and location and service included, exactly like what
other people sell: every grocer, or every haberdasher, or every seller of
“Good Humors” on a road that is not simply lined with sellers of the same
brand of ice cream. This however is not what we mean when talking about
monopolists. We mean only those single sellers whose markets are not open
to the intrusion of would-be producers of the same commodity and of actual
producers of similar ones or, speaking slightly more technically, only those
single sellers who face a given demand schedule that is severely independent
of their own action as well as of any reactions to their action by other
concerns. The traditional Cournot-Marshall theory of monopoly as extended
and amended by later authors holds only if we define it in this way and there
is, so it seems, no point in calling anything a monopoly to which that theory
does not apply.
But if accordingly we do define it like this, then it becomes evident
immediately that pure cases of long-run monopoly must be of the rarest
occurrence and that even tolerable approximations to the requirements of
the concept must be still rarer than are cases of perfect competition. The
power to exploit at pleasure a given pattern of demand—or one that
changes independently of the monopolist’s action and of the reactions it
provokes—can under the conditions of intact capitalism hardly persist for
a period long enough to matter for the analysis of total output, unless
buttressed by public authority, for instance, in the case of fiscal
monopolies. A modern business concern not so protected—i.e., even if
protected by import duties or import prohibitions—and yet wielding that
power (except temporarily) is not easy to find or even to imagine. Even
railroads and power and light concerns had first to create the demand for
their services and, when they had done so, to defend their market against
competition. Outside the field of public utilities, the position of a single
seller can in general be conquered—and retained for decades—only on the
condition that he does not behave like a monopolist. Short-run monopoly
will be touched upon presently.
Why then all this talk about monopoly? The answer is not without interest
for the student of the psychology of political discussion. Of course, the
concept of monopoly is being loosely used just like any other. People speak
of a country’s having a monopoly of something or other 16 even if the
16 These so-called monopolies have of late come to the fore in connection with the proposal
to withhold certain materials from aggressor nations. The lessons of this discussion have some
bearing upon our problem by way of analogy. At first, much was thought of the possibilities of
that weapon. Then, on looking more closely at it, people found their lists of such materials to
be shrinking, because it became increasingly clear that there are very few things that cannot
he either produced or substituted for in the areas in question. And finally a suspicion began to
Can Capitalism Survive?100
industry in question is highly competitive and so on. But this is not all.
Economists, government agents, journalists and politicians in this country
obviously love the word because it has come to be a term of opprobrium
which is sure to rouse the public’s hostility against any interest so labeled.
In the Anglo-American world monopoly has been cursed and associated with
functionless exploitation ever since, in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, it was English administrative practice to create monopoly positions
in large numbers which, on the one hand, answered fairly well to the
theoretical pattern of monopolist behavior and, on the other hand, fully
justified the wave of indignation that impressed even the great Elizabeth.
Nothing is so retentive as a nation’s memory. Our time offers other and
more important instances of a nation’s reaction to what happened centuries
ago. That practice made the English-speaking public so monopoly-conscious
that it acquired a habit of attributing to that sinister power practically
everything it disliked about business. To the typical liberal bourgeois in
particular, monopoly became the father of almost all abuses—in fact, it
became his pet bogey. Adam Smith, 17 thinking primarily of monopolies of
the Tudor and Stuart type, frowned on them in awful dignity. Sir Robert
Peel—who like most conservatives occasionally knew how to borrow from
the arsenal of the demagogue—in his famous epilogue to his last period of
office that gave so much offense to his associates, spoke of a monopoly of
bread or wheat, though English grain production was of course perfectly
competitive in spite of protection. 18 And in this country monopoly is being
made practically synonymous with any large-scale business.
(b) The theory of simple and discriminating monopoly teaches that,
excepting a limiting case, monopoly price is higher and monopoly output
smaller than competitive price and competitive output. This is true
provided that the method and organization of production—and everything
else—are exactly the same in both cases. Actually however there are
superior methods available to the monopolist which either are not
dawn to the effect that even though some pressure can be exerted on them in the short run,
long-run developments might eventually destroy practically all that was left on the lists.
17 There was more excuse for that uncritical attitude in the case of Adam Smith and the
classics in general than there is in the case of their successors because big business in our sense
had not then emerged. But even so they went too far. In part this was due to the fact that they
had no satisfactory theory of monopoly which induced them not only to apply the term rather
promiscuously (Adam Smith and even Senior interpreted for instance the rent of land as a
monopoly gain) but also to look upon the monopolists’ power of exploitation as practically
unlimited which is of course wrong even for the most extreme cases.
18 This instance illustrates the way in which the term keeps on creeping into illegitimate
uses. Protection of agriculture and a monopoly of agrarian products are entirely different things.
The struggle was over protection and not over a non-existent cartel of either landowners or
farmers. But in fighting protection it was just as well to beat up for applause. And there was
evidently no simpler means of doing so than by calling protectionists monopolists
Monopolistic Practices 101
available at all to a crowd of competitors or are not available to them so
readily: for there are advantages which, though not strictly unattainable
on the competitive level of enterprise, are as a matter of fact secured only
on the monopoly level, for instance, because monopolization may
increase the sphere of influence of the better, and decrease the sphere of
influence of the inferior, brains, 19 or because the monopoly enjoys a
disproportionately higher financial standing. Whenever this is so, then
that proposition is no longer true. In other words, this element of the case
for competition may fail completely because monopoly prices are not
necessarily higher or monopoly outputs smaller than competitive prices
and outputs would be at the levels of productive and organizational
efficiency that are within the reach of the type of firm compatible with
the competitive hypothesis.
There cannot be any reasonable doubt that under the conditions of our
epoch such superiority is as a matter of fact the outstanding feature of
the typical large-scale unit of control, though mere size is neither
necessary nor sufficient for it. These units not only arise in the process
of creative destruction and function in a way entirely different from the
static schema, but in many cases of decisive importance they provide the
necessary form for the achievement. They largely create what they
exploit. Hence the usual conclusion about their influence on long-run
output would be invalid even if they were genuine monopolies in the
technical sense of the term.
Motivation is quite immaterial. Even if the opportunity to set monopolist
prices were the sole object, the pressure of the improved methods or of a
huge apparatus would in general tend to shift the point of the monopolist’s
optimum toward or beyond the competitive cost price in the above sense,
thus doing the work—partly, wholly, or more than wholly—of the
competitive mechanism,20 even if restriction is practiced and excess capacity
19 The reader should observe that while, as a broad rule, that particular type of superiority
is simply indisputable, the inferior brains, especially if their owners are entirely eliminated,
are not likely to admit it and that the public’s and the recording economists’ hearts go out to
them and not to the others. This may have something to do with a tendency to discount the
cost or quality advantages of quasi-monopolist combination that is at present as pronounced as
was the exaggeration of them in the typical prospectus or announcement of sponsors of such
combinations.
20 The Aluminum Company of America is not a monopoly in the technical sense as defined
above, among other reasons because it had to build up its demand schedule, which fact
suffices to exclude a behavior conforming to the Cournot-Marshall schema. But most
economists call it so and in the dearth of genuine cases we will for the purposes of this note
do the same. From 1890 to 1929 the price of the basic product of this single seller fell to
about 12 per cent or, correcting for the change in price level (B.L.S. index of wholesale
prices), to about 8.8 per cent. Output rose from 30 metric tons to 103,400. Protection by
patent ceased in 1909. Argument from costs and profits in criticism of this “monopoly” must
Can Capitalism Survive?102
is in evidence all along. Of course if the methods of production, organization
and so on are not improved by or in connection with monopolization as is
the case with an ordinary cartel, the classical theorem about monopoly price
and output comes into its own again. 21 So does another popular idea, viz.,
that monopolization has a soporific effect. For this, too, it is not difficult to
find examples. But no general theory should be built upon it. For, especially
in manufacturing industry, a monopoly position is in general no cushion to
sleep on. As it can be gained, so it can be retained only by alertness and
energy. What soporific influence there is in modern business is due to
another cause that will be mentioned later.
(c) In the short run, genuine monopoly positions or positions
approximating monopoly are much more frequent. The grocer in a village
on the Ohio may be a true monopolist for hours or even days during an
inundation. Every successful corner may spell monopoly for the moment.
A firm specializing in paper labels for beer bottles may be so
circumstanced—potential competitors realizing that what seem to be good
profits would be immediately destroyed by their entering the field—that it
can move at pleasure on a moderate but still finite stretch of the demand
curve, at least until the metal label smashes that demand curve to pieces.
New methods of production or new commodities, especially the latter, do
not per se confer monopoly, even if used or produced by a single firm. The
product of the new method has to compete with the products of the old ones
and the new commodity has to be introduced, i.e., its demand schedule has
to be built up. As a rule neither patents nor monopolistic practices avail
against that. But they may in cases of spectacular superiority of the new
device, particularly if it can be leased like shoe machinery; or in cases of
new commodities, the permanent demand schedule for which has been
established before the patent has expired.
Thus it is true that there is or may be an element of genuine monopoly
gain in those entrepreneurial profits which are the prizes offered by
capitalist society to the successful innovator. But the quantitative
importance of that clement, its volatile nature and its function in the
process in which it emerges put it in a class by itself. The main value to a
concern of a single seller position that is secured by patent or monopolistic
strategy does not consist so much in the opportunity to behave temporarily
take it for granted that a multitude of competing firms would have been about equally
successful in cost-reducing research, in the economical development of the productive
apparatus, in teaching new uses for the product and in avoiding wasteful breakdowns. This
is, in fact, being assumed by criticism of this kind, i.e., the propelling factor of modern
capitalism is being assumed away.
21 See however supra, § 1.
Monopolistic Practices 103
according to the monopolist schema, as in the protection it affords against
temporary disorganization of the market and the space it secures for long-
range planning. Here however the argument merges into the analysis
submitted before.
6. Glancing back we realize that most of the facts and arguments touched
upon in this chapter tend to dim the halo that once surrounded perfect
competition as much as they suggest a more favorable view of its alternative.
I will now briefly restate our argument from this angle.
Traditional theory itself, even within its chosen precincts of a stationary
or steadily growing economy, has since the time of Marshall and Edgeworth
been discovering an increasing number of exceptions to the old propositions
about perfect competition and, incidentally, free trade, that have shaken that
unqualified belief in its virtues cherished by the generation which flourished
between Ricardo and Marshall—roughly, J.S.Mill’s generation in England
and Francesco Ferrara’s on the Continent. Especially the propositions that a
perfectly competitive system is ideally economical of resources and allocates
them in a way that is optimal with respect to a given distribution of income—
propositions very relevant to the question of the behavior of output—cannot
now be held with the old confidence. 22
Much more serious is the breach made by more recent work in the field
of dynamic theory (Frisch, Tinbergen, Roos, Hicks and others). Dynamic
analysis is the analysis of sequences in time. In explaining why a certain
economic quantity, for instance a price, is what we find it to be at a given
moment, it takes into consideration not only the state of other economic
quantities at the same moment, as static theory does, but also their state at
preceding points of time, and the expectations about their future values. Now
the first thing we discover in working out the propositions that thus relate
quantities belonging to different points of time 23 is the fact that, once
equilibrium has been destroyed by some disturbance, the process of
establishing a new one is not so sure and prompt and economical as the old
theory of perfect competition made it out to be; and the possibility that the
very struggle for adjustment might lead such a system farther away from
instead of nearer to a new equilibrium. This will happen in most cases unless
the disturbance is small. In many cases, lagged adjustment is sufficient to
produce this result.
All I can do here is to illustrate by the oldest, simplest and most
22 Since we cannot enter into the subject, I will refer the reader to Mr. R.F. Kahn’s paper
entitled “Some Notes on Ideal Output” (Economic Journal for March 1935), which covers much
of this ground.
23 The term dynamics is loosely used and carries many different meanings. The above
definition was formulated by Ragnar Frisch.
Can Capitalism Survive?104
familiar example. Suppose that demand and intended supply are in
equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market for wheat, but that bad
weather reduces the crop below what farmers intended to supply. If price
rises accordingly and the farmers thereupon produce that quantity of
wheat which it would pay them to produce if that new price were the
equilibrium price, then a slump in the wheat market will ensue in the
following year. If now the farmers correspondingly restrict production,
a price still higher than in the first year may result to induce a still greater
expansion of production than occurred in the second year. And so on (as
far as the pure logic of the process is concerned) indefinitely. The reader
will readily perceive, from a survey of the assumptions involved, that no
great fear need be entertained of ever higher prices’ and ever greater
outputs’ alternating till doomsday. But even if reduced to its proper
proportions, the phenomenon suffices to show up glaring weaknesses in
the mechanism of perfect competition. As soon as this is realized much
of the optimism that used to grace the practical implications of the theory
of this mechanism passes out through the ivory gate.
But from our standpoint we must go further than that. 24 If we try to
visualize how perfect competition works or would work in the process of
creative destruction, we arrive at a still more discouraging result. This will
not surprise us, considering that all the essential facts of that process are
absent from the general schema of economic life that yields the traditional
propositions about perfect competition. At the risk of repetition I will
illustrate the point once more.
Perfect competition implies free entry into every industry. It is quite true,
within that general theory, that free entry into all industries is a condition
for optimal allocation of resources and hence for maximizing output. If our
economic world consisted of a number of established industries producing
familiar commodities by established and substantially invariant methods and
if nothing happened except that additional men and additional savings
combine in order to set up new firms of the existing type, then impediments
24 It should be observed that the defining feature of dynamic theory has nothing to do with
the nature of the economic reality to which it is applied. It is a general method of analysis rather
than a study of a particular process. We can use it in order to analyze a stationary economy,
just as an evolving one can be analyzed by means of the methods of statics (“comparative
statics”). Hence dynamic theory need not take, and as a matter of fact has not taken, any special
cognizance of the process of creative destruction which we have taken to be the essence of
capitalism. It is no doubt better equipped than is static theory to deal with many questions of
mechanism that arise in the analysis of that process. But it is not an analysis of that process
itself, and it treats the resulting individual disturbances of given states and structures just as it
treats other disturbances. To judge the functioning of perfect competition from the standpoint
of capitalist evolution is therefore not the same thing as judging it from the standpoint of
dynamic theory.
Monopolistic Practices 105
to their entry into any industry they wish to enter would spell loss to the
community. But perfectly free entry into a new field may make it impossible
to enter it at all. The introduction of new methods of production and new
commodities is hardly conceivable with perfect—and perfectly prompt—
competition from the start. And this means that the bulk of what we call
economic progress is incompatible with it. As a matter of fact, perfect
competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever
anything new is being introduced—automatically or by measures devised for
the purpose—even in otherwise perfectly competitive conditions.
Similarly, within the traditional system the usual indictment of rigid prices
stands all right. Rigidity is a type of resistance to adaptation that perfect and
prompt competition excludes. And for the kind of adaptation and for those
conditions which have been treated by traditional theory, it is again quite true
that such resistance spells loss and reduced output. But we have seen that
in the spurts and vicissitudes of the process of creative destruction the
opposite may be true: perfect and instantaneous flexibility may even produce
functionless catastrophes. This of course can also be established by the
general dynamic theory which, as mentioned above, shows that there are
attempts at adaptation that intensify disequilibrium.
Again, under its own assumptions, traditional theory is correct in holding
that profits above what is necessary in each individual case to call forth the
equilibrium amount of means of production, entrepreneurial ability included,
both indicate and in themselves imply net social loss and that business
strategy that aims at keeping them alive is inimical to the growth of total
output. Perfect competition would prevent or immediately eliminate such
surplus profits and leave no room for that strategy. But since in the process
of capitalist evolution these profits acquire new organic functions—I do not
want to repeat what they are—that fact cannot any longer be unconditionally
credited to the account of the perfectly competitive model, so far as the
secular rate of increase in total output is concerned.
Finally, it can indeed be shown that, under the same assumptions which
amount to excluding the most characteristic features of capitalist reality, a
perfectly competitive economy is comparatively free from waste and in
particular from those kinds of waste which we most readily associate with
its counterpart. But this does not tell us anything about how its account looks
under the conditions set by the process of creative destruction.
On the one hand, much of what without reference to those conditions
would appear to be unrelieved waste ceases to qualify as such when duly
related to them. The type of excess capacity for example that owes its
existence to the practice of “building ahead of demand” or to the practice
of providing capacity for the cyclical peaks of demand would in a regime
Can Capitalism Survive?106
of perfect competition be much reduced. But when all the facts of the case
are taken into consideration, it is no longer correct to say that perfect
competition wins out on that score. For though a concern that has to accept
and cannot set prices would, in fact, use all of its capacity that can produce
at marginal costs covered by the ruling prices, it does not follow that it would
ever have the quantity and quality of capacity that big business has created
and was able to create precisely because it is in a position to use it
“strategically.” Excess capacity of this type may—it does in some and does
not in other cases—constitute a reason for claiming superiority for a socialist
economy. But it should not without qualification be listed as a claim to
superiority of the perfectly competitive species of capitalist economy as
compared with the “monopoloid” species.
On the other hand, working in the conditions of capitalist evolution, the
perfectly competitive arrangement displays wastes of its own. The firm of
the type that is compatible with perfect competition is in many cases inferior
in internal, especially technological, efficiency. If it is, then it wastes
opportunities. It may also in its endeavors to improve its methods of
production waste capital because it is in a less favorable position to evolve
and to judge new possibilities. And, as we have seen before, a perfectly
competitive industry is much more apt to be routed—and to scatter the bacilli
of depression—under the impact of progress or of external disturbance than
is big business. In the last resort, American agriculture, English coal mining,
the English textile industry are costing consumers much more and are
affecting total output much more injuriously than they would if controlled,
each of them, by a dozen good brains.
Thus it is not sufficient to argue that because perfect competition is
impossible under modern industrial conditions—or because it always has
been impossible—the large-scale establishment or unit of control must be
accepted as a necessary evil inseparable from the economic progress which
it is prevented from sabotaging by the forces inherent in its productive
apparatus. What we have got to accept is that it has come to be the most
powerful engine of that progress and in particular of the long-run expansion
of total output not only in spite of, but to a considerable extent through, this
strategy which looks so restrictive when viewed in the individual case and
from the individual point of time. In this respect, perfect competition is not
only impossible but inferior, and has no title to being set up as a model of
ideal efficiency. It is hence a mistake to base the theory of government
regulation of industry on the principle that big business should be made to
work as the respective industry would work in perfect competition. And
socialists should rely for their criticisms on the virtues of a socialist economy
rather than on those of the competitive model.

CHAPTER IX
CLOSED SEASON
I T IS for the reader to decide how far the preceding analysis has attained
its object. Economics is only an observational and interpretative science
which implies that in questions like ours the room for difference of opinion
can be narrowed but not reduced to zero. For the same reason the solution
of our first problem only leads to the door of another which in an
experimental science would not arise at all.
The first problem was to find out whether there is, as I have put it (p. 72),
“an understandable relation” between the structural features of capitalism as
depicted by various analytic “models” and the economic performance as
depicted, for the epoch of intact or relatively unfettered capitalism, by the
index of total output. My affirmative answer to this question was based upon
an analysis that ran on lines approved by most economists up to the point
at which what is usually referred to as the modern tendency toward
monopolistic control entered the scene. After that my analysis deviated from
the usual lines in an attempt to show that what practically everyone concedes
to the capitalism of perfect competition (whether a theoretical construction,
or, at some time or other, a historical reality) must also to even a greater
degree be conceded to big-business capitalism. Since however we cannot put
the driving power and the engine into an experiment station in order to let
them perform under carefully controlled conditions, there is no way of
proving, beyond the possibility of doubt, their adequacy to produce just that
result, viz., the observed development of output. All we can say is that there
was a rather striking performance and that the capitalist arrangement was
favorable to producing it. And this is precisely why we cannot stop at our
conclusion but have to face another problem.
A priori it might still be possible to account for the observed performance
by exceptional circumstances which would have asserted themselves in any
institutional pattern. The only way to deal with this possibility is to examine
the economic and political history of the period in question and to discuss
such exceptional circumstances as we may be able to find. We will attack
the problem by considering those candidates for the role of exceptional
circumstances not inherent in the business processes of capitalism which
have been put up by economists or historians. There are five of them.
The first is government action which, though I quite agree with Marx in
Can Capitalism Survive?108
holding that politics and policies are not independent factors but elements
of the social process we are analyzing, may be considered as a factor external
to the world of business for the purposes of this argument. The period from
about 1870 to 1914 presents an almost ideal case. It would be difficult to
find another equally free from either the stimuli or the depressants that may
proceed from the political sector of the social process. The removal of the
fetters from entrepreneurial activity and from industry and trade in general
had largely been accomplished before. New and different fetters and
burdens—social legislation and so on—were being imposed, but nobody will
hold that they were major factors in the economic situation before 1914.
There were wars. But none of them was economically important enough to
exert vital effects one way or another. The Franco-German war that issued
in the foundation of the German Empire might suggest a doubt. But the
economically relevant event was after all the foundation of the Zollverein.
There was armament expenditure. But in the circumstances of the decade
ending in 1914 in which it assumed really important dimensions, it was a
handicap rather than a stimulus.
The second candidate is gold. It is very fortunate that we need not enter
into the thicket of questions that surrounds the modus operandi of the new
plethora of gold which burst forth from about 1890 on. For since in the first
twenty years of the period gold actually was scarce and since the rate of
increase in total output was then no smaller than it was later on, gold
production cannot have been a major factor in the productive performance
of capitalism whatever it might have had to do with prosperities and
depressions. The same holds true as regards monetary management which
at that time was not of an aggressive but rather of an adaptive type.
Third, there was the increase in population which, whether a cause or a
consequence of economic advance, certainly was one of the dominating factors
in the economic situation. Unless we are prepared to aver that it was wholly
consequential and to assume that any variation in output will always entail a
corresponding variation in population while refusing to admit the converse
nexus, all of which is of course absurd, that factor must be listed as an eligible
candidate. For the moment, a brief remark will suffice to clarify the situation.
A greater number of gainfully employed people will in general produce
more than a smaller number would whatever the social organization. Hence,
if any part of the actual rate of increase in population during that epoch can
be assumed—as of course it can—to have occurred independently of the
results produced by the capitalist system in the sense that it would have
occurred under any system, population must to that extent be listed as an
external factor. To the same extent, the observed increase in total output does
not measure, but exaggerates, capitalist performance.
Closed Season 109
Other things being equal, however, a greater number of gainfully
employed people will in general produce less per head of employed or of
population than a somewhat smaller number would whatever the social
organization. This follows from the fact that the greater the number of
workers, the smaller will be the amount of other factors with which the
individual worker cooperates. 1 Hence, if output per head of population is
chosen for measuring capitalist performance, then the observed increased is
apt to understate the actual achievement, because part of this achievement
has all along been absorbed in compensating for the fall in per capita output
that would have occurred in its absence. Other aspects of the problem will
be considered later on.
The fourth and fifth candidates command more support among economists
but can easily be dismissed as long as we are dealing with past performance.
The one is new land. The wide expanse of land that, economically speaking,
entered the Americo-European sphere during that period; the huge mass of
foodstuffs and raw materials, agricultural and other, that poured forth from
it; all the cities and industries that everywhere grew up on the basis proffered
by them—was this not a quite exceptional factor in the development of
output, in fact a unique one? And was not this a boon that would have
produced a vast access of wealth whatever the economic system it happened
to impinge upon? There is a school of socialist thought that takes this view
and in fact explains in this way the failure of Marx’s predictions about ever-
increasing misery to come true. The results of the exploitation of virgin
environments they hold responsible for the fact that we did not see more of
exploitation of labor; owing to that factor, the proletariat was permitted to
enjoy a closed season.
There is no question about the importance of the opportunities afforded
by the existence of new countries. And of course they were unique. But
“objective opportunities”—that is to say, opportunities that exist
independently of any social arrangement—are always prerequisites of
progress, and each of them is historically unique. The presence of coal and
iron ore in England or of petroleum in this and other countries is no less
important and constitutes an opportunity that is no less unique. The whole
capitalist process, like any other economic process that is evolutionary,
consists in nothing else but exploiting such opportunities as they enter the
businessman’s horizon and there is no point in trying to single out the one
under discussion in order to construe it as an external factor. There is less
reason for doing so because the opening up of these new countries was
1 This statement is far from satisfactory, but it seems to suffice for our purpose. The
capitalist part of the world taken as a whole had by then certainly developed beyond the limits
within which the opposite tendency is operative.
Can Capitalism Survive?110
achieved step by step through business enterprise and because business
enterprise provided all the conditions for it (railroad and power plant
construction, shipping, agricultural machinery and so on). Thus that process
was part and parcel of capitalist achievement and on a par with the rest.
Therefore the results rightfully enter our two per cent. Again we might
invoke the Communist Manifesto in support.
The last candidate is technological progress. Was not the observed
performance due to that stream of inventions that revolutionized the
technique of production rather than to the businessman’s hunt for profits?
The answer is in the negative. The carrying into effect of those technological
novelties was of the essence of that hunt. And even the inventing itself, as
will be more fully explained in a moment, was a function of the capitalist
process which is responsible for the mental habits that will produce
invention. It is therefore quite wrong—and also quite un-Marxian—to say,
as so many economists do, that capitalist enterprise was one, and
technological progress a second, distinct factor in the observed development
of output; they were essentially one and the same thing or, as we may also
put it, the former was the propelling force of the latter.
Both the new land and the technological progress may become
troublesome as soon as we proceed to extrapolation. Though achievements
of capitalism, they may conceivably be achievements that cannot be repeated.
And though we now have established a reasonable case to the effect that the
observed behavior of output per head of population during the period of full-
fledged capitalism was not an accident but may be held to measure roughly
capitalist performance, we are faced by still another question, viz., the
question to what extent it is legitimate to assume that the capitalist engine
will—or would if allowed to do so—work on in the near future, say for
another forty years, about as successfully as it did in the past.
111
CHAPTER X
THE VANISHING OF INVESTMENT
OPPORTUNITY
T HE nature of this problem can be most tellingly displayed against the
background of contemporaneous discussion. The present generation of
economists has witnessed not only a world-wide depression of unusual
severity and duration but also a subsequent period of halting and
unsatisfactory recovery. I have already submitted my own interpretation 1 of
these phenomena and stated the reasons why I do not think that they
necessarily indicate a break in the trend of capitalist evolution. But it is
natural that many if not most of my fellow economists should take a different
view. As a matter of fact they feel, exactly as some of their predecessors felt
between 1873 and 1896—though then this opinion was mainly confined to
Europe—that a fundamental change is upon the capitalist process. According
to this view, we have been witnessing not merely a depression and a bad
recovery, accentuated perhaps by anti-capitalist policies, but the symptoms
of a permanent loss of vitality which must be expected to go on and to
supply the dominating theme for the remaining movements of the capitalist
symphony; hence no inference as to the future can be drawn from the
functioning of the capitalist engine and of its performance in the past.
This view is being held by many with whom the wish is not father to the
thought. But we shall understand why socialists with whom it is, should have
with particular alacrity availed themselves of the windfall—some of them to
the point of shifting the base of their anti-capitalist argument completely to
this ground. In doing so, they reaped the additional advantage of being able
to fall back once more upon Marxian tradition which, as I have pointed out
before, the trained economists among them had felt compelled to discard
more and more. For, in the sense explained in the first chapter, Marx had
predicted such a state of things: according to him capitalism, before actually
breaking down, would enter into a stage of permanent crisis, temporarily
interrupted by feeble upswings or by favorable chance occurrences. Nor is
this all. One way of putting the matter from a Marxian standpoint is to stress
the effects of capital accumulation and capital agglomeration on the rate of
profits and, through the rate of profits, on the opportunity to invest. Since
1 See ch. V, p. 64.
Can Capitalism Survive?112
the capitalist process always has been geared to a large amount of current
investment, even partial elimination of it would suffice to make plausible the
forecast that the process is going to flop. This particular line in the Marxist
argument no doubt seems to agree well not only with some outstanding facts
of the past decade—unemployment, excess reserves, gluts in money markets,
unsatisfactory margins of profits, stagnation of private investment—but also
with several non-Marxist interpretations. There is surely no such gulf
between Marx and Keynes as there was between Marx and Marshall or
Wicksell. Both the Marxist doctrine and its non-Marxist counterpart are well
expressed by the self-explanatory phrase that we shall use: the theory of
vanishing investment opportunity. 2
It should be observed that this theory really raises three distinct problems.
The first is akin to the question that heads this part. Since nothing in the social
world can ever be aere perennius and since the capitalist order is essentially the
framework of a process not only of economic but also of social change, there is
not much room for difference about the answer. The second question is whether
the forces and mechanisms offered by the theory of vanishing investment
opportunity are the ones to stress. In the following chapters I am going to submit
another theory of what will eventually kill capitalism, but a number of
parallelisms will remain. There is however a third problem. Even if the forces
and mechanisms stressed by the theory of vanishing investment opportunity were
in themselves adequate to establish the presence in the capitalist process of a
long-run tendency toward ultimate deadlock, it does not necessarily follow that
the vicissitudes of the past decade have been due to them and—which it is
important to add for our purpose—that similar vicissitudes should therefore have
to be expected to persist for the next forty years.
For the moment we are mainly concerned with the third problem. But
much of what I am going to say also bears on the second. The factors that
are held to justify a pessimistic forecast concerning the performance of
capitalism in the near future and to negative the idea that past performance
may be repeated may be divided into three groups.
There are, first, the environmental factors. It has been stated and will have
to be established that the capitalist process produces a distribution of political
power and a socio-psychological attitude—expressing itself in corresponding
policies—that are hostile to it and may be expected to gather force so that
they will eventually prevent the capitalist engine from functioning. This
phenomenon I will set aside for later consideration. What follows now must
be read with the appropriate proviso. But it should be noted that that attitude
and cognate factors also affect the motive power of the bourgeois profit
2 See my Business Cycles, ch. xv.
The Vanishing of Investment Opportunity 113
economy itself, and that hence the proviso covers more than one might think
at first sight—more, at any rate, than mere “politics.”
Then there is the capitalist engine itself. The theory of vanishing
investment opportunity does not necessarily include, but as a matter of fact
is apt to be in alliance with, the other theory that modern largest-scale
business represents a petrified form of capitalism in which restrictive
practices, price rigidities, exclusive attention to the conservation of existing
capital values and so on are naturally inherent. This has been dealt with
already.
Finally, there is what may be described as the “material” the capitalist
engine feeds on, i.e., the opportunities open to new enterprise and
investment. The theory under discussion puts so much emphasis on this
element as to justify the label we have affixed to it. The main reasons for
holding that opportunities for private enterprise and investment are vanishing
are these: saturation, population, new lands, technological possibilities, and
the circumstance that many existing investment opportunities belong to the
sphere of public rather than of private investment.
1. For every given state of human wants and of technology (in the widest
possible sense of the term) there is of course for every rate of real wages a
definite amount of fixed and circulating capital that will spell saturation. If
wants and methods of production had been frozen for good at their state in
1800, such a point would have been reached long ago. But is it not
conceivable that wants may some day be so completely satisfied as to
become frozen forever after? Some implications of this case will presently
be developed, but so long as we deal with what may happen during the next
forty years we evidently need not trouble ourselves about this possibility.
If ever it should materialize, then the current decline in birth rate, still
more an actual fall in population, would indeed become an important factor
in reducing opportunities for investment other than replacement. For if
everyone’s wants were satisfied or nearly satisfied, increase in the number
of consumers would ex hypothesi be the only major source of additional
demand. But independently of that possibility, decrease in the rate of increase
in population does not per se endanger investment opportunity or the rate
of increase in total output per head. 3 Of this we can easily satisfy ourselves
by a brief examination of the usual argument to the contrary.
3 This also holds true for a small decline in absolute numbers of people such as may occur
in Great Britain before very long (see E.Charles, London and Cambridge Economic Service,
Memo. No. 40). A considerable absolute decline would raise additional problems. These we
shall neglect however because this cannot be expected to occur during the space: of time under
consideration. Still other problems, economic as well as political and socio-psychological, are
presented by the aging of a population. Though they are beginning to assert themselves
already—there is practically such a thing as a “lobby of the old”—we cannot enter into them
Can Capitalism Survive?114
On the one hand it is being held that a declining rate of increase in
total population ipso facto spells a declining rate of increase in output
and hence of investment because it restricts the expansion of demand.
This does not follow. Want and effective demand are not the same thing.
If they were, the poorest nations would be the ones to display the most
vigorous demand. As it is, the income elements set free by the falling
birth rate may be diverted to other channels and they are particularly apt
to be so diverted in all those cases in which the desire to expand
alternative demands is the very motive of childlessness. A modest
argument can indeed be made out by stressing the fact that the lines of
demand characteristic of an increasing population are particularly
calculable and thus afford particularly reliable investment opportunities.
But the desires that provide alternative opportunities are, in the given
state of satisfaction of wants, not much less so. Of course the prognosis
for certain individual branches of production, especially for agriculture,
is in fact not a bright one. But this must not be confused with the
prognosis for total output. 4
On the other hand, we might argue that the declining rate of increase in
population will tend to restrict output from the supply side. Rapid increase
was in the past frequently one of the conditions of the observed development
of output, and we might conclude a contrario that increasing scarcity of the
labor factor might be expected to be a limiting factor. However, we do not
hear much of this argument and for very good reasons. The observation that
at the beginning of 1940 output of manufacturing industry in the United
States was about 120 per cent of the average for 1923–1925 whereas factory
employment was at about 100 per cent supplies an answer that is adequate
for the calculable future. The extent of current unemployment; the fact that
with a falling birth rate women are increasingly set free for productive work
and that the falling death rate means prolongation of the useful period of life;
the unexhausted stream of labor-saving devices; the possibility, increasing
relatively to what it would be in the case of rapid increase of population, of
avoiding complementary factors of production of inferior quality (warding
off in part the operation of the law of diminishing returns)—all this gives
either. But it should be observed that, as long as retiring ages remain the same, the percentage
share of those who have to be provided for without contributing need not be affected by a
decreasing percentage of persons under fifteen.
4 There seems to be an impression, prevalent with many economists, to the effect that an
increase in population per se provides another source of demand for investment. Why—must
not all these new workmen be equipped with tools and their complement of raw material? This
however is by no means obvious. Unless the increase is allowed to depress wages, the
implication as to investment opportunity lacks motivation, and even in that case reduction of
investment per head employed would have to be expected.
The Vanishing of Investment Opportunity 115
ample support to Mr. Colin Clark’s expectation that product per man-hour
is going to rise during the next generation. 5
Of course, the labor factor may be made artificially scarce through high-
wage and short-hour policies and through political interference with the
discipline of the labor force. Comparison of the economic performance in
the United States and France from 1933 to 1940 with the economic
performance of Japan and Germany during the same years suggests in fact
that something of this kind has already occurred. But this belongs to the
group of environmental factors.
As my argument will abundantly show before long, I am very far indeed
from making light of the phenomenon under discussion. The falling birth rate
seems to me to be one of the most significant features of our time. We shall
see that even from a purely economic standpoint it is of cardinal importance,
both as a symptom and as a cause of changing motivation. This however is
a more complicated matter. Here we are concerned only with the mechanical
effects of a decreasing rate of increase in population and these certainly do
not support any pessimistic forecast as to the development of output per head
during the next forty years. As far as that goes, those economists who predict
a “flop” on this ground simply do what unfortunately economists have
always been prone to do: as once they worried the public, on quite
inadequate grounds, with the economic dangers of excessive numbers of
mouths to feed, 6 so they worry it now, on no better grounds, with the
economic dangers of deficiencies.
2. Next as to the opening up of new lands—that unique opportunity for
investment which cannot ever recur. Even if, for the sake of argument, we
grant that humanity’s geographical frontier is closed for good—which is not
in itself very obvious in view of the fact that at present there are deserts
where once there were fields and populous cities—and even if we further
grant that nothing will ever contribute to human welfare as much as did the
foodstuffs and raw materials from those new lands—which is more
plausible—it does not follow that total output per head must therefore
decline, or increase at a smaller rate, during the next half-century. This would
indeed have to be expected if the lands that in the nineteenth century entered
5 National Income and Outlay, p. 21.
6 Forecasts of future populations, from those of the seventeenth century on, were
practically always wrong. For this, however, there is some excuse. There may be even for
Malthus’s doctrine. But I cannot see any excuse for its survival. In the second half of the
nineteenth century it should have been clear to anyone that the only valuable things about
Malthus’s law of population are its qualifications. The first decade of this century definitely
showed that it was a bogey. But no less an authority than Mr. Keynes attempted to revitalise
it in the post-war period! And as late as 1925, Mr. H.Wright in his book on Population
spoke of “wasting the gains of civilization on a mere increase in numbers.” Will economics
never come of age?
Can Capitalism Survive?116
the capitalist sphere had been exploited in the sense that diminishing returns
would now be due to assert themselves. This however is not the case and,
as was just pointed out, the decreasing rate of increase in population removes
from the range of practical considerations the idea that nature’s response to
human effort either already is or must soon become less generous than it has
been. Technological progress effectively turned the tables on any such
tendency, and it is one of the safest predictions that in the calculable future
we shall live in an embarras de richesse of both foodstuffs and raw materials,
giving all the rein to expansion of total output that we shall know what to
do with. This applies to mineral resources as well.
There remains another possibility. Though the current output per head
of foodstuffs and raw materials need not suffer and may even increase, the
vast opportunities for enterprise and hence for investment that were
afforded by the task of developing the new countries seem to have vanished
with its completion and all sorts of difficulties are being predicted from
the resulting reduction of outlets for savings. We will assume again for the
sake of argument that those countries actually are developed for good and
that savings, failing to adapt themselves to a reduction of outlets, might
cause troubles and wastes unless other outlets open up instead. Both
assumptions are indeed most unrealistic. But there is no necessity for us
to question them because the conclusion as to the future development of
output is contingent upon a third one that is completely gratuitous, viz.,
the absence of other outlets.
This third assumption is simply due to lack of imagination and
exemplifies a mistake that very frequently distorts historical interpretation.
The particular features of a historic process that impress the analyst tend in
his mind to slip into the position of fundamental causes whether they have
a claim to that role or not. For instance, what is usually referred to as the
Rise of Capitalism roughly coincides with the influx of silver from the Potosi
mines and with a political situation in which the expenditure of princes
habitually outran their revenue so that they had to borrow incessantly. Both
facts are obviously relevant in a variety of ways to the economic
developments of those times—even peasants’ revolts and religious upheavals
may without absurdity be linked up with them. The analyst thereupon is apt
to jump to the conclusion that the rise of-the capitalist order of things is
causally connected with them in the sense that without them (and a few other
factors of the same type) the feudal world would have failed to transform
itself into the capitalist one. But this is really another proposition and one
for which there is, on the face of it, no warrant whatsoever. All that can be
averred is that this was the road by which events traveled. It does not follow
that there was no other. In this case, by the way, it cannot even be held that
The Vanishing of Investment Opportunity 117
those factors favored capitalist development for though they certainly did do
so in some respects they obviously retarded it in others.
Similarly, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, the opportunities for
enterprise afforded by the new areas to be exploited were certainly unique,
but only in the sense in which all opportunities are. It is gratuitous to assume
not only that the “closing of the frontier” will cause a vacuum but also that
“whatever steps into the vacant place must necessarily be less important in
any of the senses we may choose to give to that word. The conquest of the
air may well be more important than the conquest of India was—we must
not confuse geographical frontiers with economic ones.
It is true that the relative positions of countries or regions may
significantly change as one type of investment opportunity is replaced by
another. The smaller a country or region is and the more closely its fortunes
are wedded to one particular element in the productive process, the less
confidence we shall feel as to the future in store for it when that element is
played out. Thus agricultural countries or regions may lose permanently by
the competitive synthetic products (rayon, dyes, synthetic rubber for
instance), and it may be no comfort to them that, if the process be taken as
a whole, there may be net gain in total output. It is also true that the possible
consequences of this may be much intensified by the division of the
economic world into hostile national spheres. And it is finally true that all
we can assert is that the vanishing of the investment opportunities incident
to the development of new countries—if they are already vanishing—need
not cause a void that would necessarily affect the rate of increase in total
output. We cannot assert that they actually will be replaced by at least
equivalent ones. We may point to the fact that from that development further
developments naturally arise in those same countries or in others; we may
put some trust in the ability of the capitalist engine to find or create ever
new opportunities since it is geared to this very purpose; but such
considerations do not carry us beyond our negative result. And recalling our
reasons for embarking upon the subject, this is quite enough.
3. An analogous argument applies to the widely accepted view that the
great stride in technological advance has been made and that but minor
achievements remain. So far as this view does not merely render the
impressions conceived from the state of things during and after the world
crisis—when an apparent absence of novel propositions of the first
magnitude was part of the familiar pattern of any great depression—it
exemplifies still better than did the “closing of humanity’s frontier” that error
in interpretation economists are so prone to commit. We are just now in the
downgrade of a wave of enterprise that created the electrical power plant,
the electrical industry, the electrified farm and home and the motorcar. We
Can Capitalism Survive?118
find all that very marvelous, and we cannot for our lives see where
opportunities of comparable importance are to come from. As a matter of
fact however, the promise held out by the chemical industry alone is much
greater than what it was possible to anticipate in, say, 1880, not to mention
the fact that the mere utilization of the achievement of the age of electricity
and the production of modern homes for the masses would suffice to provide
investment opportunities for quite a time to come.
Technological possibilities are an uncharted sea. We may survey a
geographical region and appraise, though only with reference to a given
technique of agricultural production, the relative fertility of individual plots.
Given that technique and disregarding its possible future developments, we
may then imagine (though this would be wrong historically) that the best
plots are first taken into cultivation, after them the next best ones and so on.
At any given time during this process it is only relatively inferior plots that
remain to be exploited in the future. But we cannot reason in this fashion
about the future possibilities of technological advance. From the fact that
some of them have been exploited before others, it cannot be inferred that
the former were more productive than the latter. And those that are still in
the lap of the gods may be more or less productive than any that have thus
far come within our range of observation. Again this yields only a negative
result which even the fact that technological “progress” tends, through
systemization and rationalization of research and of management, to become
more effective and sure-footed, is powerless to turn into a positive one. But
for us the negative result suffices: there is no reason to expect slackening of
the rate of output through exhaustion of technological possibilities.
4. Two variants of this branch of the theory of vanishing investment
opportunity remain to be noticed. Some economists have held that the labor force
of every country had to be fitted out at some time or other with the necessary
equipment. This, so they argue, has been accomplished roughly in the course
of the nineteenth century. While it was being accomplished, it incessantly created
new demand for capital goods, whereas, barring additions, only replacement
demand remains forever after. The period of capitalist armament thus would turn
out to be a unique intermezzo after all, characterized by the capitalist economy’s
straining every nerve in order to create for itself the necessary complement of
tools and machines, and thus becoming equipped for the purpose of producing
for further production at a rate which it is now impossible to keep up. This is a
truly astounding picture of the economic process. Was there no equipment in
the eighteenth century or, in fact, at the time our ancestors dwelled in caves?
And if there was, why should the additions that occurred in the nineteenth
century have been more saturating than any that went before? Moreover,
additions to the armor of capitalism are as a rule competitive with the preexisting
The Vanishing of Investment Opportunity 119
pieces of it. They destroy the economic usefulness of the latter. Hence the task
of providing equipment can never be solved once for all. The cases in which
replacement reserves are adequate to solve it—as they normally would be in the
absence of technological change—are exceptions. This is particularly clear where
the new methods of production are embodied in new industries; obviously the
automobile plants were not financed from the depreciation accounts of railroads.
The reader will no doubt observe that even if we were able to accept the
premises of this argument, no pessimistic forecast about the rate of expansion
of total output would necessarily follow. On the contrary he might draw the
opposite inference, viz., that the possession of an extensive stock of capital
goods that acquires economic immortality through continuous renewal should
if anything facilitate further increase in total output. If so, he is quite right.
The argument rests entirely on the disturbance to be expected if an economy
geared to capital production faces a reduced rate of increase in the
corresponding demand. But this disturbance which is not of sudden occurrence
can easily be exaggerated. The steel industry for instance has not experienced
great difficulties in transforming itself from an industry that produced capital
goods almost exclusively into one that produces primarily durable consumers’
goods or semi-finished products for the production of durable consumers’
goods. And though compensation may not be possible within each existing
capital goods industry, the principle involved is the same in all cases.
The other variant is this. The great bursts of economic activity that used
to spread the symptoms of prosperity all over the economic organism have
of course always been associated with expansions of producers’ expenditure
that were in turn associated with the construction of additional plant and
equipment. Now some economists have discovered, or think they have
discovered, that at the present time new technological processes tend to
require less fixed capital in this sense than they used to in the past,
particularly in the epoch of railroad building. The inference is that spending
for capital construction will henceforth decrease in relative importance. Since
this will adversely affect those intermittent bursts of economic activity that
evidently have much to do with the observed rate of increase in total output,
it further follows that this rate is bound to decline, especially if saving goes
on at the old rate.
This tendency of new technological methods to become increasingly
capital-saving has not so far been adequately established. Statistical evidence
up to 1929—later data do not qualify for the purpose—point the other way.
All that the sponsors of the theory in question have offered is a number of
isolated instances to which it is possible to oppose others. But let us grant
that such a tendency exists. We have then the same formal problem before
us which exercised so many economists of the past in the case of labor-
Can Capitalism Survive?120
saving devices. These may affect the interests of labor favorably or adversely,
but nobody doubts that on the whole they are favorable to an expansion of
output. And this is—barring possible disturbances in the saving-investment
process which it is the fashion to exaggerate—no different in the case of
devices that economize outlay on capital goods per unit of the final product.
In fact, it is not far from the truth to say that almost any new process that is
economically workable economizes both labor and capital. Railroads were
presumably capital-saving as compared with the outlay that transportation,
by mailcoach or cart, of the same numbers of passengers and of the same
quantities of goods that actually are being transported by railroads now
would have involved. Similarly silk production by mulberry trees and
silkworms may be more capital-consuming—I don’t know—than the
production of an equivalent amount of rayon fabric would be. That may be
very sad for the owners of capital already sunk in the former. But it need
not even mean decrease of investment opportunity. It certainly does not
necessarily mean decrease in the expansion of output. Those who hope to
see capitalism break down solely by virtue of the fact that the unit of capital
goes further in productive effect than it used to, may have to wait long
indeed.
5. Finally, since the subject is usually dealt with by economists who aim
at impressing upon the public the necessity of governmental deficit spending,
another point never fails to turn up, viz., that such opportunities for
investment as remain are more suited for public than they are for private
enterprise. This is true to some extent. First, with increasing wealth certain
lines of expenditure are likely to gain ground which do not naturally enter
into any cost-profit calculation, such as expenditure on the beautification of
cities, on public health and so on. Second, an ever-widening sector of
industrial activity tends to enter the sphere of public management, such as
means of communication, docks, power production, insurance and so on,
simply because these industries become increasingly amenable to the
methods of public administration. National and municipal investment could
thus be expected to expand, absolutely and relatively, even in a thoroughly
capitalist society, just as other forms of public planning would.
But that is all. In order to recognize it we need not make any hypothesis
about the course of things in the private sector of industrial activity.
Moreover, for the purpose in hand it is immaterial whether in the future
investment and the incident expansion of output will to a greater or a lesser
extent be financed and managed by public rather than by private agencies
unless it be held in addition that public financing will impose itself because
private business would not be able to face the deficits to be expected in the
future from any investment. This however has been dealt with before.

CHAPTER XI
THE CIVILIZATION OF CAPITALISM
L EAVING the precincts of purely economic considerations, we now turn
to the cultural complement of the capitalist economy—to its socio-
psychological superstructure, if we wish to speak the Marxian language—
and to the mentality that is characteristic of capitalist society and in
particular of the bourgeois class. In desperate brevity, the salient facts may
be conveyed as follows.
Fifty thousand years ago man confronted the dangers and opportunities
of his environment in a way which some “prehistorians,” sociologists and
ethnologists agree was roughly equivalent to the attitude of modern
primitives.1 Two elements of this attitude are particularly important for us:
the “collective” and “affective” nature of the primitive mental process and,
partly overlapping, the role of what, not quite correctly, I shall here call
magic. By the first I designate the fact that in small and undifferentiated or
not much differentiated social groups collective ideas impose themselves
much more stringently on the individual mind than they do in big and
complex groups; and that conclusions and decisions are arrived at by
methods which for our purpose may be characterized by a negative criterion:
the disregard of what we call logic and, in particular, of the rule that excludes
contradiction. By the second I designate the use of a set of beliefs which are
not indeed completely divorced from experience—no magic device can
survive an unbroken sequence of failures—but which insert, into the
sequence of observed phenomena, entities or influences derived from non-
empirical sources. 2 The similarity of this type of mental process with the
1 Research of this type goes far back. But I believe that a new stage of it ought to be dated
from the works of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl. See in particular his Fonctions mentales dans les sociétés
inférieures (1909) and Le surnaturel et la nature dans la mentalité primitive (1931). There is a
long way between the position held in the first and the position held in the second work, the
milestones of which are discernible in Mentalité primitive (1921) and L’ame primitive (1927).
For us, Lévy-Bruhl is a particularly useful authority because he fully shares our thesis—in fact
his work starts from it—that the “executive” functions of thinking and the mental structure of
man are determined, partly at least, by the structure of the society within which they develop.
It is immaterial that, with Lévy-Bruhl, this principle hails not from Marx but from Comte.
2 A friendly critic of the above passage expostulated with me on the ground that I could
not possibly mean what it says because in that case I should have to call the physicist’s “force”
a magic device. That is precisely what I do mean, unless it is agreed that the term Force is
merely a name for a constant times the second time derivative of displacement. See the next
but one sentence in the text.
Can Capitalism Survive?122
mental processes of neurotics has been pointed out by G.Dromard (1911; his
term, délire d’interpretation, is particularly suggestive) and S.Freud (Totem
und Tabu, 1913). But it does not follow that it is foreign to the mind of
normal man of our own time. On the contrary, any discussion of political
issues may convince the reader that a large and—for action—most important
body of our own processes is of exactly the same nature.
Rational thought or behavior and a rationalistic civilization therefore do
not imply absence of the criteria mentioned but only a slow though incessant
widening of the sector of social life within which individuals or groups go
about dealing with a given situation, first, by trying to make the best of it
more or less—never wholly—according to their own lights; second, by doing
so according to those rules of consistency which we call logic; and third, by
doing so on assumptions which satisfy two conditions: that their number be
a minimum and that every one of them be amenable to expression in terms
of potential experience. 3
All this is very inadequate of course but it suffices for our purpose. There
is however one more point about the concept of rationalist civilizations that
I will mention here for future reference. When the habit of rational analysis
of, and rational behavior in, the daily tasks of life has gone far enough, it
turns back upon the mass of collective ideas and criticizes and to some extent
“rationalizes” them by way of such questions as why there should be kings
and popes or subordination or tithes or property. Incidentally, it is important
to notice that, while most of us would accept such an attitude as the symptom
of a “higher stage” of mental development, this value judgment is not
necessarily and in every sense borne out by the results. The rationalist
attitude may go to work with information and technique so inadequate that
actions—and especially a general surgical propensity—induced by it may,
to an observer of a later period, appear to be, even from a purely intellectual
standpoint, inferior to the actions and anti-surgical propensities associated
with attitudes that at the time most people felt inclined to attribute to a low
I.Q. A large part of the political thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries illustrates this ever-forgotten truth. Not only in depth of social
vision but also in logical analysis later “conservative” countercriticism was
clearly superior although it would have been a mere matter of laughter for
the writers of the enlightenment.
Now the rational attitude presumably forced itself on the human mind
primarily from economic necessity; it is the everyday economic task to which
we as a race owe our elementary training in rational thought and behavior—
I have no hesitation in saying that all logic is derived from the pattern of
3 This Kantian phrase has been chosen in order to guard against an obvious
objection.
The Civilization of Capitalism 123
the economic decision or, to use a pet phrase of mine, that the economic
pattern is the matrix of logic. This seems plausible for the following reason.
Suppose that some “primitive” man uses that most elementary of all
machines, already appreciated by our gorilla cousins, a stick, and that this
stick breaks in his hand. If he tries to remedy the damage by reciting a magic
formula—he might for instance murmur Supply and Demand or Planning
and Control in the expectation that if he repeats this exactly nine times the
two fragments will unite again—then he is within the precincts of pre-
rational thought. If he gropes for the best way to join the fragments or to
procure another stick, he is being rational in our sense. Both attitudes are
possible of course. But it stands to reason that in this and most other
economic actions the failure of a magic formula to work will be much more
obvious than could be any failure of a formula that was to make our man
victorious in combat or lucky in love or to lift a load of guilt from his
conscience. This is due to the inexorable definiteness and, in most cases, the
quantitative character that distinguish the economic from other spheres of
human action, perhaps also to the unemotional drabness of the unending
rhythm of economic wants and satisfactions. Once hammered in, the rational
habit spreads under the pedagogic influence of favorable experiences to the
other spheres and there also opens eyes for that amazing thing, the Fact.
This process is independent of any particular garb, hence also of the
capitalistic garb, of economic activity. So is the profit motive and self-
interest. Pre-capitalist man is in fact no less “grabbing” than capitalist man.
Peasant serfs for instance or warrior lords assert their self-interest with a
brutal energy all their own. But capitalism develops rationality and adds a
new edge to it in two interconnected ways.
First it exalts the monetary unit—not itself a creation of capitalism—into
a unit of account. That is to say, capitalist practice turns the unit of money
into a tool of rational cost-profit calculations, of which the towering
monument is double-entry bookkeeping. 4 Without going into this, we will
notice that, primarily a product of the evolution of economic rationality, the
cost-profit calculus in turn reacts upon that rationality; by crystallizing and
defining numerically, it powerfully propels the logic of enterprise. And thus
defined and quantified for the economic sector, this type of logic or attitude
4 This element has been stressed, and more suo overstressed, by Sombart. Double-entry
bookkeeping is the last step on a long and tortuous road. Its immediate predecessor was the
practice of making up from time to time an inventory and figuring out profit or loss; see
A.Sapori in Biblioteca Storica Toscana, VII. 1932. Luca Pacioli’s treatise on bookkeeping, 1494,
supplies by its date an important milestone. For the history and sociology of the state it is a
vital fact to notice that rational bookkeeping did not intrude into the management of public
funds until the eighteenth century and that even then it did so imperfectly and in the primitive
form of “cameralist” bookkeeping.
Can Capitalism Survive?124
or method then starts upon its conqueror’s career subjugating—
rationalizing—man’s tools and philosophies, his medical practice, his picture
of the cosmos, his outlook on life, everything in fact including his concepts
of beauty and justice and his spiritual ambitions.
In this respect it is highly significant that modern mathematico-
experimental science developed, in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, not only along with the social process usually referred to as the
Rise of Capitalism, but also outside of the fortress of scholastic thought and
in the face of its contemptuous hostility. In the fifteenth century mathematics
was mainly concerned with questions of commercial arithmetic and the
problems of the architect. The utilitarian mechanical device, invented by men
of the craftsman type, stood at the source of modern physics. The rugged
individualism of Galileo was the individualism of the rising capitalist class.
The surgeon began to rise above the midwife and the barber. The artist who
at the same time was an engineer and an entrepreneur—the type
immortalized by such men as Vinci, Alberti, Cellini; even Dürer busied
himself with plans for fortifications—illustrates best of all what I mean. By
cursing it all, scholastic professors in the Italian universities showed more
sense than we give them credit for. The trouble was not with individual
unorthodox propositions. Any decent schoolman could be trusted to twist his
texts so as to fit the Copernican system. But those professors quite rightly
sensed the spirit behind such exploits—the spirit of rationalist individualism,
the spirit generated by rising capitalism.
Second, rising capitalism produced not only the mental attitude of modern
science, the attitude that consists in asking certain questions and in going
about answering them in a certain way, but also the men and the means. By
breaking up the feudal environment and disturbing the intellectual peace of
manor and village (though there always was, of course, plenty to discuss and
to fall out about in a convent), but especially by creating the social space
for a new class that stood upon individual achievement in the economic field,
it in turn attracted to that field the strong wills and the strong intellects.
Precapitalist economic life left no scope for achievement that would carry
over class boundaries or, to put it differently, be adequate to create social
positions comparable to those of the members of the then ruling classes. Not
that it precluded ascent in general. 5 But business activity was, broadly
speaking, essentially subordinate, even at the peak of success within the craft
guild, and it hardly ever led out of it. The main avenues to advancement and
large gain were the church—nearly as accessible throughout the Middle Ages
5 We are too prone to look upon the medieval social structure as static or rigid. As a matter
of fact, there was an incessant—to use Pareto’s term—circulation des aristocracies. The
elements that composed the uppermost stratum around 900 had practically disappeared by 1500.
The Civilization of Capitalism 125
as it is now—to which we may add the chanceries of the great territorial
magnates, and the hierarchy of warrior lords—quite accessible to every man
who was physically and psychically fit until about the middle of the twelfth
century, and not quite inaccessible thereafter. It was only when capitalist
enterprise—first commercial and financial, then mining, finally industrial—
unfolded its possibilities that supernormal ability and ambition began to turn
to business as a third avenue. Success was quick and conspicuous, but it has
been much exaggerated as regards the social weight it carried at first. If we
look closely at the career of Jacob Fugger, for instance, or of Agostino Chigi,
we easily satisfy ourselves that they had very little to do with steering the
policies of Charles V or of Pope Leo X and that they paid heavily for such
privileges as they enjoyed. 6 Yet entrepreneurial success was fascinating
enough for everyone excepting the highest strata of feudal society to draw
most of the best brains and thus to generate further success—to generate
additional steam for the rationalist engine. So, in this sense, capitalism—and
not merely economic activity in general—has after all been the propelling
force of the rationalization of human behavior.
And now we are at long last face to face with the immediate goal 7 to
which that complex yet inadequate argument was to lead. Not only the
modern mechanized plant and the volume of the output that pours forth from
it, not only modern technology and economic organization, but all the
features and achievements of modern civilization are, directly or indirectly,
the products of the capitalist process. They must be included in any balance
sheet of it and in any verdict about its deeds or misdeeds.
There is the growth of rational science and the long list of its applications.
Airplanes, refrigerators, television and that sort of thing are immediately
recognizable as results of the profit economy. But although the modern
hospital is not as a rule operated for profit, it is nonetheless the product of
capitalism not only, to repeat, because the capitalist process supplies the
means and the will, but much more fundamentally because capitalist
rationality supplied the habits of mind that evolved the methods used in these
hospitals. And the victories, not yet completely won but in the offing, over
cancer, syphilis and tuberculosis will be as much capitalist achievements as
6 The Medici are not really an exception. For though their wealth helped them to acquire
control of the Florentine commonwealth, it was this control and not the wealth per se which
accounts for the role played by the family. In any case they are the only merchants that ever
rose to a footing of equality with the uppermost stratum of the feudal world. Real exceptions
we find only where capitalist evolution created an environment or completely broke up the
feudal stratum—in Venice and in the Netherlands for instance.

stead also for other purposes. It is in fact fundamental for any serious discussion of the great
theme of Capitalism and Socialism.

motorcars or pipe lines or Bessemer steel have been. In the case of medicine,
there is a capitalist profession behind the methods, capitalist both because
to a large extent it works in a business spirit and because it is an emulsion
of the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie. But even if that were not so,
modern medicine and hygiene would still be by-products of the capitalist
process just as is modern education.
There is the capitalist art and the capitalist style of life. If we limit
ourselves to painting as an example, both for brevity’s sake and because in
that field my ignorance is slightly less complete than it is in others, and if
(wrongly, as I think) we agree to start an epoch with Giotto’s Arena frescoes
and then follow the line (nothing short of damnable though such “linear”
arguments are) Giotto—Masaccio—Vinci—Michelangelo—Greco, no
amount of emphasis on mystical ardors in the case of Greco can obliterate
my point for anyone who has eyes that see. And Vinci’s experiments are
offered to doubters who wish, as it were, to touch the capitalist rationality
with their fingertips. This line if projected (yes, I know) could be made to
land us (though perhaps gasping) in the contrast between Delacroix and
Ingres. Well, and there we are; Cézanne, Van Gogh, Picasso or Matisse will
do the rest. Expressionist liquidation of the object forms an admirably logical
conclusion. The story of the capitalist novel (culminating in the Goncourt
novel: “documents written up”) would illustrate still better. But that is
obvious. The evolution of the capitalist style of life could be easily—and
perhaps most tellingly—described in terms of the genesis of the modern
lounge suit.
There is finally all that may be grouped around the symbolic centerpiece
of Gladstonian liberalism. The term Individualist Democracy would do just
as well—better in fact because we want to cover some things that Gladstone
would not have approved and a moral and spiritual attitude which, dwelling
in the citadel of faith, he actually hated. At that I could leave this point if
radical liturgy did not consist largely in picturesque denials of what I mean
to convey. Radicals may insist that the masses are crying for salvation from
intolerable sufferings and rattling their chains in darkness and despair, but
of course there never was so much personal freedom of mind and body for
all, never so much readiness to bear with and even to finance the mortal
enemies of the leading class, never so much active sympathy with real and
faked sufferings, never so much readiness to accept burdens, as there is in
modern capitalist society; and whatever democracy there was, outside of
peasant communities, developed historically in the wake of both modern and
ancient capitalism. Again plenty of facts can be adduced from the past to
make up a counterargument that will be effective but is irrelevant in a
discussion of present condi tions and future alternatives.8 If we do decide to
The Civilization of Capitalism 127
embark upon historical disquisition at all, then even many of those facts
which to radical critics may seem to be the most eligible ones for their
purpose will often look differently if viewed in the light of a comparison
with the corresponding facts of pre-capitalist experience. And it cannot be
replied that “those were different times.” For it is precisely the capi talist
process that made the difference.
Two points in particular must be mentioned. I have pointed out before that
social legislation or, more generally, institutional change for the benefit of the
masses is not simply something which has been forced upon capitalist society
by an ineluctable necessity to alleviate the ever-deepening misery of the poor
but that, besides raising the standard of living of the masses by virtue of its
automatic effects, the capitalist process also provided for that legislation the
means “and the will.” The words in quotes require further explanation that is
to be found in the principle of spreading rationality. The capitalist process
rationalizes behavior and ideas and by so doing chases from our minds, along
with metaphysical belief, mystic and romantic ideas of all sorts. Thus it
reshapes not only our methods of attaining our ends but also these ultimate
ends themselves. “Free thinking” in the sense of materialistic monism, laicism
and pragmatic acceptance of the world this side of the grave follow from this
not indeed by logical necessity but nevertheless very naturally. On the one
hand, our inherited sense of duty, deprived of its traditional basis, becomes
focused in utilitarian ideas about the betterment of mankind which, quite
illogically to be sure, seem to withstand rationalist criticism better than, say,
the fear of God does. On the other hand, the same rationalization of the soul
rubs off all the glamour of super-empirical sanction from every species of
classwise rights. This then, together with the typically capitalist enthusiasm for
Efficiency and Service—so completely different from the body of ideas which
would have been associated with those terms by the typical knight of old—
breeds that “will” within the bourgeoisie itself. Feminism, an essentially
capitalist phenomenon, illustrates the point still more clearly. The reader will
realize that these tendencies must be understood “objectively” and that
therefore no amount of anti-feminist or anti-reformist talk or even of temporary
opposition to any particular measure proves anything against this analysis.
These things are the very symptoms of the tendencies they pretend to fight.
Of this, more in the subsequent chapters.
Also, capitalist civilization is rationalistic “and anti-heroic.” The two go
together of course. Success in industry and commerce requires a lot of
stamina, yet industrial and commercial activity is essentially unheroic in the
8 Even Marx, in whose time indictments of this kind were not anything like as absurd as
they are today, evidently thought it desirable to strengthen his case by dwelling on conditions
that even then were either past or visibly passing.
Can Capitalism Survive?128
knight’s sense—no flourishing of swords about it, not much physical
prowess, no chance to gallop the armored horse into the enemy, preferably
a heretic or heathen—and the ideology that glorifies the idea of fighting for
fighting’s sake and of victory for victory’s sake understandably withers in
the office among all the columns of figures. Therefore, owning assets that
are apt to attract the robber or the tax gatherer and not sharing or even
disliking warrior ideology that conflicts with its “rational” utilitarianism, the
industrial and commercial bourgeoisie is fundamentally pacifist and inclined
to insist on the application of the moral precepts of private life to
international relations. It is true that, unlike most but like some other features
of capitalist civilization, pacifism and international morality have also been
espoused in non-capitalist environments and by precapitalist agencies, in the
Middle Ages by the Roman Church for instance. Modern pacifism and
modern international morality are nonetheless products of capitalism.
In view of the fact that Marxian doctrine—especially Neo-Marxian
doctrine and even a considerable body of non-socialist opinion—is, as we
have seen in the first part of this book, strongly opposed to this proposition 9
it is necessary to point out that the latter is not meant to deny that many a
bourgeoisie has put up a splendid fight for hearth and home, or that almost
purely bourgeois commonwealths were often aggressive when it seemed to
pay—like the Athenian or the Venetian commonwealths—or that no
bourgeoisie ever disliked war profits and advantages to trade accruing from
conquest or refused to be trained in warlike nationalism by its feudal masters
or leaders or by the propaganda of some specially interested group. All I hold
is, first, that such instances of capitalist combativeness are not, as Marxism
has it, to be explained—exclusively or primarily—in terms of class interests
or class situations that systematically engender capitalist wars of conquest;
second, that there is a difference between doing that which you consider your
normal business in life, for which you prepare yourself in season and out of
season and in terms of which you define your success or failure, and doing
what is not in your line, for which your normal work and your mentality do
not fit you and success in which will increase the prestige of the most
unbourgeois of professions; and third, that this difference steadily tells—in
international as well as in domestic affairs—against the use of military force
and for peaceful arrangements, even where the balance of pecuniary
advantage is clearly on the side of war which, under modern circumstances,
is not in general very likely. As a matter of fact, the more completely
capitalist the structure and attitude of a nation, the more pacifist—and the
more prone to count the costs of war—we observe it to be. Owing to the
9 See our discussion of the Marxian theory of imperialism, Part I, ch. iv.
The Civilization of Capitalism 129
complex nature of every individual pattern, this could be fully brought out
only by detailed historical analysis. But the bourgeois attitude to the military
(standing armies), the spirit in which and the methods by which bourgeois
societies wage war, and the readiness with which, in any serious case of
prolonged warfare, they submit to non-bourgeois rule are conclusive in
themselves. The Marxist theory that imperialism is the last stage of capitalist
evolution therefore fails quite irrespective of purely economic objections.
But I am not going to sum up as the reader presumably expects me to.
That is to say, I am not going to invite him, before he decides to put his
trust in an untried alternative advocated by untried men, to look once more
at the impressive economic and the still more impressive cultural
achievement of the capitalist order and at the immense promise held out
by both. I am not going to argue that that achievement and that promise
are in themselves sufficient to support an argument for allowing the
capitalist process to work on and, as it might easily be put, to lift poverty
from the shoulders of mankind.
There would be no sense in this. Even if mankind were as free to choose
as a businessman is free to choose between two competing pieces of
machinery, no determined value judgment necessarily follows from the facts
and relations between facts that I have tried to convey. As regards the
economic performance, it does not follow that men are “happier” or even
“better off” in the industrial society of today than they were in a medieval
manor or village. As regards the cultural performance, one may accept every
word I have written and yet hate it—its utilitarianism and the wholesale
destruction of Meanings incident to it—from the bottom of one’s heart.
Moreover, as I shall have to emphasize again in our discussion of the
socialist alternative, one may care less for the efficiency of the capitalist
process in producing economic and cultural values than for the kind of
human beings that it turns out and then leaves to their own devices, free to
make a mess of their lives. There is a type of radical whose adverse verdict
about capitalist civilization rests on nothing except stupidity, ignorance or
irresponsibility, who is unable or unwilling to grasp the most obvious facts,
let alone their wider implications. But a completely adverse verdict may also
be arrived at on a higher plane.
However, whether favorable or unfavorable, value judgments about
capitalist performance are of little interest. For mankind is not free to choose.
This is not only because the mass of people are not in a position to compare
alternatives rationally and always accept what they are being told. There is
a much deeper reason for it. Things economic and social move by their own
momentum and the ensuing situations compel individuals and groups to
behave in certain ways whatever they may wish to do—not indeed by
Can Capitalism Survive?130
destroying their freedom of choice but by shaping the choosing mentalities
and by narrowing the list of possibilities from which to choose. If this is the
quintessence of Marxism then we all of us have got to be Marxists. In
consequence, capitalist performance is not even relevant for prognosis. Most
civilizations have disappeared before they had time to fill to the full the
measure of their promise. Hence I am not going to argue, on the strength of
that performance, that the capitalist intermezzo is likely to be prolonged. In
fact, I am now going to draw the exactly opposite inference.

CHAPTER XII
CRUMBLING WALLS
I. T HE O BSOLESCENCE O F T HE E NTREPRENEURIAL F UNCTION
I N OUR discussion of the theory of vanishing investment opportunity, a
reservation was made in favor of the possibility that the economic wants
of humanity might some day be so completely satisfied that little motive
would be left to push productive effort still further ahead. Such a state of
satiety is no doubt very far off even if we keep within the present scheme
of wants; and if we take account of the fact that, as higher standards of
life are attained, these wants automatically expand and new wants emerge
or are created, 1 satiety becomes a flying goal, particularly if we include
leisure among consumers’ goods. However, let us glance at that possibility,
assuming, still more unrealistically, that methods of production have
reached a state of perfection which does not admit of further improvement
A more or less stationary state would ensue. Capitalism, being essentially
an evolutionary process, would become atrophic. There would be nothing left
for entrepreneurs to do. They would find themselves in much the same
situation as generals would in a society perfectly sure of permanent peace.
Profits and along with profits the rate of interest would converge toward zero.
The bourgeois strata that live on profits and interest would tend to disappear.
The management of industry and trade would become a matter of current
administration, and the personnel would unavoidably acquire the characteristics
of a bureaucracy. Socialism of a very sober type would almost automatically
come into being. Human energy would turn away from business. Other than
economic pursuits would attract the brains and provide the adventure.
For the calculable future this vision is of no importance. But all the
greater importance attaches to the fact that many of the effects on the
structure of society and on the organization of the productive process that
we might expect from an approximately complete satisfaction of wants or
from absolute technological perfection can also be expected from a
development that is clearly observable already. Progress itself may be
mechanized as well as the management of a stationary economy, and this
mechanization of progress may affect entrepreneurship and capitalist society
1 Wilhelm Wundt called this the Heterogony of Aims (Heterogonie der Zwecke).
Can Capitalism Survive?132
nearly as much as the cessation of economic progress would. In order to see
this it is only necessary to restate, first, what the entrepreneurial function
consists in and, secondly, what it means for bourgeois society and the
survival of the capitalist order.
We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize
the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an
untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing
an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials
or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on. Railroad
construction in its earlier stages, electrical power production before the First
World War, steam and steel, the motorcar, colonial ventures afford spectacular
instances of a large genus which comprises innumerable humbler ones—down
to such things as making a success of a particular kind of sausage or
toothbrush. This kind of activity is primarily responsible for the recurrent
“prosperities” that revolutionize the economic organism and the recurrent
“recessions” that are due to the disequilibrating impact of the new products
or methods. To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct
economic function, first, because they lie outside of the routine tasks which
everybody understands and, secondly, because the environment resists in many
ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to
finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to
produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and
to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small
fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as
the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either
inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions which the enterprise
exploits. It consists in getting things done.
This social function is already losing importance and is bound to lose it
at an accelerating rate in the future even if the economic process itself of
which entrepreneurship was the prime mover went on unabated. For, on the
one hand, it is much easier now than it has been in the past to do things that
lie outside familiar routine—innovation itself is being reduced to routine.
Technological progress is increasingly becoming the business of teams of
trained specialists who turn out what is required and make it work in
predictable ways. The romance of earlier commercial adventure is rapidly
wearing away, because so many more things can be strictly calculated that
had of old to be visualized in a flash of genius.
On the other hand, personality and will power must count for less in
environments which have become accustomed to economic change—best
instanced by an incessant stream of new consumers’ and producers’ goods—
and which, instead of resisting, accept it as a matter of course. The resistance
Crumbling Walls 133
which comes from interests threatened by an innovation in the productive
process is not likely to die out as long as the capitalist order persists. It is,
for instance, the great obstacle on the road toward mass production of cheap
housing which presupposes radical mechanization and wholesale elimination
of inefficient methods of work on the plot. But every other kind of
resistance—the resistance, in particular, of consumers and producers to a new
kind of thing because it is new—has well-nigh vanished already.
Thus, economic progress tends to become depersonalized and
automatized. Bureau and committee work tends to replace individual action.
Once more, reference to the military analogy will help to bring out the
essential point.
Of old, roughly up to and including the Napoleonic Wars, generalship
meant leadership and success meant the personal success of the man in
command who earned corresponding “profits” in terms of social prestige.
The technique of warfare and the structure of armies being what they were,
the individual decision and driving power of the leading man—even his
actual presence on a showy horse—were essential elements in the strategical
and tactical situations. Napoleon’s presence was, and had to be, actually felt
on his battlefields. This is no longer so. Rationalized and specialized office
work will eventually blot out personality, the calculable result, the “vision.”
The leading man no longer has the opportunity to fling himself into the fray.
He is becoming just another office worker—and one who is not always
difficult to replace.
Or take another military analogy. Warfare in the Middle Ages was a very
personal affair. The armored knights practiced an art that required lifelong
training and every one of them counted individually by virtue of personal
skill and prowess. It is easy to understand why this craft should have become
the basis of a social class in the fullest and richest sense of that term. But
social and technological change undermined and eventually destroyed both
the function and the position of that class. Warfare itself did not cease on
that account. It simply became more and more mechanized—eventually so
much so that success in what now is a mere profession no longer carries that
connotation of individual achievement which would raise not only the man
but also his group into a durable position of social leadership.
Now a similar social process—in the last analysis the same social
process—undermines the role and, along with the role, the social position
of the capitalist entrepreneur. His role, though less glamorous than that of
medieval warlords, great or small, also is or was just another form of
individual leadership acting by virtue of personal force and personal
responsibility for success. His position, like that of warrior classes, is
threatened as soon as this function in the social process loses its importance,
Can Capitalism Survive?134
and no less if this is due to the cessation of the social needs it served than
if those needs are being served by other, more impersonal, methods.
But this affects the position of the entire bourgeois stratum. Although
entrepreneurs are not necessarily or even typically elements of that stratum from
the outset, they nevertheless enter it in case of success. Thus, though
entrepreneurs do not per se form a social class, the bourgeois class absorbs them
and their families and connections, thereby recruiting and revitalizing itself
currently while at the same time the families that sever their active relation to
“business” drop out of it after a generation or two. Between, there is the bulk
of what we refer to as industrialists, merchants, financiers and bankers; they are
in the intermediate stage between entrepreneurial venture and mere current
administration of an inherited domain. The returns on which the class lives are
produced by, and the social position of the class rests on, the success of this more
or less active sector—which of course may, as it does in this country, form over
90 per cent of the bourgeois stratum—and of the individuals who are in the act
of rising into that class. Economically and sociologically, directly and indirectly,
the bourgeoisie therefore depends on the entrepreneur and, as a class, lives and
will die with him, though a more or less prolonged transitional stage—eventually
a stage in which it may feel equally unable to die and to live—is quite likely to
occur, as in fact it did occur in the case of the feudal civilization.
To sum up this part of our argument: if capitalist evolution—“progress”—
either ceases or becomes completely automatic, the economic basis of the
industrial bourgeoisie will be reduced eventually to wages such as are paid
for current administrative work excepting remnants of quasi-rents and
monopoloid gains that may be expected to linger on for some time. Since
capitalist enterprise, by its very achievements, tends to automatize progress,
we conclude that it tends to make itself superfluous—to break to pieces
under the pressure of its own success. The perfectly bureaucratized giant
industrial unit not only ousts the small or medium-sized firm and
“expropriates” its owners, but in the end it also ousts the entrepreneur and
expropriates the bourgeoisie as a class which in the process stands to lose
not only its income but also what is infinitely more important, its function.
The true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who
preached it but the Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Rockefellers. This result may
not in every respect be to the taste of Marxian socialists, still less to the taste
of socialists of a more popular (Marx would have said, vulgar) description.
But so far as prognosis goes, it does not differ from theirs.
II. T HE D ESTRUCTION O F T HE P ROTECTING S TRATA
So far we have been considering the effects of the capitalist process upon
the economic bases of the upper strata of capitalist society and upon their
Crumbling Walls 135
social position and prestige. But effects further extend to the institutional
framework that protected them. In showing this we shall take the term in its
widest acceptance so as to include not only legal institutions but also
attitudes of the public mind and policies.
1. Capitalist evolution first of all destroyed, or went far toward destroying,
the institutional arrangements of the feudal world—the manor, the village, the
craft guild. The facts and mechanisms of this process are too familiar to detain
us. Destruction was wrought in three ways. The world of the artisan was
destroyed primarily by the automatic effects of the competition that came from
the capitalist entrepreneur; political action in removing atrophic organizations
and regulations only registered results. The world of the lord and the peasant
was destroyed primarily by political—in some cases revolutionary—action and
capitalism merely presided over adaptive transformations say, of the German
manorial organizations into large-scale agricul tural units of production. But
along with these industrial and agrarian revolutions went a no less
revolutionary change in the general attitude of legislative authority and public
opinion. Together with the old economic organization vanished the economic
and political privileges of the classes or groups that used to play the leading
role in it, particularly the tax exemptions and the political prerogatives of the
landed nobility and gentry and of the clergy.
Economically all this meant for the bourgeoisie the breaking of so many
fetters and the removal of so many barriers. Politically it meant the
replacement of an order in which the bourgeois was a humble subject by
another that was more congenial to his rationalist mind and to his immediate
interests. But, surveying that process from the standpoint of today, the
observer might well wonder whether in the end such complete emancipation
was good for the bourgeois and his world. For those fetters not only
hampered, they also sheltered. Before proceeding further we must carefully
clarify and appraise this point.
2. The related processes of the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie and of
the rise of national states produced, in the sixteenth, seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, a social structure that may seem to us amphibial though
it was no more amphibial or transitional than any other. Consider the
outstanding instance that is afforded by the monarchy of Louis XIV. The
royal power had subjugated the landed aristocracy and at the same time
conciliated it by proffering employment and pensions and by conditionally
accepting its claim to a ruling or leading class position. The same royal
power had subjugated and allied itself with the clergy. 2 It had finally
strengthened its sway over the bourgeoisie, its old ally in the struggle with
2 Gallicanism was nothing else but the ideological reflex of this.
Can Capitalism Survive?136
the territorial magnates, protecting and propelling its enterprise in order to
exploit it the more effectively in turn. Peasants and the (small) industrial
proletariat were likewise managed, exploited and protected by public
authority—though the protection was in the case of the French ancien régime
very much less in evidence than for instance in the Austria of Maria Theresa
or of Joseph II—and, vicariously, by landlords or industrialists. This was not
simply a government in the sense of nineteenth-century liberalism, i.e., a
social agency existing for the performance of a few limited functions to be
financed by a minimum of revenue. On principle, the monarchy managed
everything, from consciences to the patterns of the silk fabrics of Lyons, and
financially it aimed at a maximum of revenue. Though the king was never
really absolute, public authority was all-comprehensive.
Correct diagnosis of this pattern is of the utmost importance for our subject.
The king, the court, the army, the church and the bureaucracy lived to an
increasing extent on revenue created by the capitalist process, even purely
feudal sources of income being swelled in consequence of contemporaneous
capitalist developments. To an increasing extent also, domestic and foreign
policies and institutional changes were shaped to suit and propel that
development. As far as that goes, the feudal elements in the structure of the
so-called absolute monarchy come in only under the heading of atavisms
which in fact is the diagnosis one would naturally adopt at first sight.
Looking more closely, however, we realize that those elements meant
more than that. The steel frame of that structure still consisted of the human
material of feudal society and this material still behaved according to
precapitalist patterns. It filled the offices of state, officered the army, devised
policies—it functioned as a classe dirigente and, though taking account of
bourgeois interests, it took care to distance itself from the bourgeoisie. The
centerpiece, the king, was king by the grace of God, and the root of his
position was feudal, not only in the historical but also in the sociological
sense, however much he availed himself of the economic possibilities offered
by capitalism. All this was more than atavism. It was an active symbiosis of
two social strata, one of which no doubt supported the other economically
but was in turn supported by the other politically. Whatever we may think
of the achievements or shortcomings of this arrangement, whatever the
bourgeois himself may have thought of it at the time or later—and of the
aristocratic scapegrace or idler—it was of the essence of that society.
3. Of that society only? The subsequent course of things, best exemplified
by the English case, suggests the answer. The aristocratic element continued
to rule the roost right to the end of the period of intact and vital capitalism.
No doubt that element—though nowhere so effectively as in England—
currently absorbed the brains from other strata that drifted into politics; it
Crumbling Walls 137
made itself the representative of bourgeois interests and fought the battles
of the bourgeoisie; it had to surrender its last legal privileges; but with these
qualifications, and for ends no longer its own, it continued to man the
political engine, to manage the state, to govern.
The economically operative part of the bourgeois strata did not offer much
opposition to this. On the whole, that kind of division of labor suited them
and they liked it. Where they did revolt against it or where they got into the
political saddle without having to revolt, they did not make a conspicuous
success of ruling and did not prove able to hold their own. The question
arises whether it is really safe to assume that these failures were merely due
to lack of opportunity to acquire experience and, with experience, the
attitudes of a politically ruling class.
It is not. There is a more fundamental reason for those failures such as
are instanced by the French or German experiences with bourgeois attempts
at ruling—a reason which again will best be visualized by contrasting the
figure of the industrialist or merchant with that of the medieval lord. The
latter’s “profession” not only qualified him admirably for the defense of his
own class interest—he was not only able to fight for it physically—but it also
cast a halo around him and made of him a ruler of men. The first was
important, but more so were the mystic glamour and the lordly attitude—
that ability and habit to command and to be obeyed that carried prestige with
all classes of society and in every walk of life. That prestige was so great
and that attitude so useful that the class position outlived the social and
technological conditions which had given rise to it and proved adaptable, by
means of a transformation of the class function, to quite different social and
economic conditions. With the utmost ease and grace the lords and knights
metamorphosed themselves into courtiers, administrators, diplomats,
politicians and into military officers of a type that had nothing whatever to
do with that of the medieval knight. And—most astonishing phenomenon
when we come to think of it—a remnant of that old prestige survives even
to this day, and not only with our ladies.
Of the industrialist and merchant the opposite is true. There is surely no trace
of any mystic glamour about him which is what counts in the ruling of men.
The stock exchange is a poor substitute for the Holy Grail. We have seen that
the industrialist and merchant, as far as they are entrepreneurs, also fill a function
of leadership. But economic leadership of this type does not readily expand, like
the medieval lord’s military leadership, into the leadership of nations. On the
contrary, the ledger and the cost calculation absorb and confine.
I have called the bourgeois rationalist and unheroic. He can only use
rationalist and unheroic means to defend his position or to bend a nation to
his will. He can impress by what people may expect from his economic
Can Capitalism Survive?138
performance, he can argue his case, he can promise to pay out money or
threaten to withhold it, he can hire the treacherous services of a condottiere
or politician or journalist. But that is all and all of it is greatly overrated as
to its political value. Nor are his experiences and habits of life of the kind
that develop personal fascination. A genius in the business office may be,
and often is, utterly unable outside of it to say boo to a goose—both in the
drawing room and on the platform. Knowing this he wants to be left alone
and to leave politics alone.
Again exceptions will occur to the reader. But again they do not amount
to much. Aptitude for, and interest and success in, city management is the
only important exception in Europe, and this will be found to strengthen our
case instead of weakening it. Before the advent of the modern metropolis,
which is no longer a bourgeois affair, city management was akin to business
management. Grasp of its problems and authority within its precincts came
naturally to the manufacturer and trader, and the local interests of
manufacturing and trading supplied most of the subject matter of its politics
which therefore lent itself to treatment by the methods and in the spirit of
the business office. Under exceptionally favorable conditions, exceptional
developments sprouted from those roots, such as the developments of the
Venetian or Genoese republics. The case of the Low Countries enters into
the same pattern, but it is particularly instructive by virtue of the fact that
the merchants’ republic invariably failed in the great game of international
politics and that in practically every emergency it had to hand over the reins
to a warlord of feudal complexion. As regards the United States, it would
be easy to list the uniquely favorable circumstances—rapidly waning—that
explain its case. 3
4. The inference is obvious: barring such exceptional conditions, the
bourgeois class is ill equipped to face the problems, both domestic and
international, that have normally to be faced by a country of any importance.
The bourgeois themselves feel this in spite of all the phraseology that seems
to deny it, and so do the masses. Within a protecting framework not made
of bourgeois material, the bourgeoisie may be successful, not only in the
political defensive but also in the offensive, especially as an opposition. For
a time it felt so safe as to be able to afford the luxury of attacking the
protective frame itself; such bourgeois opposition as there was in imperial
Germany illustrates this to perfection. But without protection by some non-
bourgeois group, the bourgeoisie is politically helpless and unable not only
to lead its nation but even to take care of its particular class interest. Which
amounts to saying that it needs a master.
3 This line of reasoning will he taken up again in Part IV.
Crumbling Walls 139
But the capitalist process, both by its economic mechanics and by its
psycho-sociological effects, did away with this protecting master or, as in
this country, never gave him, or a substitute for him, a chance to develop.
The implications of this are strengthened by another consequence of the
same process. Capitalist evolution eliminates not only the king Dei Gratia
but also the political entrenchments that, had they proved tenable, would
have been formed by the village and the craft guild. Of course, neither
organization was tenable in the precise shape in which capitalism found it.
But capitalist policies wrought destruction much beyond what was
unavoidable. They attacked the artisan in reservations in which he could have
survived for an indefinite time. They forced upon the peasant all the
blessings of early liberalism—the free and unsheltered holding and all the
individualist rope he needed in order to hang himself.
In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism
thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying
buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its
relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional
deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis
with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. Having
discovered this fact which so many slogans obscure, we might well wonder
whether it is quite correct to look upon capitalism as a social form sui
generis or, in fact, as anything else but the last stage of the decomposition
of what we have called feudalism. On the whole, I am inclined to believe
that its peculiarities suffice to make a type and to accept that symbiosis of
classes which owe their existence to different epochs and processes as the
rule rather than as an exception—at least it has been the rule these 6000
years, i.e., ever since primitive tillers of the soil became the subjects of
mounted nomads. But there is no great objection that I can see against the
opposite view alluded to.
III. T HE D ESTRUCTION O F T HE I NSTITUTIONAL F RAMEWORK
O F C APITALIST S OCIETY
We return from our digression with a load of ominous facts. They are almost,
though not quite, sufficient to establish our next point, viz., that the capitalist
process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional
framework of feudal society also undermines its own.
It has been pointed out above that the very success of capitalist enterprise
paradoxically tends to impair the prestige or social weight of the class
primarily associated with it and that the giant unit of control tends to oust
the bourgeoisie from the function to which it owed that social weight. The
corresponding change in the meaning, and the incidental loss in vitality, of
Can Capitalism Survive?140
the institutions of the bourgeois world and of its typical attitudes are easy
to trace.
On the one hand, the capitalist process unavoidably attacks the economic
standing ground of the small producer and trader. What it did to the pre-
capitalist strata it also does—and by the same competitive mechanism—to
the lower strata of capitalist industry. Here of course Marx scores. It is true
that the facts of industrial concentration do not quite live up to the ideas the
public is being taught to entertain about it (see Chapter XIX). The process
has gone less far and is less free from setbacks and compensatory tendencies
than one would gather from many a popular exposition. In particular,
largescale enterprise not only annihilates but also, to some extent, creates
space for the small producing, and especially trading, firm. Also, in the case
of the peasants and farmers, the capitalist world has at last proved both
willing and able to pursue an expensive but on the whole effective policy of
conservation. In the long run, however, there can. be little doubt about the
fact we are envisaging, or about its consequences. Outside of the agrarian
field, moreover, the bourgeoisie has shown but little awareness of the
problem4 or its importance for the survival of the capitalist order. The profits
to be made by rationalizing the organization of production and especially by
cheapening the tortuous way of commodities from the factory to the ultimate
consumer are more than the mind of the typical businessman can resist.
Now it is important to realize precisely what these consequences consist
in. A very common type of social criticism which we have already met
laments the “decline of competition” and equates it to the decline of
capitalism because of the virtues it attributes to competition and the vices it
attributes to modern industrial “monopolies.” In this schema of
interpretation, monopolization plays the role of arteriosclerosis and reacts
upon the fortunes of the capitalist order through increasingly unsatisfactory
economic performance. We have seen the reasons for rejecting this view.
Economically neither the case for competition nor the case against
concentration of economic control is anything like as strong as this argument
implies. And, whether weak or strong, it misses the salient point. Even if the
giant concerns were all managed so perfectly as to call forth applause from
the angels in heaven, the political consequences of concentration would still
be what they are. The political structure of a nation is profoundly affected
by the elimination of a host of small and mediumsized firms the owner-
managers of which, together with their dependents, henchmen and
connections, count quantitatively at the polls and have a hold on what we
4 Although some governments did; the government of imperial Germany did much to fight
this particular kind of rationalization, and there is now a strong tendency to do the same in
this country.
Crumbling Walls 141
may term the foreman class that no management of a large unit can ever
have; the very foundation of private property and free contracting wears
away in a nation in which its most vital, most concrete, most meaningful
types disappear from the moral horizon of the people.
On the other hand, the capitalist process also attacks its own institutional
framework—let us continue to visualize “property” and “free contracting” as
partes pro toto—within the precincts of the big units. Excepting the cases that
are still of considerable importance in which a corporation is practically owned
by a single individual or family, the figure of the proprietor and with it the
specifically proprietary interest have vanished from the picture. There are the
salaried executives and all the salaried managers and submanagers. There are
the big stockholders. And then there are the small stockholders. The first group
tends to acquire the employee attitude and rarely if ever identifies itself with
the stockholding interest even in the most favorable cases, i.e., in the cases in
which it identifies itself with the interest of the concern as such. The second
group, even if it considers its connection with the concern as permanent and
even if it actually behaves as financial theory would have stockholders behave,
is at one remove from both the functions and the attitudes of an owner. As to
the third group, small stockholders often do not care much about what for most
of them is but a minor source of income and, whether they care or not, they
hardly ever bother, unless they or some representatives of theirs are out to
exploit their nuisance value; being often very ill used and still more often
thinking themselves ill used, they almost regularly drift into an attitude hostile
to “their” corporations, to big business in general and, particularly when things
look bad, to the capitalist order as such. No element of any of those three
groups into which I schematized the typical situation unconditionally takes the
attitude characteristic of that curious phenomenon, so full of meaning and so
rapidly passing, that is covered by the term Property.
Freedom of contracting is in the same boat. In its full vitality it meant
individual contracting regulated by individual choice between an indefinite
number of possibilities. The stereotyped, unindividual, impersonal and
bureaucratized contract of today—this applies much more generally, but a
potiori we may fasten upon the labor contract—which presents but restricted
freedom of choice and mostly turns on a c’est à prendre ou à laisser, has none
of the old features the most important of which become impossible with giant
concerns dealing with other giant concerns or impersonal masses of workmen
or consumers. The void is being filled by a tropical growth of new legal
structures—and a little reflection shows that this could hardly be otherwise.
Thus the capitalist process pushes into the background all those
institutions, the institutions of property and free contracting in particular, that
expressed the needs and ways of the truly “private” economic activity. Where
Can Capitalism Survive?142
it does not abolish them, as it already has abolished free contracting in the
labor market, it attains the same end by shifting the relative importance of
existing legal forms—the legal forms pertaining to corporate business for
instance as against those pertaining to the partnership or individual firm—
or by changing their contents or meanings. The capitalist process, by
substituting a mere parcel of shares for the walls of and the machines in a
factory, takes the life out of the idea of property. It loosens the grip that once
was so strong—the grip in the sense of the legal right and the actual ability
to do as one pleases with one’s own; the grip also in the sense that the holder
of the title loses the will to fight, economically, physically, politically, for
“his” factory and his control over it, to die if necessary on its steps. And this
evaporation of what we may term the material substance of property—its
visible and touchable reality—affects not only the attitude of holders but also
that of the workmen and of the public in general. Dematerialized,
defunctionalized and absentee ownership does not impress and call forth
moral allegiance as the vital form of property did. Eventually there will be
nobody left who really cares to stand for it—nobody within and nobody
without the precincts of the big concerns.
143
CHAPTER XIII
GROWING HOSTILITY
I. T HE S OCIAL A TMOSPHERE O F C APITALISM
FROM the analysis of the two preceding chapters, it should not be difficult
to understand how the capitalist process produced that atmosphere of
almost universal hostility to its own social order to which I have referred at
the threshold of this part. The phenomenon is so striking and both the
Marxian and the popular explanations are so inadequate that it is desirable
to develop the theory of it a little further.
1. The capitalist process, so we have seen, eventually decreases the
importance of the function by which the capitalist class lives. We have also
seen that it tends to wear away protective strata, to break down its own
defenses, to disperse the garrisons of its entrenchments. And we have finally
seen that capitalism creates a critical frame of mind which, after having
destroyed the moral authority of so many other institutions, in the end turns
against its own; the bourgeois finds to his amazement that the rationalist
attitude does not stop at the credentials of kings and popes but goes on to
attack private property and the whole scheme of bourgeois values.
The bourgeois fortress thus becomes politically defenseless. Defenseless
fortresses invite aggression especially if there is rich booty in them. Aggressors
will work themselves up into a state of rationalizing hostility 1 —aggressors
always do. No doubt it is possible, for a time, to buy them off. But this last
resource fails as soon as they discover that they can have all. In part, this
explains what we are out to explain. So far as it goes—it does not go the whole
way of course—this element of our theory is verified by the high correlation
that exists historically between bourgeois defenselessness and hostility to the
capitalist order: there was very little hostility on principle as long as the
bourgeois position was safe, although there was then much more reason for
it; it spread pari passu with the crumbling of the protecting walls.
2. But, so it might well be asked—in fact, so it is being asked in naïve
bewilderment by many an industrialist who honestly feels he is doing his
1 It is hoped that no confusion will arise from my using the verb “to rationalize” in two
different meanings. An industrial plant is being “rationalized” when its productive efficiency
per unit of expenditure is being increased. We “rationalize” an action of ours when we supply
ourselves and others with reasons for it that satisfy our standard of values regardless of what
our true impulses may be.
Can Capitalism Survive?144
duty by all classes of society—why should the capitalist order need any
protection by extra-capitalist powers or extra-rational loyalties? Can it not
come out of the trial with flying colors? Does not our own previous
argument sufficiently show that it has plenty of utilitarian credentials to
present? Cannot a perfectly good case be made out for it? And those
industrialists will assuredly not fail to point out that a sensible workman,
in weighing the pro’s and con’s of his contract with, say, one of the big
steel or automobile concerns, might well come to the conclusion that,
everything considered, he is not doing so badly and that the advantages
of this bargain are not all on one side. Yes—certainly, only all that is
quite irrelevant.
For, first, it is an error to believe that political attack arises primarily from
grievance and that it can be turned by justification. Political criticism cannot
be met effectively by rational argument. From the fact that the criticism of the
capitalist order proceeds from a critical attitude of mind, i.e., from an attitude
which spurns allegiance to extra-rational values, it does not follow that rational
refutation will be accepted. Such refutation may tear the rational gart of attack
but can never reach the extra-rational driving power that always lurks behind
it. Capitalist rationality does not do away with sub- or super-rational impulses.
It merely makes them get out of hand by removing the restraint of sacred or
semi-sacred tradition. In a civilization that lacks the means and even the will
to discipline and to guide them, they will revolt. And once they revolt it matters
little that, in a rationalist culture, their manifestations will in general be
rationalized somehow. Just as the call for utilitarian credentials has never been
addressed to kings, lords and popes in a judicial frame of mind that would
accept the possibility of a satisfactory answer, so capitalism stands its trial
before judges who have the sentence of death in their pockets. They are going
to pass it, whatever the defense they may hear; the only success victorious
defense can possibly produce is a change in the indictment. Utilitarian reason
is in any case weak as a prime mover of group action. In no case is it a match
for the extra-rational determinants of conduct.
Second, the success of the indictment becomes quite understandable as soon
as we realize what acceptance of the case for capitalism would imply. That
case, were it even much stronger than it actually is, could never be made
simple. People at large would have to be possessed of an insight and a power
of analysis which are altogether beyond them. Why, practically every nonsense
that has ever been said about capitalism has been championed by some
professed economist. But even if this is disregarded, rational recognition of the
economic performance of capitalism and of the hopes it holds out for the future
would require an almost impossible moral feat by the have-not. That
performance stands out only if we take a long-run view; any pro-capitalist
Growing Hostility 145
argument must rest on long-run considerations. In the short run, it is profits
and inefficiencies that dominate the picture. In order to accept his lot, the
leveler or the chartist of old would have had to comfort himself with hopes
for his great-grandchildren. In order to identify himself with the capitalist
system, the unemployed of today would have completely to forget his personal
fate and the politician of today his personal ambition. The long-run interests
of society are so entirely lodged with the upper strata of bourgeois society that
it is perfectly natural for people to look upon them as the interests of that class
only. For the masses, it is the short-run view that counts. Like Louis XV, they
feel après nous le déluge, and from the standpoint of individualist
utilitarianism they are of course being perfectly rational if they feel like that.
Third, there are the daily troubles and expectations of trouble everyone has
to struggle with in any social system—the frictions and disappointments, the
greater and smaller unpleasant events that hurt, annoy and thwart. I suppose
that every one of us is more or less in the habit of attributing them wholly to
that part of reality which lies without his skin, and emotional attachment to
the social order—i.e., the very thing capitalism is constitutionally unable to
produce—is necessary in order to overcome the hostile impulse by which we
react to them. If there is no emotional attachment, then that impulse has its
way and grows into a permanent constituent of our psychic setup.
Fourth, the ever-rising standards of life and particularly the leisure that
modern capitalism provides for the fully employed workman…well, there is
no need for me to finish the sentence or to elaborate one of the truest, oldest
and most stodgy of all arguments which unfortunately is but too true. Secular
improvement that is taken for granted and coupled with individual insecurity
that is acutely resented is of course the best recipe for breeding social unrest.
II. T HE S OCIOLOGY O F T HE I NTELLECTUAL
Nevertheless, neither the opportunity of attack nor real or fancied grievances
are in themselves sufficient to produce, however strongly they may favor, the
emergence of active hostility against a social order. For such an atmosphere
to develop it is necessary that there be groups to whose interest it is to work
up and organize resentment, to nurse it, to voice it and to lead it. As will be
shown in Part IV, the mass of people never develops definite opinions on its
own initiative. Still less is it able to articulate them and to turn them into
consistent attitudes and actions. All it can do is to follow or refuse to follow
such group leadership as may offer itself. Until we have discovered social
groups that will qualify for that role our theory of the atmosphere of hostility
to capitalism is incomplete.
Broadly speaking, conditions favorable to general hostility to a social
system or specific attack upon it will in any case tend to call forth groups that
Can Capitalism Survive?146
will exploit them. But in the case of capitalist society there is a further fact to
be noted: unlike any other type of society, capitalism inevitably and by virtue
of the very logic of its civilization creates, educates and subsidizes a vested
interest in social unrest.2 Explanation of this phenomenon, which is as curious
as it is important, follows from our argument in Chapter XI, but may be made
more telling by an excursion into the Sociology of the Intellectual.
This type is not easy to define. The difficulty is in fact symptomatic of
the character of the species. Intellectuals are not a social class in the sense
in which peasants or industrial laborers constitute social classes; they hail
from all the corners of the social world, and a great part of their activities
consist in fighting each other and in forming the spearheads of class interests
not their own. Yet they develop group attitudes and group interests
sufficiently strong to make large numbers of them behave in the way that is
usually associated with the con cept of social classes. Again, they cannot be
simply defined as the sum total of all the people who have had a higher
education; that would obliterate the most important features of the type. Yet
anyone who had—and, save exceptional cases, nobody who had not—is a
potential intellectual; and the fact that their minds are all similarly furnished
facilitates understanding between them and constitutes a bond. Nor would
it serve our purpose to make the concept coextensive with the membership
of the liberal professions; physicians or lawyers for instance are not
intellectuals in the relevant sense unless they talk or write about subjects
outside of their professional competence which no doubt they often do—
particularly the lawyers. Yet there is a close connection between the
intellectuals and the professions. For some professions—especially if we
count in journalism—actually do belong almost wholly to the domain of the
intellectual type; the members of all professions have the opportunity of
becoming intellectuals; and many intellectuals take to some profession for
a living. Finally, a definition by means of the contrast to manual labor would
be much too wide. 3 Yet the Duke of Wellington’s “scribbling set” seems to
be too narrow. 4 So is the meaning of hommes de lettres.
2 Every social system is sensitive to revolt and in every social system stirring up revolt is a
business that pays in case of success and hence always attracts both brain and brawn. It did in
feudal times—very much so. But warrior nobles who revolted against their superiors attacked
individual persons or positions. They did not attack the feudal system as such. And feudal
society as a whole displayed no tendencies to encourage—intentionally or unintentionally—
attacks upon its own social system as a whole.
3 To my sorrow, I have found that the Oxford English Dictionary does not list the meaning
I wish to attach to the term. It does give the turn of phrase “a dinner of intellectuals,” but in
connection with “superior powers of intellect” which points in a very different direction. I have
been duly disconcerted, yet have not been able to discover another term that would serve my
purpose equally well.
4 The Duke’s phrase occurs in The Croker Papers (ed. L.J.Jennings, 1884).
Growing Hostility 147
But we might do worse than take our lead from the Iron Duke. Intellectuals
are in fact people who wield the power of the spoken and the written word,
and one of the touches that distinguish them from other people who do the
same is the absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs. This touch in
general accounts for another—the absence of that first-hand knowledge of
them which only actual experience can give. The critical attitude, arising no
less from the intellectual’s situation as an onlooker—in most cases also as an
outsider—than from the fact that his main chance of asserting himself lies in
his actual or potential nuisance value, should add a third touch. The profession
of the unprofessional? Professional dilettantism? The people who talk about
everything because they understand nothing? Bernard Shaw’s journalist in The
Doctor’s Dilemma? No, no. I have not said that and I do not mean that. That
sort of thing would be still more untrue than it would be offensive. Let us give
up trying to define by words and instead define “epideiktically”: in the Greek
museum we can see the object, nicely labeled. The sophists, philosophers and
rhetors—however strongly they objected to being thrown together, they were
all of the same genus—of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. illustrate ideally
what I mean. That practically all of them were teachers does not destroy the
value of the illustration.
2. When analyzing the rationalist nature of capitalist civilization (Chapter
XI) I pointed out that the development of rational thought of course precedes
the rise of the capitalist order by thousands of years; all that capitalism did
was to give a new impulse and a particular bend to the process. Similarly—
leaving aside the Graeco-Roman world—we find intellectuals in thoroughly
pre-capitalist conditions, for instance in the Kingdom of the Franks and in
the countries into which it dissolved. But they were few in number; they
were clergy-men, mostly monks; and their written performance was
accessible to only an infinitesimal part of the population. No doubt strong
individuals were occasionally able to develop unorthodox views and even to
convey them to popular audiences. This however in general implied
antagonizing a very strictly organized environment—from which at the same
time it was difficult to get away—and risking the lot of the heretic. Even so
it was hardly possible without the support or connivance of some great lord
or chieftain, as the tactics of missionaries suffice to show. On the whole,
therefore, intellectuals were well in hand, and kicking over the traces was
no joke, even in times of exceptional disorganization and license, such as
during the Black Death (in and after 1348).
But if the monastery gave birth to the intellectual of the medieval world,
it was capitalism that let him loose and presented him with the printing press.
The slow; evolution of the lay intellectual was merely an aspect of this
process; the coincidence of the emergence of humanism with the emergence
Can Capitalism Survive?148
of capitalism is very striking. The humanists were primarily philologists
but—excellently illustrating a point made above—they quickly expanded into
the fields of manners, politics, religion and philosophy. This was not alone
due to the contents of the classic works which they interpreted along with
their grammar—from the criticism of a text to the criticism of a society, the
way is shorter than it seems. Nevertheless, the typical intellectual did not
relish the idea of the stake which still awaited the heretic. As a rule, honors
and comfort suited him a great deal better. And these were after all to be
had only from princes, temporal or spiritual, though the humanists were the
first intellectuals to have a public in the modern sense. The critical attitude
grew stronger every day. But social criticism—beyond what was implied in
certain attacks on the Catholic Church and in particular its head—did not
flourish under such conditions.
Honors and emoluments can however be had in more than one way.
Flattery and subservience are often less remunerative than are their opposites.
This discovery was not made by the Aretino 5 but no mortal ever surpassed
him in exploiting it. Charles V was a devoted husband but, during his
campaigns which kept him from home for many months at a time, he lived
the life of a gentleman of his time and class. Very well, the public—and what
particularly mattered to Charles, his empress—need never know, provided
arguments of the right kind and weight were duly handed to the great critic
of politics and morals. Charles paid up. But the point is that this was not
simple blackmail which in general benefits one party only and inflicts
uncompensated loss on the other. Charles knew why he paid though
doubtless it would have been possible to secure silence by cheaper if more
drastic methods. He did not display resentment. On the contrary he even
went out of his way to honor the man. Obviously he wanted more than
silence and, as a matter of fact, he received full value for his gifts.
3. In a sense, therefore, the Aretino’s pen was indeed stronger than the
sword. But, perhaps through ignorance, I do not know of comparable
instances of that type for the next hundred and fifty years, 6 during which
intellectuals do not seem to have played any great role outside and
independently of the established professions, mainly the law and the church.
Now this setback roughly coincides with the setback in capitalist evolution
which in most countries of continental Europe occurred in that troubled
period. And the subsequent recovery of capitalist enterprise was similarly
shared by the intellectuals. The cheaper book, the cheap newspaper or
pamphlet, together with the widening of the public that was in part their
5 Pietro Aretino, 1492–1556.
6 In England, however, the scope and importance of pamphleteering increased greatly in the
seventeenth century.
Growing Hostility 149
product but partly an independent phenomenon due to the access of wealth
and weight which came to the industrial bourgeoisie and to the incident
increase in the political importance of an anonymous public opinion—all
these boons, as well as increasing freedom from restraint, are by-products
of the capitalist engine.
In the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century the individual
patron was slow to lose the paramount importance in the intellectual’s
career that he had held at the beginning. But in the peak successes at
least, we clearly discern the growing importance of the new element—
the support of the collective patron, the bourgeois public. In this as in
every other respect, Voltaire affords an invaluable instance. His very
superficiality that made it possible for him to cover everything from
religion to Newtonian optics, allied to indomitable vitality and an
insatiable curiosity, a perfect absence of inhibitions, an unerring instinct
for and a wholesale acceptance of the humors of his time, enabled that
uncritical critic and mediocre poet and historian to fascinate—and to sell.
He also speculated, cheated, accepted gifts and appointments, but there
was always the independence founded on the solid base of his success
with the public. Rousseau’s case and type, though entirely different,
would be still more instructive to discuss.
In the last decades of the eighteenth century a striking episode displayed
the nature of the power of a free-lance intellectual who has nothing to work
with but the socio-psychological mechanism called Public Opinion. This
happened in England, the country that was then farthest advanced on the
road of capitalist evolution. John Wilkes’ attacks on the political system of
England, it is true, were launched under uniquely favorable circumstances;
moreover, it cannot be said that he actually upset the Earl of Bute’s
government which never had any chance and was bound to fall for a dozen
other reasons; but Wilkes’ North Briton was nevertheless the last straw that
broke…Lord Bute’s political back. No. 45 of the North Briton was the first
discharge in a campaign that secured the abolition of general warrants and
made a great stride toward the freedom of the press and of elections. This
does not amount to making history or to creating the conditions for a change
in social institutions, but it does amount to playing, say, the role of a
midwife’s assistant. 7 The inability of Wilkes’ enemies to thwart him is the
7 I do not fear that any historian of politics will find that I have exaggerated the importance
of Wilkes’ success. But I do fear objection to my calling him a free lance and to the implication
that he owed everything to the collective, and nothing to any individual patron. In his beginnings
he was no doubt encouraged by a coterie. On examination it will however be conceded, I think,
that this was not of decisive importance and that all the support and all the money and honors
he got afterwards were but a consequence of and tribute to previous success and to a position
independently acquired with the public.
Can Capitalism Survive?150
most significant fact about it all. They evidently had all the power of
organized government at their command. Yet something drove them back.
In France, the years preceding the revolution and the revolution itself
brought the rabble-raising tabloid (Marat, Desmoulins), which however did
not, like ours, completely jettison style and grammar. But we must hurry on.
The Terror and, more systematically, the First Empire put an end to this. Then
followed a period, interrupted by the rule of the roi bourgeois, of more or less
resolute repression that lasted until the Second Empire felt compelled to loosen
the reins—about the middle sixties. In central and southern Europe this period
also lasted about as long, and in England analogous conditions prevailed from
the beginning of the revolutionary wars to Canning’s accession to power.
4. How impossible it is to stem the tide within the framework of
capitalist society is shown by the failure of the attempts—some of them
prolonged and determined—made during that period by practically all
European governments to bring the intellectuals to heel Their histories
were nothing but so many different versions of Wilkes exploits. In
capitalist society—or in a society that contains a capitalist element of
decisive importance—any attack on the intellectuals must run up against
the private fortresses of bourgeois business which, or some of which, will
shelter the quarry. Moreover such an attack must proceed according to
bourgeois principles of legislative and administrative practice which no
doubt may be stretched and bent but will checkmate prosecution beyond
a certain point. Lawless violence the bourgeois stratum may accept or
even applaud when thoroughly roused or frightened, but only temporarily.
In a purely bourgeois regime like that of Louis Philippe, troops may fire
on strikers, but the police cannot round up intellectuals or must release
them forthwith; otherwise the bourgeois stratum, however strongly
disapproving some of their. doings, will rally behind them because the
freedom it disapproves cannot be crushed without also crushing the
freedom it approves.
Observe that I am not crediting the bourgeoisie with an unrealistic dose
of generosity or idealism. Nor am I unduly stressing what people think and
feel and want—on the importance of which I almost, though not quite, agree
with Marx. In defending the intellectuals as a group—not of course every
individual—the bourgeoisie defends itself and its scheme of life. Only a
government of non-bourgeois nature and non-bourgeois creed—under
modern circumstances only a socialist or fascist one—is strong enough to
discipline them. In order to do that it would have to change typically
bourgeois institutions and drastically reduce the individual freedom of all
strata of the nation. And such a government is not likely—it would not even
be able—to stop short of private enterprise.
Growing Hostility 151
From this follows both the unwillingness and the inability of the
capitalist order to control its intellectual sector effectively. The
unwillingness in question is unwillingness to use methods consistently
that are uncongenial to the mentality shaped by the capitalist process; the
inability is the inability to do so within the frame of institutions shaped
by the capitalist process and without submitting to non-bourgeois rule.
Thus, on the one hand, freedom of public discussion involving freedom
to nibble at the foundations of capitalist society is inevitable in the long
run. On the other hand, the intellectual group cannot help nibbling,
because it lives on criticism and its whole position depends on criticism
that stings; and criticism of persons and of current events will, in a
situation in which nothing is sacrosanct, fatally issue in criticism of
classes and institutions.
5. A few strokes will complete the modern picture. There are the
increasing means. There is the increase in the standard of life and in the
leisure of the masses that changed and is still changing the composition
of the collective patron for the tastes of whom the intellectuals have to
provide. There was and is the further cheapening of the book and
newspaper and the large-scale newspaper concern. 8 There is now the
radio. And there was and is the tendency toward complete removal of
restraints, steadily breaking down those short-run attempts at resistance
by which bourgeois society proves itself so incompetent and occasionally
so childish a disciplinarian.
8 The emergence and the career up to date of the large-scale newspaper concern illustrate
two points which I am anxious to stress: the manifold aspects, relations and effects of every
concrete element of the social pattern that preclude simple and one-way propositions, and the
importance of distinguishing short-run and long-run phenomena for which different, sometimes
opposite, propositions hold true. The large-scale newspaper concern is in most cases simply a
capitalist business enterprise. This does not imply that it espouses capitalist or any other class
interests. It may do so, but only from one or more of the following motives, the limited
importance of which is obvious: because it is subsidized by a capitalist group for the very
purpose of advocating its interests or views—the larger the concern and its sales, the less
important this element; because it intends to sell to a public of bourgeois tastes—this, very
important until about 1914, now increasingly cuts the other way; because advertisers prefer to
use a congenial medium—but mostly they take a very businesslike view of the matter; because
the owners insist on a certain course irrespective of their interest in sales—to a certain extent,
they do and especially did, but experience teaches that they do not hold out if the conflict with
their pecuniary interest in sales is too severe. In other words, the large-scale newspaper concern
is a most powerful tool for raising the position and increasing the influence of the intellectual
group, but it is even now not completely in its control. It means employment and a wider public,
but it also means “strings.” These are mainly of importance in the short run; in fighting for
greater freedom to do as he pleases, the individual journalist may easily meet defeat. But this
short-run aspect—and the group’s recollection of past conditions—are what enters the
intellectual’s mind and what determines the colors of the picture of slavery and martyrdom he
draws for the public. In reality, it should be a picture of conquest. Conquest and victory are in
this, as in so many other cases, a mosaic composed of defeats.
Can Capitalism Survive?152
There is, however, another factor. One of the most important fea tures
of the later stages of capitalist civilization is the vigorous expansion of the
educational apparatus and particularly of the facilities for higher education.
This development was and is no less inevitable than the development of
the largest-scale industrial unit, 9 but, unlike the latter, it has been and is
being fostered by public opinion and public authority so as to go much
further than it would have done under its own steam. Whatever we may
think of this from other standpoints and whatever the precise causation,
there are several consequences that bear upon the size and attitude of the
intellectual group.
First, inasmuch as higher education thus increases the supply of services
in professional, quasi-professional and in the end all “whitecollar” lines
beyond the point determined by cost-return considerations, it may create a
particularly important case of sectional unemployment.
Second, along with or in place of such unemployment, it creates
unsatisfactory conditions of employment—employment in substandard work
or at wages below those of the better-paid manual workers.
Third, it may create unemployability of a particularly disconcerting
type. The man who has gone through a college or university easily
becomes psychically unemployable in manual occupations without
necessarily acquiring employability in, say, professional work. His
failure to do so may be due either to lack of natural ability—perfectly
compatible with passing academic tests—or to inadequate teaching; and
both cases will, absolutely and relatively, occur more frequently as ever
larger numbers are drafted into higher education and as the required
amount of teaching increases irrespective of how many teachers and
scholars nature chooses to turn out. The results of neglecting this and
of acting on the theory that schools, colleges and universities are just
a matter of money, are too obvious to insist upon. Cases in which
among a dozen applicants for a job, all formally qualified, there is not
one who can fill it satisfactorily, are known to everyone who has
anything to do with appointments—to everyone, that is, who is himself
qualified to judge.
9 At present this development is viewed by most people from the standpoint of the ideal of
making educational facilities of any type available to all who can be induced to use them. This
ideal is so strongly held that any doubts about it are almost universally considered to be nothing
short of indecent, a situation not improved by the comments, all too often flippant, of
dissentients. Actually, we brush here against a set of extremely complex problems of the
sociology of education and educational ideals which we cannot attack within the limits of this
sketch. This is why I have confined the above paragraph to two incontestable and noncommittal
trivialities that are all we want for the purpose in hand. But of course they do not dispose of
the larger problems which must be left aside to testify to the incompleteness of my exposition.
Growing Hostility 153
All those who are unemployed or unsatisfactorily employed or
unemployable drift into the vocations in which standards are least definite
or in which aptitudes and acquirements of a different order count. They swell
the host of intellectuals in the strict sense of the term whose numbers hence
increase disproportionately. They enter it in a thoroughly discontented frame
of mind. Discontent breeds resentment. And it often rationalizes itself into
that social criticism which as we have seen before is in any case the
intellectual spectator’s typical attitude toward men, classes and institutions
especially in a rationalist and utilitarian civilization. Well, here we have
numbers; a well-defined group situation of proletarian hue; and a group
interest shaping a group attitude that will much more realistically account
for hostility to the capitalist order than could the theory—itself a
rationalization in the psychological sense—according to which the
intellectual’s righteous indignation about the wrongs of capitalism simply
represents the logical inference from outrageous facts and which is no better
than the theory of lovers that their feelings represent nothing but the logical
inference from the virtues of the beloved. 10 Moreover our theory also
accounts for the fact that this hostility increases, instead of diminishing, with
every achievement of capitalist evolution.
Of course, the hostility of the intellectual group—amounting to moral
disapproval of the capitalist order—is one thing, and the general hostile
atmosphere which surrounds the capitalist engine is another thing. The latter
is the really significant phenomenon; and it is not simply the product of the
former but flows partly from independent sources, some of which have been
mentioned before; so far as it does, it is raw material for the intellectual
group to work on. There are give-and-take relations between the two which
it would require more space to unravel than I can spare. The general contours
of such an analysis are however sufficiently obvious and I think it safe to
repeat that the role of the intellectual group consists primarily in stimulating,
energizing, verbalizing and organizing this material and only secondarily in
adding to it. Some particular aspects will illustrate the principle.
6. Capitalist evolution produces a labor movement which obviously is
not the creation of the intellectual group. But it is not surprising that such
an opportunity and the intellectual demiurge should find each other.
Labor never craved intellectual leadership but intellectuals invaded labor
politics. They had an important contribution to make: they verbalized the
10 The reader will observe that any such theories would be unrealistic even if the facts of
capitalism or the virtues of the beloved were actually all that the social critic or the lover
believes them to be. It is also important to note that in the overwhelming majority of cases
both critics and lovers are obviously sincere; neither psycho-sociological nor psycho-physical
mechanisms enter as a rule into the limelight of the Ego, except in the mask of sublimations.
Can Capitalism Survive?154
movement, supplied theories and slogans for it—class war is an excellent
example—made it conscious of itself and in doing so changed its
meaning. In solving this task from their own standpoint, they naturally
radicalized it, eventually imparting a revolutionary bias to the most
bourgeois trade-union practices, a bias most of the non-intellectual
leaders at first greatly resented. But there was another reason for this.
Listening to the intellectual, the workman is almost invariably conscious
of an impassable gulf if not of downright distrust. In order to get hold
of him and to compete with non-intellectual leaders, the intellectual is
driven to courses entirely unnecessary for the latter who can afford to
frown. Having no genuine authority and feeling always in danger of
being unceremoniously told to mind his own business, he must flatter,
promise and incite, nurse left wings and scowling minorities, sponsor
doubtful or submarginal cases, appeal to fringe ends, profess himself
ready to obey—in short, behave toward the masses as his predecessors
behaved first toward their ecclesiastical superiors, later toward princes
and other individual patrons, still later toward the collective master of
bourgeois complexion. 11 Thus, though intellectuals have not created the
labor movement, they have yet worked it up into something that differs
substantially from what it would be without them.
The social atmosphere, for the theory of which we have been gathering
stones and mortar, explains why public policy grows more and more hostile
to capitalist interests, eventually so much so as to refuse on principle to take
account of the requirements of the capitalist engine and to become a serious
impediment to its functioning. The intellectual group’s activities have
however a relation to anti-capitalist policies that is more direct than what is
implied in their share in verbalizing them. Intellectuals rarely enter
professional politics and still more rarely conquer responsible office. But
they staff political bureaus, write party pamphlets and speeches, act as
secretaries and advisers, make the individual politician’s newspaper
reputation which, though it is not everything, few men can afford to neglect.
In doing these things they to some extent impress their mentality on almost
everything that is being done.
The actual influence exerted varies greatly with the state of the political
game from mere formulation to making a measure politically possible or
impossible. But there is always plenty of scope for it. When we say that
individual politicians and parties are exponents of class interests we are at
best emphasizing one-half of the truth. The other half, just as important if
not more so, comes into view when we consider that politics is a profession
11 All this will be illustrated and further developed in Part V.
Growing Hostility 155
which evolves interests of its own—interests that may clash with as well
as conform to the interests of the groups that a man or party “represents.” 12
Individual and party opinion is, more than anything else, sensitive to those
factors in the political situation that directly affect the career or the
standing of the individual or party. Some of these are controlled by the
intellectual group in much the same sense as is the moral code of an epoch
that exalts the cause of some interests and puts the cause of others tacitly
out of court.
Finally, that social atmosphere or code of values affects not only
policies—the spirit of legislation—but also administrative practice. But again
there is also a more direct relation between the intellectual group and
bureaucracy. The bureaucracies of Europe are of pre- and extra-capitalist
origin. However much they may have changed in composition as the
centuries rolled on, they never identified themselves wholly with the
bourgeoisie, its interests or its scheme of values, and never saw much more
in it than an asset to be managed in the interest of the monarch or of the
nation. Except for inhibitions due to professional training and experience,
they are therefore open to conversion by the modern intellectual with whom,
through a similar education, they have much in common, 13 while the tinge
of gentility that in many cases used to raise a barrier has been fading away
from the modern civil servant during the last decades. Moreover, in times
of rapid expansion of the sphere of public administration, much of the
additional personnel required has to be taken directly from the intellectual
group—witness this country.
12 This of course is just as true of the intellectuals themselves with respect to the class from
which they come or to which, economically and culturally, they belong. The subject will be
taken up again in ch. xxiii.
13 For examples see ch. xxvi.

CHAPTER XIV
DECOMPOSITION
1. Faced by the increasing hostility of the environment and by the legislative,
administrative and judicial practice born of that hostility, entrepreneurs and
capitalists—in fact the whole stratum that accepts the bourgeois scheme of
life—will eventually cease to function. Their standard aims are rapidly
becoming unattainable, their efforts futile. The most glamorous of these
bourgeois aims, the foundation of an industrial dynasty, has in most countries
become unattainable already, and even more modest ones are so difficult to
attain that they may cease to be thought worth the struggle as the
permanence of these conditions is being increasingly realized.
Considering the role of bourgeois motivation in the explanation of the
economic history of the last two or three centuries, its smothering by the
unfavorable reactions of society or its weakening by disuse no doubt constitutes
a factor adequate to explain a flop in the capitalist process—should we ever
observe it as a permanent phenomenon—and one that is much more important
than any of those that are presented by the Theory of Vanishing Investment
Opportunity. It is hence interesting to observe that that motivation not only is
threatened by forces external to the bourgeois mind but that it also tends to die
out from internal causes. There is of course close interdependence between the
two. But we cannot get at the true diagnosis unless we try to disentangle them.
One of those “internal causes” we have already met with. I have dubbed it
Evaporation of the Substance of Property. We have seen that, normally, the
modern businessman, whether entrepreneur or mere managing administrator, is
of the executive type. From the logic of his position he acquires something of
the psychology of the salaried employee working in a bureaucratic organization.
Whether a stockholder or not, his will to fight and to hold on is not and cannot
be what it was with the man who knew ownership and its responsibilities in the
fullblooded sense of those words. His system of values and his conception of
duty undergo a profound change. Mere stockholders of course have ceased to
count at all—quite independently of the clipping of their share by a regulating
and taxing state. Thus the modern corporation, although the product of the
capitalist process, socializes the bourgeois mind; it relentlessly narrows the scope
of capitalist motivation; not only that, it will eventually kill its roots.1
1 Many people will deny this. This is due to the fact that they derive their impression
from past history and from the slogans generated by past history during which the
Decomposition 157
2. Still more important however is another “internal cause,” viz., the
disintegration of the bourgeois family. The facts to which I am referring are
too well known to need explicit statement. To men and women in modern
capitalist societies, family life and parenthood mean less than they meant
before and hence are less powerful molders of behavior; the rebellious son
or daughter who professes contempt for “Victorian” standards is, however
incorrectly, expressing an undeniable truth. The weight of these facts is not
impaired by our inability to measure them statistically. The marriage rate
proves nothing because the term Marriage covers as many sociological
meanings as does the term Property, and the kind of alliance that used to be
formed by the marriage contract may completely die out without any change
in the legal construction or in the frequency of the contract. Nor is the
divorce rate more significant. It does not matter how many marriages are
dissolved by judicial decree—what matters is how many lack the content
essential to the old pattern. If in our statistical age readers insist on a
statistical measure, the proportion of marriages that produce no children or
only one child, though still inadequate to quantify the phenomenon I mean,
might come as near as we can hope to come to indicating its numerical
importance. The phenomenon by now extends, more or less, to all classes.
But it first appeared in the bourgeois (and intellectual) stratum and its
symptomatic as well as causal value for our purposes lies entirely there. It
is wholly attributable to the rationalization of everything in life, which we
have seen is one of the effects of capitalist evolution. In fact, it is but one
of the results of the spread of that rationalization to the sphere of private life.
All the other factors which are usually adduced in explanation can be readily
reduced to that one.
As soon as men and women learn the utilitarian lesson and refuse to take
for granted the traditional arrangements that their social environment makes
for them, as soon as they acquire the habit of weighing the individual
advantages and disadvantages of any prospective course of action—or, as we
might also put it, as soon as they introduce into their private life a sort of
inarticulate system of cost accounting—they cannot fail to become aware of
the heavy personal sacrifices that family ties and especially parenthood entail
under modern conditions and of the fact that at the same time, excepting the
cases of farmers and peasants, children cease to be economic assets. These
sacrifices do not consist only of the items that come within the reach of the
institutional change brought about by the big corporation had not yet asserted itself. Also
they may think of the scope which corporate business used to give for illegal satisfactions
of the capitalist motivation. But that would cut my way: the fact that personal gain
beyond salary and bonus cannot, in corporate business, be reaped by executives except
by illegal or semi-illegal practices shows precisely that the structural idea of the
corporation is averse to it.
Can Capitalism Survive?158
measuring rod of money but comprise in addition an indefinite amount of loss
of comfort, of freedom from care, and opportunity to enjoy alternatives of
increasing attractiveness and variety—alternatives to be compared with joys
of parenthood that are being subjected to a critical analysis of increasing
severity. The implication of this is not weakened but strengthened by the fact
that the balance sheet is likely to be incomplete, perhaps even fundamentally
wrong. For the greatest of the assets, the contribution made by parenthood to
physical and moral health—to “normality” as we might express it—particularly
in the case of women, almost invariably escapes the rational searchlight of
modern individuals who, in private as in public life, tend to focus attention
on ascertainable details of immediate utilitarian relevance and to sneer at the
idea of hidden necessities of human nature or of the social organism. The point
I wish to convey is, I think, clear without further elaboration. It may be
summed up in the question that is so clearly in many potential parents’ minds:
“Why should we stunt our ambitions and impoverish our lives in order to be
insulted and looked down upon in our old age?”
While the capitalist process, by virtue of the psychic attitudes it creates,
progressively dims the values of family life and removes the conscientious
inhibitions that an old moral tradition would have put in the way toward a
different scheme of life, it at the same time implements the new tastes. As
regards childlessness, capitalist inventiveness produces contraceptive devices
of ever-increasing efficiency that overcome the resistance which the strongest
impulse of man would otherwise have put up. As regards the style of life,
capitalist evolution decreases the desirability of, and provides alternatives to,
the bourgeois family home. I have previously adverted to the Evaporation
of Industrial Property; I have now to advert to the Evaporation of
Consumers’ Property.
Until the later decades of the nineteenth century, the town house and the
country place were everywhere not only pleasant and convenient shells of
private life on the higher levels of income, but they were indispensable.
Not only hospitality on any scale and in any style, but even the comfort,
dignity, repose and refinement of the family depended upon its having an
adequate foyer of its own that was adequately staffed. The arrangements
summarized by the term Home were accordingly accepted as a matter of
course by the average man and woman of bourgeois standing, exactly as
they looked upon marriage and children—the “founding of a family”—as
a matter of course.
Now, on the one hand, the amenities of the bourgeois home are becoming
less obvious than are its burdens. To the critical eye of a critical age it is likely
to appear primarily as a source of trouble and expense which frequently fail
to justify themselves. This would be so even independently of modern taxation
Decomposition 159
and wages and of the attitude of modern household personnel, all of which
are typical results of the capitalist process and of course greatly strengthen the
case against what in the near future will be almost universally recognized as
an outmoded and uneconomical way of life. In this respect as in others we are
living in a transitional stage. The average family of bourgeois standing tends
to reduce the difficulties of running the big house and the big country place
by substituting for it small and mechanized establishments plus a maximum
of outside service and outside life—hospitality in particular being increasingly
shifted to the restaurant or club.
On the other hand, the home of the old type is no longer an indispensable
requirement of comfortable and refined living in the bourgeois sphere. The
apartment house and the apartment hotel represent a rationalized type of
abode and another style of life which when fully developed will no doubt
meet the new situation and provide all the essentials of comfort and
refinement. To be sure, neither that style nor its shell are fully developed
anywhere as yet and they proffer cost advantage only if we count in the
trouble and annoyance incident to running a modern home. But other
advantages they proffer already—the facility of using to the full the variety
of modern enjoyments, of travel, of ready mobility, of shifting the load of
the current little things of existence to the powerful shoulders of highly
specialized organizations.
It is easy to see how this in turn bears, in the upper strata of capitalist
society, upon the problems of the child. Again there is interaction: the
passing of the spacious home—in which alone the rich life of a numerous
family can unfold 2 —and the increasing friction with which it functions
supply another motive for avoiding the cares of parenthood; but the decline
of philoprogenitivity in turn renders the spacious home less worth while.
I have said that the new style of bourgeois life does not as yet offer any
decisive cost advantage. But this refers only to the current or prime costs of
servicing the wants of private life. As to overhead, even the purely pecuniary
advantage is obvious already. And inasmuch as the outlay on the most
durable elements of home life—especially the house, the pictures, the
furniture—used to be financed mainly from previous earnings we may say
that the need for accumulation of “consumers’ capital” is drastically reduced
by that process. This does not mean of course that demand for “consumers’
capital” is at present, even relatively, smaller than it was; the increasing
demand for durable consumers’ goods from small and medium incomes
more than counter-balances this effect. But it does mean that, so far as the
hedonistic component in the pattern of acquisitive motives is concerned, the
2 Modern relations between parents and children are of course partly conditioned by the
crumbling of that steady frame of family life.
Can Capitalism Survive?160
desirability of incomes beyond a certain level is reduced. In order to satisfy
himself of this, the reader need only visualize the situation in a thoroughly
practical spirit: the successful man or couple or the “society” man or couple
who can pay for the best available accommodation in hotel, ship and train,
and for the best available qualities of the objects of personal consumption
and use—which qualities are increasingly being turned out by the conveyor
of mass production 3
—will, things being what they are, as a rule have all they
want with any intensity for themselves. And it is easy to see that a budget
framed on those lines will be far below the requirements of a “seignioral”
style of life.
3. In order to realize what all this means for the efficiency of the capitalist
engine of production we need only recall that the family and the family home
used to be the mainspring of the typically bourgeois kind of profit motive.
Economists have not always given due weight to this fact. When we look more
closely at their idea of the self-interest of entrepreneurs and capitalists we cannot
fail to discover that the results it was supposed to produce are really not at all
what one would expect from the rational self-interest of the detached individual
or the childless couple who no longer look at the world through the windows
of a family home. Consciously or unconsciously they analyzed the behavior of
the man whose views and motives are shaped by such a home and who means
to work and to save primarily for wife and children. As soon as these fade out
from the moral vision of the businessman, we have a different kind of homo
oeconomicus before us who cares for different things and acts in different ways.
For him and from the standpoint of his individualistic utilitarianism, the behavior
of that old type would in fact be completely irrational. He loses the only sort of
romance and heroism that is left in the unromantic and unheroic civilization of
capitalism—the heroism of navigare necesse est, vivere non necesse est.4 And
he loses the capitalist ethics that enjoins working for the future irrespective of
whether or not one is going to harvest the crop oneself.
The last point may be put more tellingly. In the preceding chapter it was
observed that the capitalist order entrusts the long-run interests of society to
the upper strata of the bourgeoisie. They are really entrusted to the family
motive operative in those strata. The bourgeoisie worked primarily in order
to invest, and it was not so much a standard of consumption as a standard
of accumulation that the bourgeoisie struggled for and tried to defend against

governments that took the short-run view. 5 With the decline of the driving
power supplied by the family motive, the businessman’s time-horizon
shrinks, roughly, to his life expectation. And he might now be less willing
than he was to fulfill that function of earning, saving and investing even if
he saw no reason to fear that the results would but swell his tax bills. He
drifts into an anti-saving frame of mind and accepts with an increasing
readiness anti-saving theories that are indicative of a short-run philosophy.
But anti-saving theories are not all that he accepts. With a different
attitude to the concern he works for and with a different scheme of private
life he tends to acquire a different view of the values and standards of the
capitalist order of things. Perhaps the most striking feature of the picture is
the extent to which the bourgeoisie, besides educating its own enemies,
allows itself in turn to be educated by them. It absorbs the slogans of current
radicalism and seems quite willing to undergo a process of conversion to a
creed hostile to its very existence. Haltingly and grudgingly it concedes in
part the implications of that creed. This would be most astonishing and
indeed very hard to explain were it not for the fact that the typical bourgeois
is rapidly losing faith in his own creed. And this again becomes fully
understandable as soon as we realize that the social conditions which account
for its emergence are passing.
This is verified by the very characteristic manner in which particular
capitalist interests and the bourgeoisie as a whole behave when facing direct
attack. They talk and plead—or hire people to do it for them; they snatch at
every chance of compromise; they are ever ready to give in; they never put
up a fight under the flag of their own ideals and interests—in this country
there was no real resistance anywhere against the imposition of crushing
financial burdens during the last decade or against labor legislation
incompatible with the effective management of industry. Now, as the reader
will surely know by this time, I am far from overestimating the political
power of either big business or the bourgeoisie in general. Moreover, I am
prepared to make large allowances for cowardice. But still, means of defense
were not entirely lacking as yet and history is full of examples of the success
of small groups who, believing in their cause, were resolved to stand by their
guns. The only explanation for the meekness we observe is that the bourgeois
order no longer makes any sense to the bourgeoisie itself and that, when all
is said and nothing is done, it does not really care.
Thus the same economic process that undermines the position of the
bourgeoisie by decreasing the importance of the functions of entrepreneurs
5 It has been said that in economic matters “the state can take the longer view.” But
excepting certain matters outside of party politics such as conservation of natural resources, it
hardly ever does.
Can Capitalism Survive?162
and capitalists, by breaking up protective strata and institutions, by creating
an atmosphere of hostility, also decomposes the motor forces of capitalism
from within. Nothing else shows so well that the capitalist order not only
rests on props made of extra-capitalist material but also derives its energy
from extra-capitalist patterns of behavior which at the same time it is bound
to destroy.
We have rediscovered what from different standpoints and, so I believe,
on inadequate grounds has often been discovered before: there is inherent
in the capitalist system a tendency toward self-destruction which, in its
earlier stages, may well assert itself in the form of a tendency toward
retardation of progress.
I shall not stay to repeat how objective and subjective, economic and
extra-economic factors, reinforcing each other in imposing accord, contribute
to that result. Nor shall I stay to show what should be obvious and in
subsequent chapters will become more obvious still, viz., that those factors
make not only for the destruction of the capitalist but for the emergence of
a socialist civilization. They all point in that direction. The capitalist process
not only destroys its own institutional framework but it also creates the
conditions for another. Destruction may not be the right word after all.
Perhaps I should have spoken of transformation. The outcome of the process
is not simply a void that could be filled by whatever might happen to turn
up; things and souls are transformed in such a way as to become increasingly
amenable to the socialist form of life. With every peg from under the
capitalist structure vanishes an impossibility of the socialist plan. In both
these respects Marx’s vision was right. We can also agree with him in linking
the particular social transformation that goes on under our eyes with an
economic process as its prime mover. What our analysis, if correct, disproves
is after all of secondary importance, however essential the role may be which
it plays in the socialist credo. In the end there is not so much difference as
one might think between saying that the decay of capitalism is due to its
success and saying that it is due to its failure.
But our answer to the question that heads this part posits far more
problems than it solves. In view of what is to follow in this book, the reader
should bear in mind:
First, that so far we have not learned anything about the kind of socialism
that may be looming in the future. For Marx and for most of his followers—
and this was and is one of the most serious shortcomings of their doctrine—
socialism meant just one definite thing. But the definiteness really goes no
further than nationalization of industry would carry us and with this an
indefinite variety of economic and cultural possibilities will be seen to be
compatible.
Decomposition 163
Second, that similarly we know nothing as yet about the precise way by
which socialism may be expected to come except that there must be a great
many possibilities ranging from a gradual bureaucratization to the most
picturesque revolution. Strictly speaking we do not even know whether
socialism will actually come to stay. For to repeat: perceiving a tendency and
visualizing the goal of it is one thing and predicting that this goal will
actually be reached and that the resulting state of things will be workable,
let alone permanent, is quite another thing. Before humanity chokes (or
basks) in the dungeon (or paradise) of socialism it may well burn up in the
horrors (or glories) of imperialist wars. 6
Third, that the various components of the tendency we have been trying
to describe, while everywhere discernible, have as yet nowhere fully revealed
themselves. Things have gone to different lengths in different countries but
in no country far enough to allow us to say with any confidence precisely
how far they will go, or to assert that their “underlying trend” has grown too
strong to be subject to anything more serious than temporary reverses.
Industrial integration is far from being complete. Competition, actual and
potential, is still a major factor in any business situation. Enterprise is still
active, the leadership of the bourgeois group still the prime mover of the
economic process. The middle class is still a political power. Bourgeois
standards and bourgeois motivations though being increasingly impaired are
still alive. Survival of traditions—and family ownership of controlling parcels
of stock—still make many an executive behave as the owner-manager did
of old. The bourgeois family has not yet died; in fact, it clings to life so
tenaciously that no responsible politician has as yet dared to touch it by any
method other than taxation. From the standpoint of immediate practice as
well as for the purposes of shortrun forecasting—and in these things, a
century is a “short run” 7
—all this surface may be more important than the
tendency toward another civilization that slowly works deep down below.
6 Written in the summer of 1935.
7 This is why the facts and arguments presented in this and the two preceding chapters do
not invalidate my reasoning about the possible economic results of another fifty years of
capitalist evolution. The thirties may well turn out to have been the last gasp of capitalism—
the likelihood of this is of course greatly increased by the current war. But again they may not.
In any case there are no purely economic reasons why capitalism should not have another
successful run which is all I wished to establish.

PART III
Can Socialism Work?

167
CHAPTER XV
CLEARING DECKS
C AN socialism work? Of course it can. No doubt is possible about that
once we assume, first, that the requisite stage of industrial development
has been reached and, second, that transitional problems can be successfully
resolved. One may, of course, feel very uneasy about these assumptions
themselves or about the questions whether the socialist form of society can
be expected to be democratic and, democratic or not, how well it is likely
to function. All that will be discussed later on. But if we accept these
assumptions and discard these doubts the answer to the remaining question
is clearly Yes.
Before I attempt to prove it, I should like to clear some obstacles from our
way. We have so far been rather careless about certain definitions and we must
make up for it now. We shall simply envisage two types of society and mention
others only incidentally. These types we will call Commercial and Socialist.
Commercial society is defined by an institutional pattern of which we
need only mention two elements: private property in means of production
and regulation of the productive process by private contract (or management
or initiative). Such a type of society is not as a rule purely bourgeois,
however. For as we have seen in Part II an industrial and commercial
bourgeoisie will in general not be able to exist except in symbiosis with a
non-bourgeois stratum. Nor is commercial society identical with capitalist
society. The latter, a special case of the former, is defined by the additional
phenomenon of credit creation—by the practice, responsible for so many
outstanding features of modern economic life, of financing enterprise by
bank credit, i.e., by money (notes or deposits) manufactured for that purpose.
But since commercial society, as an alternative to socialism, in practice
always appears in the particular form of capitalism, it will make no great
difference if the reader prefers to keep to the traditional contrast between
capitalism and socialism.
By socialist society we shall designate an institutional pattern in which
the control over means of production and over production itself is vested
with a central authority—or, as we may say, in which, as a matter of
principle, the economic affairs of society belong to the public and not to the
private sphere. Socialism has been called an intellectual Proteus. There are
many ways of defining it—many acceptable ways, that is, besides the silly
Can Socialism Survive?168
ones such as that socialism means bread for all—and ours is not necessarily
the best. But there are some points about it which it may be well for us to
notice, braving the danger of an indictment on the score of pedantry.
Our definition excludes guild socialism, syndicalism and other types. This
is because what may be termed Centralist Socialism seems to me to hold the
field so clearly that it would be waste of space to consider other forms. But
if we adopt this term in order to indicate the only kind of socialism we shall
consider, we must be careful to avoid a misunderstanding. The term centralist
socialism is only intended to exclude the existence of a plurality of units of
control such that each of them would on principle stand for a distinct interest
of its own, in particular the existence of a plurality of autonomous territorial
sectors that would go far toward reproducing the antagonisms of capitalist
society. This exclusion of sectional interests may well be thought unrealistic.
Nonetheless it is essential.
But our term is not intended to suggest centralism either in the sense that
the central authority, which we shall alternatively call Central Board or
Ministry of Production, is necessarily absolute or in the sense that all the
initiative that pertains to the executive proceeds from it alone. As regards the
first point, the board or ministry may have to submit its plan to a congress or
parliament. There may also be a supervising and checking authority—a kind
of cour des comptes that could conceivably even have the right to veto
particular decisions. As regards the second point, some freedom of action must
be left, and almost any amount of freedom might be left, to the “men on the
spot,” say, the managers of the individual industries or plants. For the moment,
I will make the bold assumption that the rational amount of freedom is
experimentally found and actually granted so that efficiency suffers neither
from the unbridled ambitions of subordinates nor from the piling up on the
desk of the minister of reports and unanswered questions—nor from orders
of the latter suggestive of Mark Twain’s rules about the harvesting of potatoes.
I have not separately defined collectivism or communism. The former
term I shall not use at all and the latter only incidentally with reference to
groups that call themselves so. But if I had to use them I should make them
synonymous with socialism. Analyzing historical usage, most writers have
tried to give them distinct meanings. It is true that the term communist has
fairly consistently been chosen to denote ideas more thoroughgoing or
radical than others. But then, one of the classic documents of socialism is
entitled the “Communist” Manifesto. And the difference of principle has
never been fundamental—what there is of it is no less pronounced within
the socialist camp than it is as between it and the communist one. Bolsheviks
call themselves communists and at the same time the true and only socialist.’
Whether or not the true and only ones, they are certainly socialists
Clearing Decks 169
I have avoided the terms state ownership of, or property in, natural
resources, plant and equipment. This point is of some importance in the
methodology of the social sciences. There are no doubt concepts that bear no
relation to any particular epoch or social world, such as want or choice or
economic good. There are others which, while in their everyday meaning they
do bear such a relation, have been refined by the analyst to the point of losing
it. Price or cost may serve as examples.1 But there are still others which by
virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor
of a particular institutional framework. It is extremely dangerous, in fact it
amounts to a distortion of historical description, to use them beyond the social
world or culture whose denizens they are. Now ownership or property—also,
so I believe, taxation—are such denizens of the world of commercial society,
exactly as knights and fiefs are denizens of the feudal world.
But so is the state. We might of course define it by the criterion of
sovereignty and then speak of a socialist state. But if there is to be meat in
the concept and not merely legal or philosophic gas, the state should not be
allowed to intrude into discussions of either feudal or socialist society, neither
of which did or would display that dividing line between the private and the
public sphere from which the better part of its meaning flows. To conserve that
meaning with all its wealth of functions, methods and attitudes, it seems best
to say that the state, the product of the clashes and compromises between
feudal lords and bourgeoisie, will form part of the ashes from which the
socialist phoenix is to rise. Therefore, I did not use it in my definition of
socialism. Of course socialism may come about by an act of the state. But there
is no inconvenience that I can see in saying that the state dies in this act—as
has been pointed out by Marx and repeated by Lenin.
In one respect, finally, our definition agrees with all the others that I
have ever come across, viz., in that it turns on an exclusively economic
point. Every socialist wishes to revolutionize society from the economic
angle and all the blessings he expects are to come through a change in
economic institutions. This of course implies a theory about social
causation—the theory that the economic pattern is the really operative
element in the sum total of the phenomena that we call society. Two
remarks, however, suggest themselves.
First, it has been pointed out in the preceding part with reference to
capitalism, and must now be pointed out with reference to socialism, that
neither for us, the observers, nor for the people that are to put their trust in
socialism, is the economic aspect the only or even the most important one.
1 Price, in modern theory, is defined as a mere coefficient of transformation. Cost, in
the sense of opportunity cost, is a general logical category. We shall however soon return
to this.
Can Socialism Survive?170
In defining as I did, I did not intend to deny that. And in fairness to all the
civilized socialists whom I have ever met or read, it should be stated that
the same holds true for them: that in stressing the economic element because
of the causative importance their creed attributes to it, they do not mean to
suggest that nothing is worth struggling for except beefsteaks and radios.
There are indeed insufferable stick-in-the-muds who mean precisely that And
many who are not stick-in-the-muds will nevertheless, in the hunt for votes,
emphasize the economic promise because of its immediate appeal. In doing
so they distort and degrade their creed. We will not do the same. Instead we
will keep in mind that socialism aims at higher goals than full bellies, exactly
as Christianity means more than the somewhat hedonistic values of heaven
and hell. First and foremost, socialism means a new cultural world. For the
sake of it, one might conceivably be a fervent socialist even though believing
that the socialist arrangement is likely to be inferior as to economic
performance. 2 Hence no merely economic argument for or against can ever
be decisive, however successful in itself.
But second—what cultural world? We might try to answer this question
by surveying the actual professions of accredited socialists in order to see
whether a type emerges from them. At first sight, the material seems to be
abundant. Some socialists are ready enough, with folded hands and the smile
of the blessed on their lips, to chant the canticle of justice, equality, freedom
in general and freedom from “the exploitation of man by man” in particular,
of peace and love, of fetters broken and cultural energies unchained, of new
horizons opened, of new dignities revealed. But that is Rousseau adulterated
with some Bentham. Others simply voice the interests and appetites of the
radical wing of trade unionism. Still others, however, are remarkably reticent.
Because they despise cheap slogans but cannot think of anything else?
Because, though they do think of something else, they doubt its popular
appeal? Because they know that they differ hopelessly with their comrades?
So we cannot proceed on this line. Instead we have to face what I shall
refer to as the Cultural Indeterminateness of Socialism. In fact, according to
our definition as well as to most others, a society may be fully and truly
socialist and yet be led by an absolute ruler or be organized in the most
democratic of all possible ways; it may be aristocratic or proletarian; it may
be a theocracy and hierarchic or atheist or indifferent as to religion; it may
be much more strictly disciplined than men are in a modern army or
completely lacking in discipline; it may be ascetic or eudemonist in spirit;
energetic or slack; thinking only of the future or only of the day; warlike
and nationalist or peaceful and internationalist; equalitarian or the opposite;
2 The reverse is also true of course: one might concede the economic claims made on behalf
of socialism and yet hate it on cultural grounds.
Clearing Decks 171
it may have the ethics of lords or the ethics of slaves; its art may be
subjective or objective; 3 its forms of life individualistic or standardized;
and—what for some of us would by itself suffice to command our allegiance
or to arouse our contempt—it may breed from its supernormal or from its
subnormal stock and produce supermen or submen accordingly.
Why is this so? Well, the reader may have his choice. He may say either
that Marx is wrong and that the economic pattern does not determine a
civilization or else that the complete economic pattern would determine it
but that, without the aid of further economic data and assumptions, the
element that constitutes socialism in our sense does not. We should not
have fared any better with capitalism, by the way, had we tried to
reconstruct its cultural world from nothing but the facts embodied in our
definition of it. We have in this case no doubt an impression of
determinateness and find it possible to reason on tendencies in capitalist
civilization. But this is only because we have a historic reality before us
that supplies us with all the additional data we need and via facti excludes
an infinite number of possibilities.
We have, however, used the word determinateness in a rather strict and
technical sense and, moreover, with reference to a whole cultural world.
Indeterminateness in this sense is no absolute bar to attempts at
discovering certain features or tendencies that the socialist arrangement
as such may be more likely to produce than others, especially features
of, and tendencies in, particular spots of the cultural organism. Nor is it
impossible to frame reasonable additional assumptions. This much is
obvious from the above survey of possibilities. If, for instance, we
believe as many socialists do—wrongly, as I think—that wars are nothing
but one of the forms of the conflict of capitalist interests, it readily
follows that socialism would be pacifist and not warlike. Or if we assume
that socialism evolves along with, and is inseparable from, a certain type
of rationalism we shall conclude that it is likely to be irreligious if not
anti-religious. We shall ourselves try our hand at this game here and
there, although in the main we had better yield the floor to the only truly
great performer in that field, Plato. But all this does not do away with
the fact that socialism is indeed a cultural Proteus and that its cultural
possibilities can be made more definite only if we resign ourselves to
speaking of special cases within the socialist genus—each of which to
be sure will be the only true one for the man who stands for it but any
one of which may be in store for us.
3 Paradoxical as it sounds, individualism and socialism are not necessarily opposites. One
may argue that the socialist form of organization will guarantee “truly” individualistic
realization of personality. This would in fact be quite in the Marxian line.

CHAPTER XVI
THE SOCIALIST BLUEPRINT
F IRST of all we must see whether or not there is anything wrong with
the pure logic of a socialist economy. For although no proof of the
soundness of that logic will ever convert anyone to socialism or, in fact,
prove much for socialism as a practical proposition, proof of logical
unsoundness or even failure in an attempt to prove logical soundness would
in itself suffice to convict it of inherent absurdity.
More precisely, our question may be formulated as follows: given a
socialist system of the kind envisaged, is it possible to derive, from its data
and from the rules of rational behavior, uniquely determined decisions as to
what and how to produce or, to put the same thing into the slogan of exact
economics, do those data and rules, under the circumstances of a socialist
economy, yield equations which are independent, compatible—i.e., free from
contradiction—and sufficient in number to determine uniquely the unknowns
of the problem before the central board or ministry of production?
1. The answer is in the affirmative. There is nothing wrong with the pure
logic of socialism. And this is so obvious that it would not have occurred to
me to insist on it were it not for the fact that it has been denied and the still
more curious fact that orthodox socialists, until they were taught their
business by economists of strongly bourgeois views and sympathies, failed
to produce an answer that would meet scientific requirements.
The only authority standing for denial that we need to mention is
Professor L.von Mises. 1 Starting from the proposition that rational economic
behavior presupposes rational cost calculations, hence prices of cost factors,
hence markets which price them, he concluded that in a socialist society,
since there would be no such markets, the beacon lights of rational
production would be absent so that the system would have to function in a
haphazard manner if at all. To this and similar criticisms or perhaps to some
doubts of their own, the accredited exponents of socialist orthodoxy had at
first not much to oppose except the argument that the socialist management
would be able to start from the system of values evolved by its capitalist
predecessor—which is no doubt relevant for a discussion of practical
1 His paper, published in 1920. is now available in English; see Collectivist Economic
Planning (F.A.von Hayek. ed., 1935). Also see his Gemeinwirtschaft, English translation under
the title Socialism (1937).
The Socialist Blueprint 173
difficulties but not at all for the question of principle—or a paean on the
miraculous glories of their heaven, in which it would be easy to dispense
altogether with capitalist tricks like cost rationality and in which comrades
would solve all problems by helping themselves to the bounties pouring forth
from social stores. This amounts to accepting the criticism, and some
socialists actually seem to do so even today.
The economist who settled the question in a manner that left little to do
except elaboration and the clearing up of points of secondary importance,
was Enrico Barone to whose argument I refer readers who want a rigorous
demonstration. 2 Here a brief sketch will suffice.
Viewed from the economists’ standpoint, production—including
transportation and all operations incident to marketing—is nothing but the
rational combination of the existing “factors” within the constraints imposed
by technological conditions. In a commercial society, the task of combining
factors involves buying or hiring them, and those individual incomes which
are typical of such a society emerge in this very process of buying or hiring.
That is to say, the production and the “distribution” of the social product are
but different aspects of one and the same process that affects both
simultaneously. Now the most important logical—or purely theoretical—
difference between commercial and socialist economy is that in the latter this
is no longer so. Since prima facie there are no market values of means of
production and, what is still more important, since the principles of socialist
society would not admit of making them the criterion of distribution even if
they did exist, the distributive automatism of commercial society is lacking
in a socialist one. The void has to be filled by a political act, let us say by
the constitution of the commonwealth. Distribution thus becomes a distinct
operation and, in logic at least, is completely severed from production. This
political act or decision would have to result from, and in turn go a long way
2 Upward of a dozen economists had hinted at the solution before Barone. Among them were
such authorities as F.von Wieser (in his Natural Value, 1893, German original 1889) and Pareto
(Cours d’Économie politique, vol. ii, 1897). Both perceived the fact that the fundamental logic
of economic behavior is the same in both commercial and socialist society from which the
solution follows. But Barone, a follower of Pareto, was the first to work it out. See his papers
entitled “Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista,” Giornale degli Economisti,
1908; English translation included in the volume Collectivist Economic Planning mentioned
in the preceding note.
It is neither possible nor necessary to do justice to the rich crop of later work. I will only
mention, as particularly important in one way or another: Fred M.Taylor, “The Guidance of
Production in a Socialist State,” American Economic Review, March 1929; K.Tisch,
Wirtschaftsrechnung und Verteilung im… sozialistischen Gemeinwesen, 1932; H.Zassenhaus,
“Theorie der Planwirtschaft,” Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie, 1934; especially Oskar Lange,
“On the Economic Theory of Socialism,” Review of Economic Studies, 1936/7, republished as
a book in Lange and Taylor, same title, 1938; and A.P.Lerner whose articles will be referred
to in a later footnote.
Can Socialism Survive?174
toward determining, the economic and cultural character of the society, its
behavior, aims and achievements; but it would be completely arbitrary when
viewed from the economic standpoint. As has been pointed out before, the
commonwealth may adopt an equalitarian rule—and this again in any of the
many meanings that may be associated with equalitarian ideals—or admit
inequalities to any desired degree. It might even distribute with a view to
producing maximum performance in any desired direction—a particularly
interesting case. It may study the wishes of individual comrades or resolve
to give them what some authority or other thinks best for them; the slogan
“to everyone according to his needs” might carry either meaning. But some
rule must be established. For our purpose it will be sufficient to consider a
very special case.
2. Suppose then that the ethical persuasion of our socialist commonwealth
is thoroughly equalitarian but at the same time prescribes that comrades
should be free to choose as they please among all the consumers’ goods
which the ministry is able and willing to produce—the community may of
course refuse to produce certain commodities, alcoholic beverages for
instance. Furthermore let us assume that the particular equalitarian ideal
adopted is satisfied by handing out to every person—children and possibly
other individuals counting for fractional persons as the competent authority
may decide—a voucher representing his or her claim to a quantity of
consumers’ goods equal to the social product available in the current period
of account divided by the number of claimants, all vouchers to become
valueless at the end of that period. These vouchers can be visualized as
claims to the Xth part of all food, clothing, household goods, houses,
motorcars, movie plays and so on that have been or are being produced for
consumption (for the purpose of being delivered to consumers) during the
period under consideration. It is only to avoid a complex and unnecessary
mass of exchanges that would otherwise have to take place among the
comrades, that we express the claims not in goods but by equal amounts of
conveniently chosen but meaningless units—we can call them simply units,
or moons or suns or even dollars—and rule that units of each good will be
handed over against the surrender of a stated number of them. These “prices”
charged by the social stores would under our assumptions have always to
fulfill the condition that, each of them multiplied by the existing quantity of
the commodity to which it refers, they add up to the otherwise arbitrary total
of the comrades’ claims. But the ministry need not fix the individual “prices”
except by way of initial suggestions. Given the tastes and the equal “dollar
incomes,” comrades will reveal, by their reaction to these initial suggestions,
at what prices they are ready to take the whole social product save those
articles that nobody cares to have at all, and the ministry will then have to
The Socialist Blueprint 175
accept those prices if it wishes to have the stores cleared. This will
accordingly be done and the principle of equal shares will be thus carried
out in a very plausible sense and in a uniquely determined way.
But of course this presupposes that a definite quantity of every good has
already been produced. The real problem, the solvability of which has been
denied, is precisely how this can be done rationally, i.e., in a way which will
result in a maximum of consumers’ satisfaction 3 subject to the limits imposed
by the available resources, the technological possibilities and the rest of the
environmental conditions. It is clear that decision on the plan of production
by, say, a majority vote of the comrades would entirely fail to fulfill this 4
requirement because in this case certainly some people and possibly all the
people would not get what they want and what it would still be possible to
give them without reducing the satisfaction of others. It is, however, equally
clear that economic rationality in this sense can be attained in another way.
For the theorist this follows from the elementary proposition that consumers
in evaluating (“demanding”) consumers’ goods ipso facto also evaluate the
means of production which enter into the production of those goods. For the
layman proof of the possibility of a rational plan of production in our
socialist society can be supplied as follows.
3. To facilitate matters we will assume that means of production are
present in given and, for the moment, unalterable quantities. Now let the
central board resolve itself into a committee on a particular industry or,
still better, let us set up an authority for each industry that is to manage
it and to cooperate with the central board which controls and coordinates
all these industrial managers or managing boards. This the central board
does by allocating productive resources—all of which are under its
control—to these industrial managements according to certain rules.
Suppose the board rules that industrial managements can have any
quantities of producers’ goods and services they choose to call for subject
to three conditions. First, they must produce as economically as possible.
Second, they are required to transfer to the central board, for every unit
of each producer’s good and service called for, a stated number of those
consumers’ dollars which they have acquired by previous deliveries of
consumers’ goods—we might just as well say that the central board
declares itself ready to “sell” to any industrial management unlimited
quantities of producers’ goods and services at stated “prices.” Third, the
3 If modern theorists should object to this turn of phrase, let me entreat them to consider
the amount of entirely unnecessary circumlocution that more correct phrasing would involve
without offering, for the purposes of this argument, any compensatory advantage.
4 This is not to say that it would not fulfill requirements from the standpoint of another
definition of rationality. No assertion is being made here about how the arrangement under
discussion compares with others. Something will be said about this presently.
Can Socialism Survive?176
managements are required to call for and to use such quantities as (and
not less than), producing in the most economical manner, they can use
without having to “sell” any part of their products for less “dollars” than
they have to transfer to the central board for the corresponding amounts
of means of production. In more technical language, this condition means
that production in all lines should be such as to make “prices” equal (not
merely proportional) to marginal costs. 5
5 This principle, which follows from the general logic of choice, was not universally
accepted until Mr. A.P.Lerner stressed it and fought for it in a number of notes and papers,
mostly in the Review of Economic Studies (also in the Economic Journal, September 1937),
which constitute an important contribution to the theory of the socialist economy and to
which I take this opportunity of drawing the reader’s attention. It is also correct, as a
proposition of that logic of choice, to say that the above condition should prevail over the
rule of equating prices to total cost per unit whenever it conflicts with it. But the relation
between them has been somewhat obscured by a confusion of different things, and calls
for some clarification.
The concept of marginal cost, meaning the increment of total cost that must be incurred
if production is to be increased by a small amount, is indeterminate as long as we do not
relate it to a definite period of time. Thus, if the question is whether or not to transport an
additional passenger by a train that would run in any case, marginal cost to be considered
might be zero and at all events is very small. This may be expressed by saying that, from
the standpoint of a very short period—an hour or a day, or even a week—practically
everything is overhead, even lubricants and coal, and that overhead does not enter into
marginal cost. But the longer the period envisaged the more cost elements enter marginal
cost, first all that are usually comprised in the concept of prime cost and after them more
and more of what the businessman calls overhead, until, for the very long run or from the
standpoint of planning an as yet non-existent industrial unit, nothing (or practically nothing)
is left in the category of overhead and everything including depreciation has to be taken
into account in figuring out marginal cost, so far as this principle is not modified, in the
case of some factors such as a railroad track, by the technological fact that they are
available or usable only in very big units (“indivisibility”). Marginal costs should hence
always be distinguished from (marginal) prime costs.
Now we often associate the condition under discussion with the rule that the socialist—
just like the capitalist—managements should, at any point of time, let bygones be bygones
if they are to act rationally; that is to say that in their decisions they are not to take account
of the book values of existing investments. But this is only a rule for short-run behavior
in a given situation. It does not mean that they are to neglect ex ante those elements that
will crystallize into fixed costs or overhead. To neglect these would spell irrational behavior
with respect to the labor hours and units of natural resources that go into the production
of the overhead, whenever there is an alternative use for them. But to take account of them
will in general imply equating prices to total cost per unit of product as long as things
develop according to plans, and since exceptions are mainly due to the technological
obstacle to rationality represented by indivisibility or to deviations of the actual course of
events from the plans, the logic of these plans is after all not badly expressed by the latter
principle. Though in a short-run situation it may be the most rational thing to do, it is yet
never part of that logic to operate an industry at a deficit. This is important to note for
two reasons.
First, it has been denied. It has even been suggested that welfare would (i.e., in the
long run) be increased if prices were always equated to short-run marginal costs
excluding depreciation and that overhead (say, the cost of a bridge) should be financed
The Socialist Blueprint 177
The task of each industrial board is then uniquely determined. Exactly
as today every firm in a perfectly competitive industry knows what and
how much to produce and how to produce it as soon as technical
possibilities, reactions of consumers (their tastes and incomes) and prices
of means of production are given, so the industrial managements in our
socialist commonwealth would know what to produce, how to produce and
what factor quantities to “buy” from the central board as soon as the
latter’s “prices” are published and as soon as the consumers have revealed
their “demands.”
In a sense these “prices,” unlike the “prices” of consumers’ goods, are
unilaterally set by the central board. We may also say however that industrial
managers display a uniquely determined “demand” for the producers’ goods
much as consumers do for consumers’ goods. All we still need to complete
our proof is a rule, conforming to the maximum criterion, for that price-
fixing activity of the central board. But this rule is obvious. The board has
simply to set a single price on every kind and quality of producers’ goods—
if the board dis criminates, i.e., charges different prices for the same kind
and quality to different managements, this would in general 6 have to be
justified on non-economic grounds—and to see to it that that price exactly
“clears the market,” i.e., that no unused quantities of producers’ goods
remain on its hands and that no additional quantities are called at those
“prices.” This rule will normally suffice to insure rational cost accounting,
hence economically rational allocation of productive resources—for the
former is nothing but a method of insuring and verifying the latter—hence
rationality of the plan of production in socialist societies. Proof follows from
the consideration that as long as this rule is being observed no element of
productive resources can be diverted to any other line of production without
causing the destruction of as much (or more) consumers’ values, expressed
by taxation. Our rule, as given in the text, does not mean this, and it would not be a
rational thing to do.
Second, in a decree of March 1936 the Russian central authority, abolishing for a
number of industries the system of subsidies till then in force, prescribed that prices
should be regulated so as to equate average total cost per unit plus an addition for
accumulation. For the first part of the rule it may be said that, though not strictly correct,
it differs less from the correct one than incorrect formulations of the latter might lead
one to suppose; for the latter, that the obvious objection to it is much weakened as soon
as we take into account the conditions or necessities of rapid development—the reader
will recall the argument submitted in Part II for the capitalist case—and that it is quite
conceivable that the Soviet government was right both in embarking upon its policy of
subsidies, which amounted to financing investment at a loss, and in partly abolishing the
practice in 1936.
6 There are exceptions to this which are of importance but do not affect the drift
of our argument.
Can Socialism Survive?178
in terms of consumers’ dollars, as that element would add in its new
employment. This amounts to saying that production is being carried, in all
directions open in the general conditions of the society’s environment, as far
as and no farther than it rationally can be and completes our case for the
rationality of socialist planning in a stationary process of economic life in
which everything is correctly foreseen and repeats itself and in which nothing
happens to upset the plan.
4. But no great difficulties arise if we go beyond the precincts of the
theory of the stationary process and admit the phenomena incident to
industrial change. So far as economic logic is concerned, it cannot be held
that socialism of the kind envisaged, while theoretically capable of coping
with the recurrent tasks of the administration of a stationary economy, would
necessarily fail in the solution of the problems presented by “progress.” We
shall see later why it is nevertheless important for the success of a socialist
society that it should embark upon its career not only as richly endowed as
possible by its capitalist predecessor—with experience and techniques as
well as with resources—but also after the latter has sown its wild oats, done
its work and is approaching a stationary state. But the reason for it is not in
any inability of ours to devise a rational and uniquely determined course for
the socialist society to take whenever the opportunity for an improvement
in the industrial apparatus presents itself.
Suppose that a new and more efficient piece of machinery has been designed
for the productive process of industry X. In order to exclude the problems
incident to the financing of investment—to be considered presently—and to
isolate a distinct set of phenomena, we will assume that the new machine can
be produced by the same plants which thus far produced the less efficient one
and at exactly the same costs in terms of productive resources. The management
of industry X, in obedience to the first clause of its instruction—viz., the rule
to produce as economically as possible—will adopt the new machine and thus
produce the same output with a smaller amount of means of production than
heretofore. Consequently it would henceforth be in a position to transfer to the
ministry or central board an amount of consumers’ dollars smaller than the
amount received from consumers. Call the difference as you please, for instance
D, or a shovel, or “profits.” The management would, it is true, violate the
condition set by the third clause of its instruction if it realized that “profit”; and
if it obeys that clause and immediately produces the greater amount now required
in order to satisfy that condition, those profits will never emerge. But their
potential existence in the calculations of the management is quite sufficient to
make them fill the only function they would have under our assumption, viz.,
the function of indicating, in a uniquely determined manner, the direction and
extent of the reallocation of resources that it is now rational to carry out.
The Socialist Blueprint 179
If, at a time when the available resources of the society are fully employed
in the task of providing a given level of consumption, an improvement—such
as a new bridge or a new railway—which requires the use of additional
factors or, as we may also say, additional investment suggests itself, the
comrades would either have to work beyond the hours which so far we have
assumed to be fixed by law or to restrict their consumption or both. In this
case our assumptions, framed for the purpose of solving the fundamental
problem in the simplest possible way, preclude an “automatic” solution, i.e.,
a decision at which the central board and the industrial managements could
arrive merely by passively following, within the three rules, the guidance of
objective indications. But this of course is a disability of our schema and not
of the socialist economy. All we have to do if we wish to have such an
automatic solution is to repeal the law invalidating all claims to consumers’
goods that are not used during the period for which they are issued, to
renounce the principle of absolute equality of incomes and to grant power
to the central board to offer premiums for overtime and—what shall we call
it?—well, let us say saving. The condition that possible improvements or
investments be undertaken to such an extent that the least tempting one of
them would yield a “profit” equal to the premiums which have to be offered
in order to call forth the amounts of overtime or saving (or both) required
for it, then uniquely determines all the new variables that our problem
introduces provided overtime and saving are in the relevant interval single-
valued functions of the respective premiums. 7 The “dollars” that are handed
out in discharge of the latter may conveniently be assumed to be additional
to the income dollars issued before. The readjustments this would impose
in various directions need not detain us.
But this argument about investment makes it still clearer that the schema
which seemed best adapted to our particular purpose is neither the only
possible blueprint of a socialist economy, nor necessarily the. one that would
recommend itself to a socialist society. Socialism need not be equalitarian
but no amount of inequality of incomes that we could reasonably expect a
socialist society to tolerate is likely to produce the rate of investment that
capitalist society produces in the average of cyclical phases. Even capitalist
inequalities are not sufficient for that and they have to be reinforced by
corporate accumulation and “created” bank credit, methods which are not
particularly automatic or uniquely determined either. If, therefore, a socialist
7 The problem, it should be observed, only arises with new investment. Such investment as
is currently needed in order to keep a stationary process going can and would be provided for
exactly as are all other cost items. In particular, there would be no interest. I may take the
opportunity to observe that the attitude of socialists toward the phenomenon of interest is not
uniform. St. Simon admitted it almost as a matter of course. Marx excluded it from socialist
society. Some modern socialists again admit it. Russian practice admits it.
Can Socialism Survive?180
society desires to achieve a similar or even greater rate of real investment—
of course it need not—methods other than saving would have to be resorted
to. Accumulation out of “profits” which could be allowed to materialize
instead of remaining potential only or, as suggested above, something
analogous to credit creation would be quite feasible. It would be much
more natural however to leave the matter to the central board and the
congress or parliament who between them could settle it as part of the
social budget; while the vote on the “automatic” part of the society’s
economic operations would be purely formal or perhaps supervisory in
character, the vote on the investment item—at least on its amount—would
involve a real decision and stand on a par with the vote on army estimates
and so on. Coordination of this decision with the “automatic” decisions
about the quantities and qualities of individual consumers’ goods would
not present any insurmountable difficulties. But in accepting this solution
we should renounce allegiance to the basic principle of our schema in a
very important point.
Other features of our blueprint can be altered even within its general
framework. For example, with a conditional exception as to overtime, I
have not left it to the individual comrades to decide how much work they
are going to do, though as voters and in other ways they may have as
much influence on this decision as they have on the distribution of
incomes and so on. Nor have I allowed them more freedom of choice of
occupation than the central board, within the requirements of its general
plan, may be able and willing to grant them. The arrangement may be
visualized by means of the analogy with compulsory military service.
Such a plan comes fairly close to the slogan: “to everyone according to
his need, everyone to contribute according to his aptitude”—or at all
events it could, with only minor modifications, be made to conform to
it. But instead we may also leave it to the individual comrades to decide
how much and what kind of work they are to do. Rational allocation of
the working force would then have to be attempted by a system of
inducements—premiums again being offered, in this case not only for
overtime but for all work, so as to secure everywhere the “offer” of labor
of all types and grades appropriate to the structure of consumers’ demand
and to the investment program. These premiums would have to bear an
obvious relation to the attractiveness or irksomeness of each job and to
the skill that must be acquired in order to fill it, hence also to the wage
schedule of capitalist society. Though the analogy between the latter and
such a socialist system of premiums should not be pushed too far, we
might speak of a “labor market.” Insertion of this piece of mechanism
would of course make a great deal of difference to our blueprint. But it
The Socialist Blueprint 181
would not affect the determinateness of the socialist system. Its formal
rationality would in fact stand out still more strongly.
5. So would that family likeness between commercial and socialist
economy which the reader cannot have failed to notice all along. Since this
resemblance seems to have given pleasure to non-socialists and some
socialists and to have annoyed other socialists, it is just as well to restate
explicitly in what it consists and to what it is due. It will then be seen how
little reason there is for either the pleasure or the annoyance. In trying to
construct a rational schema of a socialist economy we have made use of
mechanisms and concepts traditionally specified by terms that are familiar
to us from our discussions of the processes and problems of capitalist
economy. We have described a mechanism which is immediately understood
as soon as we utter the words “market,” “buying and selling,” “competing”
and so on. We seem to have used, or barely avoided using, such terms
savoring of capitalism as prices, costs, incomes and even profits while rent,
interest, wages and others, money among them, have, as it were, hovered
about our path.
Let us consider what to most socialists would certainly seem to be one
of the worst cases, that of rent, meaning thereby returns from the productive
use of natural agents, let us say “land.” Our schema evidently cannot imply
that ground rent would be paid to any landholders. What then does it imply?
Simply that any kind of land which is not plentiful beyond all requirements
in the calculable future must be used economically or allocated rationally
exactly like labor or any other type of productive resources, and that for this
purpose it must receive an index of economic significance with which any
new use that may suggest itself must be compared and by means of which
the land enters the social bookkeeping process. If this were not done the
commonwealth would be behaving irrationally. But no concession to
capitalism or to the spirit of capitalism is implied in doing it. All that is
commercial or capitalist about ground rent, in both its economic and its
sociological associations, and all that can possibly be sympathetic to the
advocate of private property (private income, the landlord and so on) has
been completely removed.
The “incomes” with which we endowed the comrades at the start are not
wages. In fact they would on analysis be seen to be composites of disparate
economic elements of which one only could be linked to marginal
productivity of labor. The premiums which we introduced later have more
to do with the wages of capitalist society. But the counterpart of the latter
really exists nowhere except in the books of the central board and again
consists in a mere index of significance associated, for the purposes of
rational allocation, with every type and grade of labor—an index from which
Can Socialism Survive?182
has vanished a whole bundle of meanings that pertain to the capitalist world.
In passing, we may observe that since we can call as we please the units into
which we split the vouchers that represent the comrade’s claims to
consumers’ goods, we can also call them hours of labor. And since the total
number of these units is—within the limits set by convenience—no less
arbitrary we could make it equal to the hours actually worked, adjusting all
kinds and grades of labor to some standard quality in the Ricardo-Marxian
way. Finally our commonwealth can adopt, just as well as any other, the
principle that “incomes” should be proportional to the hours of standard
work contributed by each comrade. Then we should have a system of labor
notes. And the interesting point about it is that barring technical difficulties
which do not concern us now such a system would prove quite workable.
But it is easy to see why even then these “incomes” would not be “wages.”
It is no less obvious that the workability of such an arrangement does not
prove anything for the labor theory of value.
It is hardly necessary to perform the same operation on profits, interest,
prices and costs. The cause of that family likeness is by now clearly visible
without doing so: our socialism borrows nothing from capitalism, but
capitalism borrows much from the perfectly general logic of choice. Any
rational behavior must of course display certain formal similarities with any
other rational behavior, and it so happens that in the sphere of economic
behavior the molding influence of mere rationality goes pretty far, at least
with regard to the pure theory of it. The concepts which express the
behaviorist pattern are then drenched with all the particular meanings of a
historical epoch and will tend to retain, in the layman’s mind, the colors thus
acquired. If our historical acquaintance with economic phenomena had been
made in socialist environments, we should now seem to be borrowing
socialist concepts when analyzing a capitalist process.
So far, there is nothing for capitalist-minded economists to congratulate
themselves on in the discovery that socialism could after all only use
capitalist mechanisms and categories. There should be as little reason for
socialists to object. For only the most naïve mind can feel disappointed at
the fact that the socialist miracle does not create a logic of its own, and only
the crudest and most stupid variants of the socialist creed can be endangered
by any demonstration to that effect—those variants according to which the
capitalist process is nothing but a wild jumble without any logic or order at
all. Reasonable people of both persuasions can agree on such resemblance
as there is and remain just as far apart as ever. But an objection on the score
of terminology might remain: it may be argued that it is not convenient to
use terms loaded with adventitious yet very important meaning which not
everyone can be trusted to discard. Moreover, we must not forget that one
The Socialist Blueprint 183
may accept the result arrived at about the essential sameness of the economic
logic of socialist and commercial production and yet object to the particular
schema or model by means of which we have arrived at it (see below)
This is not all however. Some socialist as well as non-socialist economists
have been not only willing but anxious to recognize a particularly strong
family likeness between a socialist economy of the type envisaged and a
commercial economy of the perfectly competitive type. We might almost
speak of a school of socialist thought that tends to glorify perfect competition
and to advocate socialism on the ground that it offers the only method by
which the results of perfect competition can be attained in the modern world.
The tactical advantages to be reaped by placing oneself on this standpoint
are indeed obvious enough to explain what at first sight looks like surprising
broad-mindedness. A competent socialist who sees as clearly as any other
economist all the weaknesses of Marxian and of popular arguments can thus
admit whatever he feels should be admitted without compromising his
convictions because the admissions refer to a historical stage that (so far as
it ever did exist) is safely dead and buried; he is enabled, by judiciously
confining his condemnatory verdict to the non-competitive case, to lend
qualified support to some indictments, such as that in modern capitalism
production is for profit and not for the consumption of the people, which
otherwise would be merely silly; and he can baffle and puzzle good
bourgeois by telling them that socialism will only do what they really wanted
all along and what their own economic ulemas always taught them. But the
analytic advantages of stressing that family likeness are not equally great. 8
As we have already seen, the bloodless concept of perfect competition that
economic theory has framed for its purposes turns on whether or not individual
firms can, by their single-handed action, influence the prices of their products
and of their cost factors. If they cannot—that is, if each firm is a mere drop in
an ocean and therefore has to accept the prices that rule in the market—the
theorist speaks of perfect competition. And it can be shown that in this case the
mass effect of the passive reaction of all individual firms will result in market
prices and volumes of output displaying certain formal properties that are similar
to those of the indices of economic significance and volumes of output in our
blueprint of a socialist economy. However, in all that really matters—in the
principles governing the formation of incomes, the selection of industrial leaders,
the allocation of initiative and responsibility, the definition of success and
failure—in everything that constitutes the physiognomy of competitive
capitalism, the blueprint is the very opposite of perfect competition and much
further removed from it than from the big-business type of capitalism.
8 See ch. viii.
Can Socialism Survive?184
Though I do not think therefore that our blueprint can be objected to on the
ground that it is borrowed from commercialism or that it wastes socialist oil
in order to anoint that unholy thing, I am yet much in sympathy with those
socialists who object to it on other grounds. I have, it is true, pointed out
myself that the method of constructing a “market” of consumers’ goods and
of orienting production according to the indications derived from it will
come nearer than any other, for instance the method of decision by majority
vote, to giving each individual comrade what he wants—there exists no more
democratic institution than a market—and that in this sense it will result in
a “maximum of satisfaction.” But this maximum is only a short-run one 9 and,
moreover, is relative to the actual desires of the comrades as they are felt at
the moment. Only outright beefsteak socialism can be content with a goal
such as this. I cannot blame any socialist for despising it and dreaming of
new cultural forms for the human clay, perhaps of a new clay withal; the real
promise of socialism, if any, lies that way. Socialists who are of this mind
may still allow their commonwealth to be guided by the comrades’ actual
tastes in matters that present no other than the hedonist aspect. But they will
adopt a Gosplan not only, as we conditionally did ourselves, for their
investment policy but for all purposes that do present other aspects. They
may still let the comrades choose as they like between peas and beans. They
may well hesitate as to milk and whisky and as to drugs and improvement
of housing. And they will not allow comrades to choose between loafing and
temples—if the latter be allowed to stand for what Germans inelegantly but
tellingly call objective (manifestations of) culture.
6. It is therefore necessary to ask whether, if we jettison our “markets,”
rationality and determinateness do not go overboard also. The answer is
obvious. There would have to be an authority to do the evaluating, i.e., to
determine the indices of significance for all consumers’ goods. Given its
system of values, that authority could do this in a perfectly determined
manner exactly as a Robinson Crusoe can. 10 And the rest of the planning
process could then run its course, much as it did in our original blueprint.
The vouchers, prices, and the abstract units would still serve the purposes
of control and cost calculation, although they would lose their affinity to
disposable income and its units. All the concepts that derive from the general
logic of economic action would turn up again.
Any kind of centralist socialism, therefore, can successfully clear the first
hurdle—logical definiteness and consistency of socialist planning—and we
9 It is however a provable maximum and as such establishes the economic rationality of that
type of socialism exactly as the competitive maximum establishes the rationality of competitive
economy. And in neither case does this mean very much.
10 This is perhaps why Marx showed considerable interest in Crusoe economics.
The Socialist Blueprint 185
may as well negotiate the next one at once. It consists of the “practical
impossibility” on which, it seems, most anti-socialist economists are at
present inclined to retire after having accepted defeat on the purely logical
issue. They hold that our central board would be confronted with a task of
unmanageable complication,11 and some of them add that in order to function
the socialist arrangement would presuppose a wholesale reformation of souls
or of behavior—whichever way we prefer to style it—which historical
experience and common sense prove to be out of the question. Deferring
consideration of the latter point we can easily dispose of the former.
First, a glance at our solution of the theoretical problem will satisfy the
reader that it is eminently operational; that is to say, it not only establishes
a logical possibility but in doing so also shows the steps by which this
possibility can be realized in practice. This holds even if, in order to face
the issue squarely, we require that the plan of production be built up ab ovo,
i.e., without any previous experience as to quantities and values and on no
other basis to start from than a survey of the available resources and
technologies and a general knowledge about what kind of people the
comrades are. Moreover it must be borne in mind that under modern
conditions a socialist economy requires the existence of a huge bureaucracy
or at least social conditions favorable to its emergence and functioning. This
requirement constitutes one of the reasons why the economic problems of
socialism should never be discussed without reference to given states of the
social environment or to historical situations. Such an administrative
apparatus may or may not deserve all the derogatory comments which some
of us are in the habit of passing upon bureaucracy—we shall presently
comment upon it ourselves—but just now we are not concerned with the
question how well or ill it may be expected to fulfill its task; all that matters
is that, if it exists at all, there is no reason to believe that it will break down
under the task.
In any normal situation it would command information sufficient to
enable it to come at first throw fairly close to the correct quantities of output
in the major lines of production, and the rest would be a matter of
adjustments by informed trial and error. So far there is in this respect no very
fundamental difference 12 between socialist and commercial economies either
as to the problems which the theorist meets in showing how an economic
11 This is the line taken by most authors of non-socialist persuasion who accept the logical
credentials of socialism. Professors Robbins and von Hayek may be mentioned as the chief
authorities for this view.
12 Some writers seem to imply that the process by which equilibrium is reached would be
the same as in a state of perfect competition. That is not so however. Step-by-step adjustment
in reaction to price changes alone might easily miss the goal altogether. This is why in the text
I spoke of “informed” trial and error.
Can Socialism Survive?186
system proceeds to a state that could be “rational” or “optimal” in the sense
of fulfilling certain maximum conditions, or as to the problems which
managers have to meet in actual practice. If we admit previous experience
to start from as most socialists do and especially Karl Kautsky always did,
the task is of course greatly simplified, particularly if that experience is of
the big-business type.
But something else follows, secondly, from another inspection of our
blueprint: solution of the problems confronting the socialist management
would be not only just as possible as is the practical solution of the problems
confronting commercial managements: it would be easier. Of this we can
readily convince ourselves by observing that one of the most important
difficulties of running a business—the difficulty which absorbs most of the
energy of a successful business leader—consists in the uncertainties
surrounding every decision. A very important class of these consists in turn
in the uncertainties about the reaction of one’s actual and potential
competitors and about how general business situations are going to shape.
Although other classes of uncertainties would no doubt persist in a socialist
commonwealth, these two can reasonably be expected to vanish almost
completely. The managements of socialized industries and plants would be
in a position to know exactly what the other fellows propose to do and
nothing would prevent them from getting together for concerted action.13 The
central board could, and to a certain extent would unavoidably, act as a
clearing house of information and as a coordinator of decisions—at least as
much as an all-embracing cartel bureau would. This would immensely reduce
the amount of work to be done in the workshops of managerial brains and
much less intelligence would be necessary to run such a system than is
required to steer a concern of any importance through the waves and
breakers of the capitalist sea. This suffices to establish our proposition.
13 So far as this is being done in capitalist economies, it is a most important step toward
socialism. In fact, it progressively reduces the difficulties of transition and is in itself a symptom
of the advent of the transitional stage. To fight this tendency unconditionally is tantamount to
fighting socialism.

CHAPTER XVII
COMPARISON OF BLUEPRINTS
I. A P RELIMINARY P OINT
T HE reader who has followed so far will naturally expect me to embark
upon a comparative appraisal of the socialist plan. Perhaps it would be
wise to disappoint that expectation. For nobody who is not completely
lacking in a sense of responsibility can fail to see that comparison between
a system which we have lived with and a system which as yet is but a mental
image—no socialist will accept the Russian experience as a full-weight
realization—must be extremely hazardous. But we will take the risk, bearing
in mind all the time that beyond the realm of fact and argument over which
we are going to travel there is the realm of individual preferences,
convictions, evaluations into which we cannot enter. And we will improve
our chances of success by severely restricting our goal and frankly
recognizing difficulties and pitfalls.
In particular, we shall not compare the cultural worlds of commercial and
socialist society. What I have called the cultural indeterminateness of
socialism is in itself sufficient to bar the attempt. But we have also another
reason for refraining. Even if socialist civilization meant just one definite
pattern, comparative appraisal would still be a doubtful matter. There are
idealists and monomaniacs who can see no difficulty in it and gaily adopt
for a standard of comparison some feature which they value to the exclusion
of everything else and which they expect their socialism to display. But if
we resolved to do better than that and, so far as our vision may reach, to
see all the facets of a civilization in the light that is born and dies with it,
we should instantly discover that every civilization is a world unto itself, and
incommensurable with every other.
There is one point however that bears upon comparison of actual and
possible cultural achievement and yet comes within the scope of our type
of analysis. It is often claimed that the socialist plan, by removing economic
care from the shoulders of the individual, will release incalculable cultural
energies that now go to waste in the struggle for daily bread. To some extent
this is true—any “planned” society may do that as, for other reasons and in
other respects, it also may smother cultural possibilities. It might be objected
that public authorities as we know them are hardly up to the responsibility
Can Socialism Survive?188
of discovering and nursing talent to the stage of fruition, and that there is
no sound reason to believe that they would have appreciated Van Gogh any
sooner than capitalist society did. But this objection misses the point. For
public authority need not go as far as this. All that is necessary is that Van
Gogh gets his “income” as everyone else does and that he is not worked too
hard; this would suffice in any normal case—though, when I come to think
of it, I am no longer sure whether it would have sufficed in the case of Van
Gogh—to give the necessary opportunity for the assertion of creative ability.
But another objection carries more weight. In this matter as in others the
advocate of socialism is likely to overlook—often he is passionately resolved
not to admit—the degree to which certain ideals of his are satisfied in the
modern world. Capitalism provides, to a much greater extent than most of
us believe, the ladders for talent to climb. There is an element of truth in
the brutal slogan of the typical bourgeois which many worthy men find so
irritating, viz., that those who cannot climb by these ladders are not worth
troubling about. The ladders may not be up to any standard we choose to
set, but it cannot be said that they do not exist. Not only does modern
capitalism systematically proffer means to shelter and nurse almost any kind
of ability in the early stages of its development—so much so that in some
lines the difficulty is not how to find the means for talent but how to find
anything that has any claim to be called a talent for the means proffered—
but by the very law of its structure it tends to send up the able individual
and, much more effectively, the able family. Thus, though there may be
social losses 1 particularly in the class of semi-pathological genius, it is not
likely that they are very great.
II. A D ISCUSSION O F C OMPARATIVE E FFICIENCY
Let us stay however within the economic sphere though I hope I have made
it quite clear that I do not attribute to it more than secondary importance.
1. The restrictions of our scope are most obvious and hence the pitfalls
least dangerous at the first step which is still concerned with nothing but
blueprints. Again deferring discussion of transitional difficulties, to be dealt
with separately, and provisionally assuming that they have been successfully
overcome, we need only glance at the implications of our proof of the
possibility and practicability of the socialist schema in order to realize that
there is a strong case for believing in its superior economic efficiency.
That superiority need be proved only with respect to big-business or
1 Instances overstate by inference, even if they do not vanish on investigation as they often
do. Moreover, some of those losses occur independently of the particular organization of society;
not every such loss in the capitalist arrangement is also a loss through the capitalist
arrangement.
Comparison of Blueprints 189
“monopolistic” capitalism because superiority over “competitive”
capitalism then follows a fortiori. This is evident from our analysis in
Chapter VIII. Many economists, on the strength of the fact that under
completely unrealistic conditions all sorts of flattering propositions can
be established about competitive capitalism, have acquired a habit of
extolling it at the expense of its “monopolistic” successor. I wish to
repeat therefore that even if those eulogies were entirely justified—which
they are not—and if the theorist’s perfect competition had ever been
realized in the field of industry and transportation—which it never was—
finally, if all the accusations ever leveled against big business were
entirely justified—which is far from being the case—it would still be a
fact that the actual efficiency of the capitalist engine of production in the
era of the largest-scale units has been much greater than in the preceding
era of small or mediumsized ones. This is a matter of statistical record.
But if we recall the theoretical explanation of that fact, we further realize
that the increasing size of units of control and all the business strategy
that went with it were not only unavoidable incidents but to a
considerable extent also conditions of the achievement reflected in that
record; in other words, that the technological and organizational
possibilities open to firms of the type which is compatible with
approximately perfect competition could never have produced similar
results. How modern capitalism would work under perfect competition is
hence a meaningless question. Therefore, quite apart from the fact that
socialism will inherit a “monopolistic” and not a competitive capitalism,
we need not trouble about the competitive case except incidentally.
Economic efficiency of a system we will reduce to productive efficiency.
Even the latter is by no means easy to define. The two alternatives to be
compared must of course 2 be referred to the same point of time—past,
present or future. But this is not enough. For the relevant question is not
what, ex visu of a given point of time, socialist management could do with
the capitalist apparatus existing at that point of time—this is for us not much
more interesting than what socialist management could do with a given stock
of consumers’ goods—but what productive apparatus would exist or would
have existed had a socialist instead of the capitalist management presided
over its construction. The mass of information about our actual and potential
productive resources that has been accumulated during the last twenty years,
however valuable it may be for other purposes, thus lends but little aid in
2 This rule should be self-evident, yet it is frequently violated, For instance, the economic
performance of Soviet Russia at the present time is often compared with that of the tsarist
regime at the threshold of the First World War. But the lapse of a quarter of a century has robbed
such a comparison of all significance. The only comparison that could possibly be significant
would be with the values on an extrapolated trend based upon the figures for, say, 1800–1914.
Can Socialism Survive?190
the struggle with our difficulty. And all we can do is to list such differences
between the mechanisms of the economic engines of socialist and of
commercial society as we may nevertheless perceive, and to appraise their
importance as best we can.
We will postulate that the number, quality, tastes and age distribution of
the population at the time of comparison be the same in both cases. Then
we shall call that system relatively more efficient which we see reason to
expect would in the long run produce the larger stream of consumers’ goods
per equal unit of time. 3
2. This definition requires comment. It will be seen that it does not
identify economic efficiency with economic welfare or with given
degrees of satisfaction of wants. Even if any conceivable socialist
economy were sure to be in our sense less efficient than any conceivable
commercial economy, the majority of people—all in fact for whom the
typical socialist cares—might still be “better off” or “happier” or “more
content” in the former than in the latter. My first and main reply is that
relative efficiency retains independent meaning even in such cases and
that in all cases it will be an important consideration. But secondly I do
not think that we lose much by adopting a criterion that neglects those
aspects. This however is a very debatable matter on which it is just as
well to be a little more explicit.
To begin with, convinced socialists will derive satisfaction from the mere
3 Since the capitalist and the socialist streams of real income will to some extent consist
of different commodities and contain the commodities common to both in somewhat different
proportions—though in the absence of additional hypotheses about the change in the distribution
of spendable incomes it is impossible to estimate the importance of the difference—comparison
raises delicate questions of theory. If more wine and less bread are produced in the capitalist
than would be produced in the socialist society, which of the streams is the larger? In any
attempt to answer such a question, the difficulties incident to comparing income streams in the
same social framework from one year to the next (to constructing any index of total output,
that is) are met on a greatly magnified scale. For our purpose, however, the following definition
sufficiently meets the theoretical problem: one of the streams shall be called larger than the
other if, and only if, it yields a greater monetary total than the other, whichever of the two price
systems is used in the evaluation of both. If one stream yields a higher figure when both are
evaluated by means of say, the capitalist price system, and at the same time a smaller figure
when both are evaluated at the socialist price system, then we call them equal just as if they
actually yielded equal totals with both price systems—which simply means that we trust that
the difference will in general not be very significant in that case. The statistical problem is of
course not solved by this definition, because we cannot have the two streams before us at the
same time.
The reason why the words in the long run have been inserted in the sentence of the text
should be obvious from our analysis in ch. vii.
4 We are in fact sometimes invited to overlook admitted shortcomings of the socialist plan
for the sake of the privilege of becoming members of a socialist society. This argument, frankly
formulating as it does the truly socialist feeling, is by no means as unreasonable as it may
sound. It really renders all other arguments superfluous.
Comparison of Blueprints 191
fact of living in a socialist society. 4 Socialist bread may well taste sweeter
to them than capitalist bread simply because it is socialist bread, and it would
do so even if they found mice in it. If, moreover, the particular socialist
system adopted happens to agree with one’s moral principles as for instance
equalitarian socialism would with the moral principles of many socialists,
this fact and the consequent gratification of one’s sense of justice will of
course be listed among that system’s titles to superiority. For the working
of the system such moral allegiance is by no means indifferent; its
importance even for efficiency in our sense will have to be noticed later. But
beyond that all of us had better admit that our phraseology about justice and
so on reduces largely to whether we like a certain form of society or not.
There seems however to be a purely economic argument in favor of
equalitarian socialism or any socialism the structure of which admits of
greater equality of incomes. Those economists at least who feel no
compunction about treating satisfactions of wants as measurable quantities
and about comparing and adding the satisfactions of different persons have
a right to argue that a given stock or stream of consumers’ goods will in
general produce the maximum of satisfaction if equally distributed. An
equalitarian system as efficient as its commercial counterpart will hence
run at a higher level of welfare. Even a somewhat less efficient equalitarian
system might do so. Most modern theorists would discard this argument
on the grounds, that satisfactions are not measurable or that comparison
and addition of the satisfactions of different people are meaningless. We
need not go so far. It is sufficient to point out that the equalitarian argument
is particularly open to the objection raised in our analysis of monopolistic
practice: the problem is not how to distribute a quantity given
independently of the principles of income distribution. Wage incomes
might well be higher in a commercial society admitting unrestricted
inequalities than the equal incomes would be in equalitarian socialism. So
long as it is not made reasonably certain that the socialist engine of
production would be at least nearly as efficient as the commercial engine
is or was or can be expected to be at the time of the comparison, the
argument about distribution remains inconclusive—question-begging in
fact—even if we choose to accept it. 5 And as soon as the question of
productive efficiency is settled the distributive argument will in most cases
be superfluous; unless it be based exclusively on moral ideals, it will turn
the balance only in borderline cases.
5 The argument we thus discard may be made to read that other things being equal the
socialist maximum is greater than the competitive maximum. Owing to the purely formal nature
of both maxima however there is no point in comparing them, as should be obvious from

3. There is still another reason why similar levels of productive efficiency
might be associated with different levels of welfare. Most socialists will hold
that a given national income would go further in socialist than it goes in
capitalist society because the former would make a more economical use of
it. These economies follow from the fact that certain types of society may,
by virtue of their organization, be indifferent or adverse to purposes to which
other types, also by virtue of their organization, allocate considerable parts
of their resources. A pacifist socialism for instance would economize on
armaments, an atheist one on churches, and both might therefore have more
hospitals instead. This is so, of course. But since it involves valuations which
cannot with confidence be attributed to socialism in general—though they
could be to many individual socialists—it does not concern us here.
Almost any socialist society—not the Platonic type though—would surely
realize another type of economy, viz., the economy from the elimination of
the leisure class, the “idle rich.” Since from the socialist standpoint it is quite
proper to neglect the satisfactions accruing to the individuals belonging to
this group and to evaluate its cultural functions at zero—though civilized
socialists always save their faces by adding: in the world of today—there is
obviously a net gain to be made by the socialist regime. How much do we
lose by using an efficiency test which neglects this?
Of course, modern taxation of incomes and inheritance is rapidly reducing
the problem to quantitative insignificance, even independently of the fiscal
methods applied in financing the current war. But this taxation itself is the
expression of an anti-capitalist attitude and possibly the forerunner of complete
elimination of the typically capitalist income brackets. We must therefore put
our question for a capitalist society not yet attacked at its economic roots. For
this country, it seems reasonable to select the data of 1929. 6
Let us define rich people as those who have incomes of $50,000 and over.
In 1929, they received about 13 billion dollars out of a national total of about
93 billions.7 From these 13 billions we have to deduct taxes, savings, and gifts
for public purposes, because the elimination of these items would not constitute
economies for the socialist regime; it is only the expenditure of rich people for
their own consumption that would be “saved” in the proper sense of the word.8
6 The United States is the country that qualifies best for this test, In most European countries
the problem would be complicated, at least for the nineteenth century or even until 1914, by
the presence of high incomes which were of precapitalist origin but had been swelled by
capitalist evolution.
7 See H.G.Moulton, M.Levin, and C.A.Warburton, America’s Capacity to Consume
(1934), p. 206. These figures are admittedly extremely rough. They include incomes
from occupations and investments, also from sales of property and imputed returns from
owned homes.
8 It will be seen that the fact that the socialist authority would presumably use those savings
and gifts for different purposes does not affect the argument.

This expenditure cannot be estimated with any accuracy. All we can hope
for is an idea about the orders of magnitude involved. Since most economists
who have been willing to take the risk guessed at less than one-third of the
13 billions, it will be fairly safe to say that this expenditure did not amount
to more than 4? billions or to about 4.6 per cent of the total national income.
Now this 4.6 per cent includes all of the consumers’ expenditure from the
higher business and professional incomes, so that the idle rich cannot have
absorbed more than 1 or a per cent at the outside. And, so far as the family
motive is still alive, not even all of that can be considered irrelevant to
performance conducive to the efficiency of the economic engine.
Some readers will no doubt feel that the $50,000 limit is unduly high. It
is clear of course that more could be economized by eliminating or reducing
to a subsistence level the incomes of all the people who are, economically
speaking, idle whether rich or poor. 9 Still more could be economized, so one
would think, by rationalizing the distribution of all higher incomes so as to
bring them into closer correspondence with performance. But arguments to
be submitted in the next section suggest that the high hopes entertained on
that score are likely to meet with disappointment.
I do not wish however to insist. For if the reader should attach greater
importance to these economies than I think justified, the conclusion we are
going to arrive at will apply only a fortiori.

Thus our criterion of superiority or inferiority after all covers more ground
than it seems to. But if we stand by it, what is that strong case for the
superiority of the socialist blueprint of which I spoke before?
The reader who has perused the analysis in Chapter VIII may well wonder.
Most of the arguments usually advanced in support of the socialist and against
the capitalist regi2me, as we have seen, fail as soon as proper account is taken
of the conditions created for business by a rapid rate of progress. Some of
those arguments, on closer inspection, even turn out to cut the other way. Much
of what is being considered pathological is seen to be physiological—to fulfill
important functions in the process of creative destruction. Many wastes carry
9 It should however be noted that an income consisting exclusively of returns on investments
is no indication of the economic idleness of its receiver, because his work may be embodied
in his investments. The classroom illustration of this will serve as well as a longer argument
could: suppose a man reclaims a piece of land by the work of his hands; the return he will
thereafter receive is a “return on an appliance made by man” or, as economists call it, a quasi-
rent. If the improvement is permanent, it will become undistinguishable from the rent of land
proper and hence look like the very incarnation of unearned income whereas in reality it is a
form of wages if we define wages as returns attributable to personal productive exertions.
Generalizing, we may say that effort may be undergone in order to secure revenues which may,
but need not, take the form of wages.


compensations that sometimes completely, in other cases partly, invalidate the
inference. Socially irrational allocation of resources is not nearly as frequent
or important as it is made out to be. In some cases, moreover, it is no less likely
to occur in a socialist economy. Excess capacity, also partly inevitable in a
socialist economy, will often bear an interpretation which rebuts criticism. And
even unrelieved blemishes are after all but incidents of an achievement that is
great enough to cover a multitude of sins.
The answer so our question follows from the last paragraph of the preceding
chapter. It might be of doubtful validity as long as capitalist evolution is in
full swing but it will be decisive as soon as it permanently slackens down,
whether from reasons inherent in or external to its economic mechanism.
There are cases in which capitalist industries are so circumstanced that
prices and output become theoretically indeterminate. They may occur,
though they do not always occur, whenever there is oligopoly. In a socialist
economy everything—limiting cases without practical importance alone
excepted—is uniquely determined. But even when there exists a theoretically
determined state it is much more difficult and expensive to reach in the
capitalist economy than it would be in the socialist economy. In the former
endless moves and counter moves are necessary and decisions have to be
taken in an atmosphere of uncertainty that blunts the edge of action, whereas
that strategy and that uncertainty would be absent from the latter. That this
applies not only to “monopolistic” capitalism but, though for other reasons,
still more to the competitive species is shown by the hogcycle case 10 and by
the behavior of more or less perfectly competitive industries in general
depressions or in vicissitudes of their own.
But this means more than it seems to mean at first sight. Those
determinate solutions of the problems of production are rational or optimal
from the standpoint of given data, and anything that shortens, smoothens or
safeguards the road that leads to them is bound to save human energy and
material resources, and to reduce the costs at which a given result is attained.
Unless the resources thus saved are completely wasted, efficiency in our
sense must necessarily increase.
Under this heading some of the sweeping indictments of the capitalist
system which have been glanced at above acquire a qualified justification.
As an instance, take excess capacity. It is not true that it would be entirely
absent in socialism; it would be absurd for the central board to insist on full
utilization of a new railroad through as yet unsettled country. Nor is it true
that excess capacity spells loss in all cases. But there are types of excess
capacity which do spell loss and can be avoided by a socialist management,
10 See ch. viii.

Comparison of Blueprints 195

the chief case being that of reserve capacity for the purpose of economic
warfare. Whatever the importance of the particular case—I do not think it
is very considerable—it shows up a point to which I have already adverted:
there are things which within the conditions of capitalist evolution are, or
may be, perfectly rational and even necessary and therefore need not, ex visu
of the capitalist order, constitute blemishes at all; nor need they constitute
weaknesses of “monopolistic” as against competitive capitalism if they are
associated, as conditions, with achievements of the former that are out of the
reach of the latter; but even if that be so they may yet constitute weaknesses
as against the socialist blueprint.
This is particularly true of most of the phenomena that make up the
mechanism of trade cycles. Capitalist enterprise does not lack regulators,
some of which may well be met with again in the practice of the ministry
of production. But the planning of progress, in particular the systematic
coordination and orderly distribution in time of new ventures in all lines,
would be incomparably more effective in preventing bursts at some times and
depressive reactions at others than any automatic or manipulative variations
of the rate of interest or the supply of credit can be. In fact, it would
eliminate the cause of the cyclical ups and downs whereas in the capitalist
order it is only possible to mitigate them. And the process of discarding the
obsolete that in capitalism—especially in competitive capitalism—means
temporary paralysis and losses that are in part functionless, could be reduced
to what “discarding the obsolete” actually conveys to the layman’s mind
within a comprehensive plan providing in advance for the shifting to other
uses of the non-obsolete complements of the obsolete plants or pieces of
equipment. Concretely: a crisis centering in the cotton industry may in the
capitalist order put a stop to residential construction; in the socialist order it
may of course also happen that the production of cotton goods has to be
drastically curtailed at short notice, though it is not so likely to happen; but
this would be a reason to speed up residential construction instead of
stopping it.

Whatever the economic goals desired by whoever is in the position to
give effect to his desires, socialist management could attain them with less
disturbance and loss without necessarily incurring the disadvantages that
would attend attempts at planning progress within the framework of
capitalist institutions. One aspect of this might be expressed by saying that
the socialist management could steer a course approximating the long-run
trend of output, thus developing a tendency which as we have seen is not
foreign to big-business policy. And the whole of our argument might be
put in a nutshell by saying that socialization means a stride beyond big
business on the way that has been chalked out by it or, what amounts to the same thing, that socialist management may conceivably prove as
superior to big-business capitalism as big-business capitalism has proved
to be to the kind of competitive capitalism of which the English industry
of a hundred years ago was the prototype. It is quite possible that future
generations will look upon arguments about the inferiority of the socialist
plan as we look upon Adam Smith’s arguments about joint-stock
companies which, also, were not simply false.
Of course, all that I have said so far refers exclusively to the logic of
blueprints, hence to “objective” possibilities which socialism in practice may
be quite unable to realize. But as a matter of blueprint logic it is undeniable
that the socialist blueprint is drawn at a higher level of rationality. This, I
believe, is the correct way of putting the matter. It is not a case of rationality
versus irrationality. The farmer whose reaction to hog and fodder prices
produces the hog cycle is, individually and from the standpoint of the
moment, acting perfectly rationally. So is the management of a concern that
maneuvers in an oligopolistic situation. So is the firm that expands in the
boom and restricts in recession. It is the kind and scope of rationality that
makes the difference.
This is certainly not all that can be adduced on behalf of the socialist
plan. But so far as the pure logic of a socialist economy is concerned,
most arguments that are not provably wrong are in fact implied in the
one submitted.
An example of the first importance is afforded by unemployment. We
have seen in Part II that, as regards the interest of the unemployed
themselves, capitalist society in any stage sufficiently advanced to offer a
chance for successful socialization need and presumably will not leave very
much to be desired. But concerning the loss to society the preceding
argument implies that in a socialist society unemployment will be less,
mainly in consequence of the elimination of depressions, and that where it
does occur, mainly in consequence of technological improvement, the
ministry of production will be in a position—whatever it may actually do—
to redirect the men to other employments which, if the planning lives up to
its possibilities at all, might in each case be waiting for them.
A minor advantage that is also implied in the superior rationality of the
socialist plan results from the fact that in the capitalist order improvements
occur as a rule in individual concerns and take time and meet resistance in
spreading. If the pace of progress is rapid, there is often a large number of
firms that cling to old methods or are otherwise of substandard efficiency.
In the socialist order every improvement could theoretically be spread by
decree and substandard practice could be promptly eliminated. I call this a
minor advantage because capitalism as a rule also deals pretty efficiently
Comparison of Blueprints 197
with the inefficient. Of course, the likelihood of this particular advantage,
whether great or small, being realized by a bureaucracy is another matter; a
decent bureaucracy may always be relied on to bring all its members up to
its standard, but this says nothing about what this standard itself will be. That
possible superiorities might in practice turn into actual inferiorities must be
kept in mind throughout.
Again, managers or owner-managers of small or medium-sized concerns
are as a rule primarily either engineers or salesmen or organizers and, even
if good men, rarely do all things equally well. We often find that even
successful businesses are indifferently managed in some respect or other—
witness the reports of efficiency experts—and their leaders are therefore
partially misplaced. The socialist economy could, as modern largest-scale
business does, use them to fuller advantage by using them exclusively in
what they really know how to do. But obvious considerations that need not
detain us will not allow us to entertain high hopes on that score.
There is however an advantage of prime importance that is not visible in
our blueprint as drawn. The outstanding feature of commercial society is the
division between the private and the public sphere—or, if you prefer, the fact
that in commercial society there is a private sphere which contains so much
more than either feudal or socialist society allocates to it. This private sphere
is distinct from the public sphere not only conceptually but also actually. The
two are to a great extent manned by different people—the history of local
self-government offering the most conspicuous exception—and organized as
well as run on different and often conflicting principles, productive of
different and often incompatible standards.
Friction can only temporarily be absent from such an arrangement the
paradoxical nature of which would be a source of wonder to us if we
were not so accustomed to it. As a matter of fact, friction was present
long before it developed into antagonism in consequence of the wars of
conquest waged upon the bourgeois domain with ever-increasing success
by the men of the public sphere. This antagonism entails struggle. Most
activities of the state in the economic field then appear in the light that
is well characterized by the old bourgeois economist’s phrase,
government interference. These activities do in fact interfere in every
sense of the word, especially in the sense that they hamper and paralyze
the private engine of production. It cannot be urged that they are
frequently successful, even in increasing productive efficiency. But as far
as they are, the central board’s activity would stand a still greater chance
of being so, whereas the costs and losses incident to the struggle as such
would be entirely avoided in the socialist case. And these losses are
considerable, especially if we count in all the worry caused by incessant
Can Socialism Survive?198
inquiries and prosecutions and the consequent discouraging effects on the
energies that propel business.
One element of these costs should be mentioned specifically. It consists
in the absorption of ability in merely protective activities. A considerable part
of the total work done by lawyers goes into the struggle of business with
the state and its organs. It is immaterial whether we call this vicious
obstruction of the common good or defense of the common good against
vicious obstruction. In any case the fact remains that in socialist society there
would be neither need nor room for this part of legal activity. The resulting
saving is not satisfactorily measured by the fees of the lawyers who are thus
engaged. That is inconsiderable. But not inconsiderable is the social loss
from such unproductive employment of many of the best brains. Considering
how terribly rare good brains are, their shifting to other employments might
be of more than infinitesimal importance.
The friction or antagonism between the private and the public sphere was
intensified from the first by the fact that, ever since the princes’ feudal
incomes ceased to be of major importance, the state has been living on a
revenue which was being produced in the private sphere for private purposes
and had to be deflected from these purposes by political force. 11 On the one
hand, taxation is an essential attribute of commercial society—or, if we
accept the conception of the state alluded to in the first chapter, of the state—
and, on the other hand, it is almost inevitably 12 in the nature of an injury to
the productive process. Until 1914 roughly—if we agree to consider modern
times only—that injury was confined within narrow bounds. But since then
taxes have grown, by degrees, into the dominant item of business and family
budgets and into a major factor in the explanation of unsatisfactory economic
performance. Moreover, in order to wrench ever-increasing amounts from an
unwilling organism, a huge administrative apparatus has come into existence
that does nothing but struggle with the bourgeoisie for every dollar of its
revenue. That organism has in response developed organs of defense and
does an immense amount of work in self-protection.
Nothing else brings out so well the wastes that result from the conflict
of structural principles in a social body. Modern capitalism relies on the
profit principle for its daily bread yet refuses to allow it to prevail. No such
conflict, consequently no such wastes, would exist in socialist society. Since
it would control all sources of revenue, taxes could vanish with the state or,
if my conception of the state does not command approval, with the bourgeois
11 The theory which construes taxes on the analogy of club dues or of the purchase of the
services of, say, a doctor only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from
scientific habits of mind.
12 Exceptions exist, but they do not matter for practical purposes.

state. For, as a matter of common sense, it would be clearly absurd for the
central board to pay out incomes first and, after having done so, to run after
the recipients in order to recover part of them. If radicals were not so fond
of chivying the bourgeois that they cannot see anything wrong in taxes
except that they are too low, it would have been recognized before this that
here we have got hold of one of the most significant titles to superiority that
can be advanced in favor of the socialist plan.
