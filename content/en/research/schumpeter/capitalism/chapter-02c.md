<!-- The task of piecing together such fragments is delicate and cannot be
attempted here. The basic idea is clear enough, however.  -->

The stratifying principle consists in the ownership, or the exclusion from ownership, of means of production such as factory buildings, machinery, raw materials and the consumers’ goods that enter into the workman’s budget. 

There are thus only 2 classes:

1. The owners, the capitalists
2. The have-nots as the laboring class or proletariat

The have-nots are compelled to sell their labor. 

The existence of intermediate groups, such as are formed by farmers or artisans who employ labor but also do manual work, by clerks
and by the professions is of course not denied; but they are treated as
anomalies which tend to disappear in the course of the capitalist process. 

The
two fundamental classes are, by virtue of the logic of their position and quite
independently of any individual volition, essentially antagonistic to each
other. 

Rifts within each class and collisions between subgroups occur and
may even have historically decisive importance. But in the last analysis, such
rifts or collisions are incidental. The one antagonism that is not incidental
but inherent in the basic design of capitalist society is founded upon the
private control over the means to produce: the very nature of the relation
between the capitalist class and the proletariat is strife—class war.

Marx shows how in that class war capitalists destroy each other and eventually will destroy the capitalist system too.*

He also tries to show how the ownership of capital leads to further accumulation. 

But this way of arguing as well as the very definition that makes the ownership of something the constituent characteristic of a social class only
serves to increase the importance of the question of “primitive accumulation,”
that is to say, of the question how capitalists came to be capitalists in the first
instance or how they acquired that stock of goods which according to the
Marxian doctrine was necessary in order to enable them to start exploiting. On
this question Marx is much less explicit. 8 

<!-- 7 Another example is the socialist theory of imperialism which will be noticed later on.
O.Bauer’s interesting attempt to interpret the antagonisms between the various races that
inhabited the Austro-Hungarian Empire in terms of the class struggle between capitalists and
workers (Die Nationalitätenfrage, 1905) also deserves to be mentioned, although the skill of
the analyst only serves to show up the inadequacy of the tool. -->


He contemptuously rejects the
bourgeois nursery tale (Kinderfibel) that some people rather than others
became, and are still becoming every day, capitalists by superior intelligence
and energy in working and saving. 

He was well advised to sneer at that
story about the good boys. For to call for a guffaw is no doubt an excellent
method of disposing of an uncomfortable truth, as every politician knows to
his profit. Nobody who looks at historical and contemporaneous fact with
anything like an unbiased mind can fail to observe that this children’s tale,
while far from telling the whole truth, yet tells a good deal of it. 

Supernormal
intelligence and energy account for industrial success and in particular for the
founding of industrial positions in nine cases out of ten. And precisely in the
initial stages of capitalism and of every individual industrial career, saving was
and is an important element in the process though not quite as explained in
classic economics. It is true that one does not ordinarily attain the status of
capitalist (industrial employer) by saving from a wage or salary in order to
equip one’s factory by means of the fund thus assembled. 

The bulk of
accumulation comes from profits and hence presupposes profits—this is in fact
the sound reason for distinguishing saving from accumulating. The means
required in order to start enterprise are typically provided by borrowing other
people’s savings, the presence of which in many small puddles is easy to
explain or the deposits which banks create for the use of the would-be
entrepreneur. 

Nevertheless, the latter does save as a rule: the function of his
saving is to raise him above the necessity of submitting to daily drudgery for
the sake of his daily bread and to give him breathing space in order to look
around, to develop his plans and to secure cooperation. As a matter of
economic theory, therefore, Marx had a real case—though he overstated it—
when he denied to saving the role that the classical authors attributed to it.
Only his inference does not follow. And the guffaw is hardly more justified
than it would be if the classical theory were correct.9

The guffaw did its work, however, and helped to clear the road for Marx’s
alternative theory of primitive accumulation. But this alternative theory is not
as definite as we might wish. 

Force—robbery—subjugation of the masses
facilitating their spoliation and the results of the pillage in turn facilitating
subjugation—this was all right of course and admirably tallied with ideas
common among intellectuals of all types, in our day still more than in the
day of Marx. But evidently it does not solve the problem, which is to explain
how some people acquired the power to subjugate and to rob. 

Popular
literature does not worry about it. I should not think of addressing the
question to the writings of John Reed. But we are dealing with Marx.
Now at least the semblance of a solution is afforded by the historical
quality of all the major theories of Marx. For him, it is essential for the logic
of capitalism, and not only a matter of fact, that it grew out of a feudal state
of society. 

<!-- 8 See Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xxvi: “The Secret of Primitive Accumulation.”
9 I will not stay to stress, though I must mention, that even the classical theory is not as
wrong as Marx pretended it was. “Saving up” in the most literal sense has been, especially in
earlier stages of capitalism, a not unimportant method of “original accumulation.” Moreover,
there was another method that was akin to it though not identical with Many a factory in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was just a shed that a man was able to put up by the work
of his hands, and required only the simplest equipment to work it. In such cases the manual
work of the prospective capitalist plus a quite small fund of savings was all that was needed—
and brains, of course. -->


Of course the same question about the causes and the mechanism
of social stratification arises also in this case, but Marx substantially accepted
the bourgeois view that feudalism was a reign of force 10 in which subjugation
and exploitation of the masses were already accomplished facts. 

The class
theory devised primarily for the conditions of capitalist society was extended
to its feudal predecessor—as was much of the conceptual apparatus of the
economic theory of capitalism 11 —and some of the most thorny problems
were stowed away in the feudal compound to reappear in a settled state, in
the form of data, in the analysis of the capitalist pattern. 

The feudal exploiter
was simply replaced by the capitalist exploiter. In those cases in which feudal
lords actually turned into industrialists, this alone would solve what is thus
left of the problem. Historical evidence lends a certain amount of support
to this view: many feudal lords, particularly in Germany, in fact did erect
and run factories, often providing the financial means from their feudal rents
and the labor from the agricultural population (not necessarily but sometimes
their serfs). 12 In all other cases the material available to stop the gap is
distinctly inferior. The only frank way of expressing the situation is that from
a Marxian standpoint there is no satisfactory explanation, that is to say, no
explanation without resorting to non-Marxian elements suggestive of non-

<!-- 10 Many socialist writers besides Marx have displayed that uncritical confidence in the
explanatory value of the element of force and of the control over the physical means with which
to exert force. Ferdinand Lassalle, for instance, has little beyond cannons and bayonets to offer
by way of explanation of governmental authority. It is a source of wonder to me that so many
people should be blind to the weakness of such a sociology and to the fact that it would
obviously be much truer to say that power leads to control over cannons (and men willing to
use them) than that control over cannons generates power.
11 This constitutes one of the affinities of the teaching of Marx to that of K.
Rodbertus.
12 W.Sombart, in the first edition of his Theorie des modernen Kapitalismus, tried to
make the most of those cases. But the attempt to base primitive accumu lation entirely
on the accumulation of ground rent showed its hopelessness as Sombart himself
eventually recognized. -->


This, however, vitiates the theory at both its historical and its logical
source. Since most of the methods of primitive accumulation also account
for later accumulation—primitive accumulation, as it were, continues
throughout the capitalist era—it is not possible to say that Marx’s theory of
social classes is all right except for the difficulties about processes in a distant
past. But it is perhaps superfluous to insist on the shortcomings of a theory
which not even in the most favorable instances goes anywhere near the heart
of the phenomenon it undertakes to explain, and which never should have
been taken seriously. 

These instances are to be found mainly in that epoch
of capitalist evolution which derived its character from the prevalence of the
medium-sized owner-managed firm. Beyond the range of that type, class
positions, though in most cases reflected in more or less corresponding
economic positions, are more often the cause than the consequence of the
latter: business achievement is obviously not everywhere the only avenue to
social eminence and only where it is can ownership of means of production
causally determine a group’s position in the social structure. 

Even then,
however, it is as reasonable to make that ownership the defining element as
it would be to define a soldier as a man who happens to have a gun. The
water-tight division between people who (together with their descendants)
are supposed to be capitalists once for all and others who (together with their
descendants) are supposed to be proletarians once for all is not only, as has
often been pointed out, utterly unrealistic but it misses the salient point about
social classes—the incessant rise and fall of individual families into and out
of the upper strata. The facts I am alluding to are all obvious and
indisputable. If they do not show on the Marxian canvas, the reason can only
be in their un-Marxian implications.

What is the role which that theory plays within Marx’s structure?

What analytic intention—as distinguished from its use as a piece of equipment for the agitator—he meant
it to serve?

For Marx, the theory of Social Classes and the Economic Interpretation of History were not what they are
for us, viz., two independent doctrines. 

With Marx, the former implements
the latter in a particular way and thus restricts—makes more definite—the
modus operandi of the conditions or forms of production. These determine
the social structure and, through the social structure, all manifestations of

<!-- 13 This holds true even if we admit robbery to the utmost extent to which it is possible to
do so without trespassing upon the sphere of the intellectual’s folklore. Robbery actually entered
into the building up of commercial capital at many times and places. Phoenician as well as
English wealth offers familiar examples. But even then the Marxian explanation is inadequate
because in the last resort successful robbery must rest on the personal superiority of the robbers.
And as soon as this is admitted, a very different theory of social stratification suggests itself. -->


civilization and the whole march of cultural and political history. But the
social structure is, for all non-socialist epochs, defined in terms of classes—
those two classes—which are the true dramatis personae and at the same time
the only immediate creatures of the logic of the capitalist system of
production which affects everything else through them. This explains why
Marx was forced to make his classes purely economic phenomena, and even
phenomena that were economic in a very narrow sense: he thereby cut
himself off from a deeper view of them, but in the precise spot of his analytic
schema in which he placed them he had no choice but to do so.
On the other hand, Marx wished to define capitalism by the same trait
that also defines his class division. A little reflection will convince the
reader that this is not a necessary or natural thing to do. In fact it was a
bold stroke of analytic strategy which linked the fate of the class
phenomenon with the fate of capitalism in such a way that socialism,
which in reality has nothing to do with the presence or absence of social
classes, became, by definition, the only possible kind of classless society,
excepting primitive groups. This ingenious tautology could not equally
well have been secured by any definitions of classes and of capitalism
other than those chosen by Marx—the definition by private ownership of
means of production. Hence there had to be just two classes, owners and
non-owners, and hence all other principles of division, much more
plausible ones among them, had to be severely neglected or discounted
or else reduced to that one.

The exaggeration of the definiteness and importance of the dividing line
between the capitalist class in that sense and the proletariat was surpassed
only by the exaggeration of the antagonism between them. To any mind not
warped by the habit of fingering the Marxian rosary it should be obvious
that their relation is, in normal times, primarily one of cooperation and that
any theory to the contrary must draw largely on pathological cases for
verification. In social life, antagonism and synagogism are of course both
ubiquitous and in fact inseparable except in the rarest of cases. But I am
almost tempted to say that there was, if anything, less of absolute nonsense
in the old harmonistic view—full of nonsense though that was too—than in
the Marxian construction of the impassable gulf between tool owners and
tool users. Again, however, he had no choice, not because he wanted to arrive
at revolutionary results—these he could have derived just as well from
dozens of other possible schemata—but because of the requirements of his
own analysis. If class struggle was the subject matter of history and also the
means of bringing about the socialist dawn, and if there had to be just those
two classes, then their relation had to be antagonistic on principle or else the
force in his system of social dynamics would have been lost.


Though Marx defines capitalism sociologically, i.e., by the institution
of private control over means of production, the mechanics of capitalist
society are provided by his economic theory. This economic theory is to
show how the sociological data embodied in such conceptions as class, class
interest, class behavior, exchange between classes, work out through the
medium of economic values, profits, wages, investment, etc., and how they
generate precisely the economic process that will eventually break its own
institutional framework and at the same time create the conditions for the
emergence of another social world. This particular theory of social classes
is the analytic tool which, by linking the economic interpretation of history
with the concepts of the profit economy, marshals all social facts, makes all
phenomena confocal. 

It is therefore not simply a theory of an individual
phenomenon which is to explain that phenomenon and nothing else. It has
an organic function which is really much more important to the Marxian
system than the measure of success with which it solves its immediate
problem. This function must be seen if we are to understand how an analyst
of the power of Marx could ever have borne with its shortcomings.
There are, and always have been, some enthusiasts who admired the
Marxian theory of social classes as such. But far more understandable are
the feelings of all those who admire the force and grandeur of that synthesis
as a whole to the point of being ready to condone almost any number of
shortcomings in the component parts. We shall try to appraise it for ourselves
(Chapter IV). But first we must see how Marx’s economic mechanics acquits
itself of the task that his general plan imposes upon it.
