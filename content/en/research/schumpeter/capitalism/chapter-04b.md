Marx’s synthesis embraces:
- all those historical events—such as wars, revolutions, legislative changes
- all those social institutions—such as property, contractual relations, forms of government


Non-Marxian economists are treat these as disturbing factors or as
data, which means that they do not propose to explain them but only to
analyze their modi operandi and consequences. 

Such factors or data are of course necessary in order to delimit the object and range of any research
program whatsoever. 

If they are not always expressly specified, that is only
because everyone is expected to know what they are. The trait peculiar to
the Marxian system is that it subjects those historical events and social
institutions themselves to the explanatory process of economic analysis or,
to use the technical lingo, that it treats them not as data but as variables.

Thus the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the American Civil War, the
World War of 1914, the French Frondes, the great French Revolution, the
revolutions of 1830 and 1848, English free trade, the labor movement as a
whole as well as any of its particular manifestations, colonial expansion,
institutional changes, the national and party politics of every time and
country—all this enters the domain of Marxian economics which claims to
find theoretical explanations in terms of class warfare, of attempts at and
revolt against exploitation, of accumulation and of qualitative change in the
capital structure, of changes in the rate of surplus value and in the rate of
profit. No longer has the economist to be content with giving technical
answers to technical questions; instead, he teaches humanity the hidden
meaning of its struggles. 

No longer is “politics” an independent factor that
may and must be abstracted from in an investigation of fundamentals and,
when it does intrude, plays according to one’s preferences either the role of
a naughty boy who viciously tampers with a machine when the engineer’s
back is turned, or else the role of a deus ex machina by virtue of the
mysterious wisdom of a doubtful species of mammals deferentially referred
to as “statesmen.” No—politics itself is being determined by the structure
and state of the economic process and becomes a conductor of effects as
completely within the range of economic theory as any purchase or sale.
Once more, nothing is easier to understand than the fascination exerted by
a synthesis which does for us just this. It is particularly understandable in the
young and in those intellectual denizens of our newspaper world to whom the
gods seem to have granted the gift of eternal youth. Panting with impatience
to have their innings, longing to save the world from something or other,
disgusted with textbooks of un-describable tedium, dissatisfied emotionally and
intellectually, unable to achieve synthesis by their own effort, they find what
they crave for in Marx. There it is, the key to all the most intimate secrets,
the magic wand that marshals both great events and small. They are beholding an explanatory schema that at the same time is—if I may for a moment lapse
into Hegelianism—most general and most concrete. They need no longer feel
out of it in the great affairs of life—all at once they see through the pompous
marionettes of politics and business who never know what it is all about. And
who can blame them, considering available alternatives?

Yes, of course—but apart from that, what does this service of the
Marxian synthesis amount to? I wonder. The humble economist who
describes England’s transition to free trade or the early achievements of
English factory legislation is not, and never was, likely to forget to mention
the structural conditions of the English economy that produced those
policies. If he does not do so in a course or book on pure theory that
merely makes for neater and and more efficient analysis. What the Marxist
has to add is only the insistence on the principle, and a particularly narrow
and warped theory by which to implement it. This theory yields results no
doubt, and very simple and definite ones to boot. But we need only apply
it systematically to individual cases in order to grow thoroughly weary of
the unending jingle about the class war between owners and non-owners
and to become aware of a painful sense of inadequacy or, worse still, of
triviality—of the former, if we do not swear by the underlying schema; of
the latter, if we do.

Marxists are in the habit of pointing triumphantly to the success of the
Marxian diagnosis of the economic and social tendencies that are supposed
to be inherent in capitalist evolution. 

There is some
justification for this: more clearly than any other writer of his day Marx
discerned the trend toward big business and not only that but also some of
the features of the consequent situations. We have also seen that in this case
vision lent its aid to analysis so as to remedy some of the shortcomings of
the latter and to make the import of the synthesis truer than the contributing
elements of the analysis were themselves. But this is all. And against the
achievement must be set the failure of the prediction of increasing misery,
the joint result of wrong vision and faulty analysis, on which a great many
Marxian speculations about the future course of social events had been
based, He who places his trust in the Marxian synthesis as a whole in order
to understand present situations and problems is apt to be woefully wrong. 2
This seems in fact to be felt by many a Marxist just now.

2 Some Marxists would reply that non-Marxian economists have simply nothing to contribute
to our understanding of our time so that the disciple of Marx is nevertheless better off in that
respect. Waiving the question of whether it is better to say nothing or to say something that is
wrong, we should bear in mind that this is not true, for both economists and sociologists of
non-Marxian persuasions have as a matter of fact contributed substantially though mostly on
individual questions. Least of all can this Marxist claim be based on a comparison of Marx’s
teachings with that of the Austrians or of the Walras or Marshall schools. The members of these

In particular there is no reason for taking pride in the manner in which
the Marxian synthesis accounts for the experience of the last decade. Any
prolonged period of depression or of unsatisfactory recovery will verify
any pessimistic forecast exactly as well as it verifies the Marxian one. In
this case an impression to the contrary is created by the talk of
disheartened bourgeois and elated intellectuals which naturally acquired a
Marxian hue from their fears and hopes. But no actual fact warrants any
specifically Marxian diagnosis, still less an inference to the effect that what
we have been witnessing was not simply a depression, but the symptoms
of a structural change in the capitalist process such as Marx expected to
occur. For, as will be noted in the next part, all the phenomena observed
such as supernormal unemployment, lack of investment opportunity,
shrinkage of money values, losses and so on, come within the well-known
pattern of periods of predominating depression such as the seventies and
eighties on which Engels commented with a restraint that should set an
example to ardent followers of today.
