The tactical advantages to be reaped by placing oneself on this standpoint
are indeed obvious enough to explain what at first sight looks like surprising
broad-mindedness. A competent socialist who sees as clearly as any other
economist all the weaknesses of Marxian and of popular arguments can thus
admit whatever he feels should be admitted without compromising his
convictions because the admissions refer to a historical stage that (so far as
it ever did exist) is safely dead and buried; he is enabled, by judiciously
confining his condemnatory verdict to the non-competitive case, to lend
qualified support to some indictments, such as that in modern capitalism
production is for profit and not for the consumption of the people, which
otherwise would be merely silly; and he can baffle and puzzle good bourgeois by telling them that socialism will only do what they really wanted
all along and what their own economic ulemas always taught them. 

But the analytic advantages of stressing that family likeness are not equally great. 8
As we have already seen, the bloodless concept of perfect competition that
economic theory has framed for its purposes turns on whether or not individual
firms can, by their single-handed action, influence the prices of their products
and of their cost factors. If they cannot—that is, if each firm is a mere drop in
an ocean and therefore has to accept the prices that rule in the market—the
theorist speaks of perfect competition. And it can be shown that in this case the
mass effect of the passive reaction of all individual firms will result in market
prices and volumes of output displaying certain formal properties that are similar
to those of the indices of economic significance and volumes of output in our
blueprint of a socialist economy. However, in all that really matters—in the
principles governing the formation of incomes, the selection of industrial leaders,
the allocation of initiative and responsibility, the definition of success and
failure—in everything that constitutes the physiognomy of competitive
capitalism, the blueprint is the very opposite of perfect competition and much
further removed from it than from the big-business type of capitalism.


Though I do not think therefore that our blueprint can be objected to on the
ground that it is borrowed from commercialism or that it wastes socialist oil
in order to anoint that unholy thing, I am yet much in sympathy with those
socialists who object to it on other grounds. I have, it is true, pointed out
myself that the method of constructing a “market” of consumers’ goods and
of orienting production according to the indications derived from it will
come nearer than any other, for instance the method of decision by majority
vote, to giving each individual comrade what he wants—there exists no more
democratic institution than a market—and that in this sense it will result in
a “maximum of satisfaction.” But this maximum is only a short-run one 9 and,
moreover, is relative to the actual desires of the comrades as they are felt at
the moment. Only outright beefsteak socialism can be content with a goal
such as this. I cannot blame any socialist for despising it and dreaming of
new cultural forms for the human clay, perhaps of a new clay withal; the real
promise of socialism, if any, lies that way. Socialists who are of this mind
may still allow their commonwealth to be guided by the comrades’ actual
tastes in matters that present no other than the hedonist aspect. But they will
adopt a Gosplan not only, as we conditionally did ourselves, for their
investment policy but for all purposes that do present other aspects. They
may still let the comrades choose as they like between peas and beans. They
may well hesitate as to milk and whisky and as to drugs and improvement
of housing. And they will not allow comrades to choose between loafing and
temples—if the latter be allowed to stand for what Germans inelegantly but
tellingly call objective (manifestations of) culture.

6. It is therefore necessary to ask whether, if we jettison our “markets,”
rationality and determinateness do not go overboard also. The answer is
obvious. There would have to be an authority to do the evaluating, i.e., to
determine the indices of significance for all consumers’ goods. Given its
system of values, that authority could do this in a perfectly determined
manner exactly as a Robinson Crusoe can. 10 And the rest of the planning
process could then run its course, much as it did in our original blueprint.
The vouchers, prices, and the abstract units would still serve the purposes
of control and cost calculation, although they would lose their affinity to
disposable income and its units. All the concepts that derive from the general
logic of economic action would turn up again.

<!-- 9 It is however a provable maximum and as such establishes the economic rationality of that
type of socialism exactly as the competitive maximum establishes the rationality of competitive
economy. And in neither case does this mean very much.
10 This is perhaps why Marx showed considerable interest in Crusoe economics. -->


Any kind of centralist socialism, therefore, can successfully clear the first
hurdle—logical definiteness and consistency of socialist planning—and we may as well negotiate the next one at once. It consists of the “practical
impossibility” on which, it seems, most anti-socialist economists are at
present inclined to retire after having accepted defeat on the purely logical
issue. They hold that our central board would be confronted with a task of
unmanageable complication,11 and some of them add that in order to function
the socialist arrangement would presuppose a wholesale reformation of souls
or of behavior—whichever way we prefer to style it—which historical
experience and common sense prove to be out of the question. Deferring
consideration of the latter point we can easily dispose of the former.
First, a glance at our solution of the theoretical problem will satisfy the
reader that it is eminently operational; that is to say, it not only establishes
a logical possibility but in doing so also shows the steps by which this
possibility can be realized in practice. This holds even if, in order to face
the issue squarely, we require that the plan of production be built up ab ovo,
i.e., without any previous experience as to quantities and values and on no
other basis to start from than a survey of the available resources and
technologies and a general knowledge about what kind of people the
comrades are. Moreover it must be borne in mind that under modern
conditions a socialist economy requires the existence of a huge bureaucracy
or at least social conditions favorable to its emergence and functioning. This
requirement constitutes one of the reasons why the economic problems of
socialism should never be discussed without reference to given states of the
social environment or to historical situations. Such an administrative
apparatus may or may not deserve all the derogatory comments which some
of us are in the habit of passing upon bureaucracy—we shall presently
comment upon it ourselves—but just now we are not concerned with the
question how well or ill it may be expected to fulfill its task; all that matters
is that, if it exists at all, there is no reason to believe that it will break down
under the task.

In any normal situation it would command information sufficient to
enable it to come at first throw fairly close to the correct quantities of output
in the major lines of production, and the rest would be a matter of
adjustments by informed trial and error. So far there is in this respect no very
fundamental difference 12 between socialist and commercial economies either
as to the problems which the theorist meets in showing how an economic system proceeds to a state that could be “rational” or “optimal” in the sense
of fulfilling certain maximum conditions, or as to the problems which
managers have to meet in actual practice. If we admit previous experience
to start from as most socialists do and especially Karl Kautsky always did,
the task is of course greatly simplified, particularly if that experience is of
the big-business type.

<!-- 11 This is the line taken by most authors of non-socialist persuasion who accept the logical
credentials of socialism. Professors Robbins and von Hayek may be mentioned as the chief
authorities for this view.
12 Some writers seem to imply that the process by which equilibrium is reached would be
the same as in a state of perfect competition. That is not so however. Step-by-step adjustment
in reaction to price changes alone might easily miss the goal altogether. This is why in the text
I spoke of “informed” trial and error. -->

But something else follows, secondly, from another inspection of our
blueprint: solution of the problems confronting the socialist management
would be not only just as possible as is the practical solution of the problems
confronting commercial managements: it would be easier. Of this we can
readily convince ourselves by observing that one of the most important
difficulties of running a business—the difficulty which absorbs most of the
energy of a successful business leader—consists in the uncertainties
surrounding every decision. A very important class of these consists in turn
in the uncertainties about the reaction of one’s actual and potential
competitors and about how general business situations are going to shape.

Although other classes of uncertainties would no doubt persist in a socialist
commonwealth, these two can reasonably be expected to vanish almost
completely. The managements of socialized industries and plants would be
in a position to know exactly what the other fellows propose to do and
nothing would prevent them from getting together for concerted action.13 The
central board could, and to a certain extent would unavoidably, act as a
clearing house of information and as a coordinator of decisions—at least as
much as an all-embracing cartel bureau would. This would immensely reduce
the amount of work to be done in the workshops of managerial brains and
much less intelligence would be necessary to run such a system than is
required to steer a concern of any importance through the waves and
breakers of the capitalist sea. This suffices to establish our proposition.

<!-- 13 So far as this is being done in capitalist economies, it is a most important step toward
socialism. In fact, it progressively reduces the difficulties of transition and is in itself a symptom
of the advent of the transitional stage. To fight this tendency unconditionally is tantamount to
fighting socialism. -->
