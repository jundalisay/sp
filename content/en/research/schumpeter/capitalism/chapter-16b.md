3. To facilitate matters we will assume that means of production are present in given and, for the moment, unalterable quantities. 

Now let the central board resolve itself into a committee on a particular industry or, still better, let us set up an authority for each industry that is to manage it and to cooperate with the central board which controls and coordinates all these industrial managers or managing boards. This the central board does by allocating productive resources—all of which are under its control—to these industrial managements according to certain rules.

Suppose the board rules that industrial managements can have any quantities of producers’ goods and services they choose to call for subject to three conditions. First, they must produce as economically as possible. Second, they are required to transfer to the central board, for every unit of each producer’s good and service called for, a stated number of those consumers’ dollars which they have acquired by previous deliveries of consumers’ goods—we might just as well say that the central board declares itself ready to “sell” to any industrial management unlimited quantities of producers’ goods and services at stated “prices.”

<!-- 3 If modern theorists should object to this turn of phrase, let me entreat them to consider
the amount of entirely unnecessary circumlocution that more correct phrasing would involve
without offering, for the purposes of this argument, any compensatory advantage.
4 This is not to say that it would not fulfill requirements from the standpoint of another
definition of rationality. No assertion is being made here about how the arrangement under
discussion compares with others. Something will be said about this presently. -->

Third, the managements are required to call for and to use such quantities as (and not less than), producing in the most economical manner, they can use without having to “sell” any part of their products for less “dollars” than they have to transfer to the central board for the corresponding amounts of means of production. In more technical language, this condition means that production in all lines should be such as to make “prices” equal (not merely proportional) to marginal costs. 5

<!-- 5 This principle, which follows from the general logic of choice, was not universally
accepted until Mr. A.P.Lerner stressed it and fought for it in a number of notes and papers,
mostly in the Review of Economic Studies (also in the Economic Journal, September 1937),
which constitute an important contribution to the theory of the socialist economy and to
which I take this opportunity of drawing the reader’s attention. It is also correct, as a
proposition of that logic of choice, to say that the above condition should prevail over the
rule of equating prices to total cost per unit whenever it conflicts with it. But the relation
between them has been somewhat obscured by a confusion of different things, and calls
for some clarification. -->


The concept of marginal cost, meaning the increment of total cost that must be incurred
if production is to be increased by a small amount, is indeterminate as long as we do not
relate it to a definite period of time. Thus, if the question is whether or not to transport an
additional passenger by a train that would run in any case, marginal cost to be considered
might be zero and at all events is very small. This may be expressed by saying that, from
the standpoint of a very short period—an hour or a day, or even a week—practically
everything is overhead, even lubricants and coal, and that overhead does not enter into
marginal cost. But the longer the period envisaged the more cost elements enter marginal
cost, first all that are usually comprised in the concept of prime cost and after them more
and more of what the businessman calls overhead, until, for the very long run or from the
standpoint of planning an as yet non-existent industrial unit, nothing (or practically nothing)
is left in the category of overhead and everything including depreciation has to be taken
into account in figuring out marginal cost, so far as this principle is not modified, in the
case of some factors such as a railroad track, by the technological fact that they are
available or usable only in very big units (“indivisibility”). Marginal costs should hence
always be distinguished from (marginal) prime costs.

Now we often associate the condition under discussion with the rule that the socialist—
just like the capitalist—managements should, at any point of time, let bygones be bygones
if they are to act rationally; that is to say that in their decisions they are not to take account
of the book values of existing investments. But this is only a rule for short-run behavior
in a given situation. It does not mean that they are to neglect ex ante those elements that
will crystallize into fixed costs or overhead. To neglect these would spell irrational behavior
with respect to the labor hours and units of natural resources that go into the production
of the overhead, whenever there is an alternative use for them. But to take account of them
will in general imply equating prices to total cost per unit of product as long as things
develop according to plans, and since exceptions are mainly due to the technological
obstacle to rationality represented by indivisibility or to deviations of the actual course of
events from the plans, the logic of these plans is after all not badly expressed by the latter
principle. Though in a short-run situation it may be the most rational thing to do, it is yet
never part of that logic to operate an industry at a deficit. This is important to note for
two reasons.

First, it has been denied. It has even been suggested that welfare would (i.e., in the
long run) be increased if prices were always equated to short-run marginal costs
excluding depreciation and that overhead (say, the cost of a bridge) should be financed

The task of each industrial board is then uniquely determined. Exactly
as today every firm in a perfectly competitive industry knows what and
how much to produce and how to produce it as soon as technical
possibilities, reactions of consumers (their tastes and incomes) and prices
of means of production are given, so the industrial managements in our
socialist commonwealth would know what to produce, how to produce and
what factor quantities to “buy” from the central board as soon as the
latter’s “prices” are published and as soon as the consumers have revealed
their “demands.”

In a sense these “prices,” unlike the “prices” of consumers’ goods, are
unilaterally set by the central board. We may also say however that industrial
managers display a uniquely determined “demand” for the producers’ goods
much as consumers do for consumers’ goods. All we still need to complete
our proof is a rule, conforming to the maximum criterion, for that price-
fixing activity of the central board. But this rule is obvious. The board has
simply to set a single price on every kind and quality of producers’ goods—
if the board dis criminates, i.e., charges different prices for the same kind
and quality to different managements, this would in general 6 have to be
justified on non-economic grounds—and to see to it that that price exactly
“clears the market,” i.e., that no unused quantities of producers’ goods
remain on its hands and that no additional quantities are called at those
“prices.” This rule will normally suffice to insure rational cost accounting,
hence economically rational allocation of productive resources—for the
former is nothing but a method of insuring and verifying the latter—hence
rationality of the plan of production in socialist societies. Proof follows from
the consideration that as long as this rule is being observed no element of
productive resources can be diverted to any other line of production without
causing the destruction of as much (or more) consumers’ values, expressed
by taxation. Our rule, as given in the text, does not mean this, and it would not be a
rational thing to do.

Second, in a decree of March 1936 the Russian central authority, abolishing for a
number of industries the system of subsidies till then in force, prescribed that prices
should be regulated so as to equate average total cost per unit plus an addition for
accumulation. For the first part of the rule it may be said that, though not strictly correct,
it differs less from the correct one than incorrect formulations of the latter might lead
one to suppose; for the latter, that the obvious objection to it is much weakened as soon
as we take into account the conditions or necessities of rapid development—the reader
will recall the argument submitted in Part II for the capitalist case—and that it is quite
conceivable that the Soviet government was right both in embarking upon its policy of
subsidies, which amounted to financing investment at a loss, and in partly abolishing the
practice in 1936.

<!-- 6 There are exceptions to this which are of importance but do not affect the drift
of our argument. -->

in terms of consumers’ dollars, as that element would add in its new
employment. This amounts to saying that production is being carried, in all
directions open in the general conditions of the society’s environment, as far
as and no farther than it rationally can be and completes our case for the
rationality of socialist planning in a stationary process of economic life in
which everything is correctly foreseen and repeats itself and in which nothing
happens to upset the plan.
