1. According to Engels, Marx in 1847 adopted the term “communist” in
preference to the term “socialist,” because socialism had by that time
acquired a flavor of bourgeois respectability. However that may have been
and however we choose to explain this fact if it was a fact—more than once
we have seen good reason for interpreting socialism as a product of the
bourgeois mentality—there cannot be any doubt that Marx and Engels
themselves were typical bourgeois intellectuals. Exiles of bourgeois
extraction and tradition—this formula accounts for a lot both in Marx’s
thought and in the policies and political tactics he recommended. The
astounding thing is the extent to which his ideas prevailed.
First of all, the uprooted intellectual, with the formative experience of
1848 forever impressed upon his whole soul, cast off his own class and was
cast off by it. Similarly uprooted intellectuals and, at one remove, the
proletarian masses were henceforth all that was accessible to him and all he
had to put his trust in. This explains the doctrine which, as we have seen in
the preceding chapter, does stand in need of explanation, viz., that workers
would “emancipate themselves.”

2. The same uprooted intellectual naturally became internationalist in feeling. This meant more than that the problems and vicissitudes of any
particular country—even of individual national proletariats—did not primarily
concern him and always remained on the periphery of his interests. It meant
that it was so much easier for him to create the hypernational socialist religion
and to conceive of an international proletariat the component parts of which
were, in principle at least, much more closely wedded to each other than each
of them was to its own co-nationals of a different class. Anyone could in cold
logic have framed this obviously unrealistic conception and all that it implies
for the interpretation of past history and for the views of Marxist parties on
foreign policy. But then it would have had to contend with all the affective
influences exerted by the national environments and could never have been
passionately embraced by a man tied to a country by innumerable bonds. No
such bonds existed for Marx. Having no country himself he readily convinced
himself that the proletariat had none.

We shall presently see why—and how far—this teaching survived and
what, under varying circumstances, it was made to mean. Marx accepted its non-interventionist and pacifist implications. He certainly
thought not only that “capitalist wars” were of no concern to the proletariat
but also that they were the means of subjugating it still more completely. The
concession he may be held to have made, i.e., that participation in the
defense of one’s own country against attack is not incompatible with the
duties of the faithful, obviously was no more than a very necessary tactical
device.

3. Whatever his doctrine may have been,1 the uprooted bourgeois had
democracy in his blood. That is to say, belief in that part of the bourgeois
scheme of values which centers in democracy was for him not alone a matter
of the rational perception of the conditions peculiar to the social pattern of his
or any other time. Nor was it merely a matter of tactics. It is true that socialist
activities (and his personal work) could not have been carried on, not with any
comfort at all events, in any environment professing other than democratic
principles as then understood. Save in very exceptional cases, every opposition
must stand for freedom—which for him meant democracy—and throw itself
on the mercy of “the people.” Of course this element was and in some
countries is even now very important. This is precisely, as I have pointed out,
why democratic professions by socialist parties do not mean much until their
political power becomes great enough to give them a choice of an alternative,
and why they do not, in particular, avail to establish any fundamental relation
between the logic of socialism and the logic of democracy. But it nevertheless
seems safe to say that for Marx democracy was above discussion and any other
political pattern below it. This much must be granted to the revolutionary of
the 1848 type. 2 Of course it was out of the question for him to accept so
important an article of the bourgeois faith as it stood. That would have
uncovered a most inconveniently large expanse of common ground. But we
have seen in the preceding part that he knew how to meet this difficulty by
boldly claiming that only socialist democracy was true democracy and that
bourgeois democracy was no democracy at all.

2. Such then was Marx’s political apriori. 3 

No need to emphasize that it was totally different from the aprioris of the average English socialist not
only of his own but of any time—so different as to render mutual sympathy
and even full mutual understanding almost impossible, quite irrespective of
Hegelianism and other doctrinal barriers. The same difference will stand out

<!-- 1 See ch. xx and xxiii.
2 The emotional attitude acquired in 1848 also made it quite impossible for him to
understand, let alone to do justice to, the non-democratic regime that exiled him. Dispassionate
analysis could not have failed to reveal its achievements and possibilities. But such analysis
was in this case quite beyond his range.
3 No language that I know officially admits this word as a noun. To make it one is however
a very convenient solecism. -->

still better if we compare Marx to another German intellectual of very similar
background, Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864). The scion of the same race,
the product of the same stratum, molded by a closely similar cultural
tradition, similarly conditioned by the experiences of 1848 and by the
ideology of bourgeois democracy, Lassalle yet differs from Marx in a manner
that cannot be explained wholly by the personal equation. Much more vital
than this was the fact that Marx was an exile and Lassalle was not. Lassalle
never cut himself off from his country or from classes other than the
proletariat. He never was an internationalist like Marx. By proletariat he
meant primarily the German proletariat. He had no objection to cooperation
with the state that was. He did not object to personal contact with Bismarck
or with the king of Bavaria. Such things are important, more important
perhaps than the most profound doctrinal differences, important enough to
produce different kinds of socialism and irreconcilable antagonisms.
Let us now take our stand on Marx’s apriori and survey the political data
that confronted him.

At first, the huge industrial masses of which Marx wrote and thought
existed nowhere except in England. Even there, the chartist movement having
petered out by the time he had found his bearings, the working class was
becoming increasingly realistic and conservative. Disappointed by the failure
of earlier radical activities, the men were turning away from flashy programs
and from songs about their right to the total product. They soberly embarked
upon an attempt to increase their share in it. The leaders were cautiously
trying to establish, to buttress and to increase the legal status and the
economic power of the trade unions within the political framework of
bourgeois society. On principle as well as for obvious tactical considerations,
they were bound to look upon revolutionary ideas or activities as a nuisance
and as a stupid or frivolous sabotage of labor’s serious business. Also, they
concerned themselves with the upper stratum of the working class; for the
lower, they harbored feelings that were akin to contempt.
