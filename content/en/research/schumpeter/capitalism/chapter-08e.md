5. What is a monopoly?

<!-- I have entitled this chapter as I did because most of it deals with the
facts and problems that common parlance associates with monopoly or
monopolistic practice. So far I have as much as possible refrained from using
those terms in order to reserve for a separate section some comments on a
few topics specifically connected with them. Nothing will be said however
that we have not already met in one form or another. -->

(a) Monopolist means Single Seller.*

{{< n n="In the original definition of Adam Smith, monopolist is both single buyer and seller since the colonial governments in Asia had total control of the colonized economies" >}}


<!-- 15 There are many other elements. The reader will please understand that in
dealing with a few questions of principles it is impossible to do full justice to any of the
topics touched upon.

Literally therefore anyone is a monopolist who sells anything that is not in
every respect, wrapping and location and service included, exactly like what
other people sell: every grocer, or every haberdasher, or every seller of
“Good Humors” on a road that is not simply lined with sellers of the same
brand of ice cream. This however is not what we mean when talking about
monopolists. 

We mean only those single sellers whose markets are not open
to the intrusion of would-be producers of the same commodity and of actual
producers of similar ones or, speaking slightly more technically, only those
single sellers who face a given demand schedule that is severely independent
of their own action as well as of any reactions to their action by other
concerns. The traditional Cournot-Marshall theory of monopoly as extended
and amended by later authors holds only if we define it in this way and there
is, so it seems, no point in calling anything a monopoly to which that theory
does not apply.

But if accordingly we do define it like this, then it becomes evident
immediately that pure cases of long-run monopoly must be of the rarest
occurrence and that even tolerable approximations to the requirements of
the concept must be still rarer than are cases of perfect competition. The
power to exploit at pleasure a given pattern of demand—or one that
changes independently of the monopolist’s action and of the reactions it
provokes—can under the conditions of intact capitalism hardly persist for
a period long enough to matter for the analysis of total output, unless
buttressed by public authority, for instance, in the case of fiscal
monopolies. A modern business concern not so protected—i.e., even if
protected by import duties or import prohibitions—and yet wielding that
power (except temporarily) is not easy to find or even to imagine. Even
railroads and power and light concerns had first to create the demand for
their services and, when they had done so, to defend their market against
competition. Outside the field of public utilities, the position of a single
seller can in general be conquered—and retained for decades—only on the
condition that he does not behave like a monopolist. Short-run monopoly
will be touched upon presently.

Why then all this talk about monopoly? The answer is not without interest
for the student of the psychology of political discussion. Of course, the
concept of monopoly is being loosely used just like any other. 

People speak
of a country’s having a monopoly of something or other 16 even if the

16 These so-called monopolies have of late come to the fore in connection with the proposal
to withhold certain materials from aggressor nations. The lessons of this discussion have some
bearing upon our problem by way of analogy. At first, much was thought of the possibilities of
that weapon. Then, on looking more closely at it, people found their lists of such materials to
be shrinking, because it became increasingly clear that there are very few things that cannot
he either produced or substituted for in the areas in question. And finally a suspicion began to industry in question is highly competitive and so on. But this is not all.
Economists, government agents, journalists and politicians in this country
obviously love the word because it has come to be a term of opprobrium
which is sure to rouse the public’s hostility against any interest so labeled.
In the Anglo-American world monopoly has been cursed and associated with
functionless exploitation ever since, in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, it was English administrative practice to create monopoly positions
in large numbers which, on the one hand, answered fairly well to the
theoretical pattern of monopolist behavior and, on the other hand, fully
justified the wave of indignation that impressed even the great Elizabeth.
Nothing is so retentive as a nation’s memory. Our time offers other and
more important instances of a nation’s reaction to what happened centuries
ago. That practice made the English-speaking public so monopoly-conscious
that it acquired a habit of attributing to that sinister power practically
everything it disliked about business. To the typical liberal bourgeois in
particular, monopoly became the father of almost all abuses—in fact, it
became his pet bogey. Adam Smith, 17 thinking primarily of monopolies of
the Tudor and Stuart type, frowned on them in awful dignity. Sir Robert
Peel—who like most conservatives occasionally knew how to borrow from
the arsenal of the demagogue—in his famous epilogue to his last period of
office that gave so much offense to his associates, spoke of a monopoly of
bread or wheat, though English grain production was of course perfectly
competitive in spite of protection. 18 And in this country monopoly is being
made practically synonymous with any large-scale business.
