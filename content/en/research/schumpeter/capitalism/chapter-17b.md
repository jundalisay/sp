2. This definition does not identify economic efficiency with economic welfare or with given
degrees of satisfaction of wants. 

Even if any conceivable socialist
economy were sure to be in our sense less efficient than any conceivable
commercial economy, the majority of people—all in fact for whom the
typical socialist cares—might still be “better off” or “happier” or “more
content” in the former than in the latter. My first and main reply is that
relative efficiency retains independent meaning even in such cases and
that in all cases it will be an important consideration. But secondly I do
not think that we lose much by adopting a criterion that neglects those
aspects. This however is a very debatable matter on which it is just as
well to be a little more explicit.

To begin with, convinced socialists will derive satisfaction from the mere fact of living in a socialist society. 4 Socialist bread may well taste sweeter to them than capitalist bread simply because it is socialist bread, and it would
do so even if they found mice in it. If, moreover, the particular socialist
system adopted happens to agree with one’s moral principles as for instance
equalitarian socialism would with the moral principles of many socialists,
this fact and the consequent gratification of one’s sense of justice will of
course be listed among that system’s titles to superiority. 


<!-- 3 Since the capitalist and the socialist streams of real income will to some extent consist
of different commodities and contain the commodities common to both in somewhat different
proportions—though in the absence of additional hypotheses about the change in the distribution
of spendable incomes it is impossible to estimate the importance of the difference—comparison
raises delicate questions of theory. If more wine and less bread are produced in the capitalist
than would be produced in the socialist society, which of the streams is the larger? In any
attempt to answer such a question, the difficulties incident to comparing income streams in the
same social framework from one year to the next (to constructing any index of total output,
that is) are met on a greatly magnified scale. For our purpose, however, the following definition
sufficiently meets the theoretical problem: one of the streams shall be called larger than the
other if, and only if, it yields a greater monetary total than the other, whichever of the two price
systems is used in the evaluation of both. If one stream yields a higher figure when both are
evaluated by means of say, the capitalist price system, and at the same time a smaller figure
when both are evaluated at the socialist price system, then we call them equal just as if they
actually yielded equal totals with both price systems—which simply means that we trust that
the difference will in general not be very significant in that case. The statistical problem is of
course not solved by this definition, because we cannot have the two streams before us at the
same time. -->

<!-- 4 We are in fact sometimes invited to overlook admitted shortcomings of the socialist plan
for the sake of the privilege of becoming members of a socialist society. This argument, frankly
formulating as it does the truly socialist feeling, is by no means as unreasonable as it may
sound. It really renders all other arguments superfluous. -->




For the working
of the system such moral allegiance is by no means indifferent; its
importance even for efficiency in our sense will have to be noticed later. But
beyond that all of us had better admit that our phraseology about justice and
so on reduces largely to whether we like a certain form of society or not.
There seems however to be a purely economic argument in favor of
equalitarian socialism or any socialism the structure of which admits of
greater equality of incomes. Those economists at least who feel no
compunction about treating satisfactions of wants as measurable quantities
and about comparing and adding the satisfactions of different persons have
a right to argue that a given stock or stream of consumers’ goods will in
general produce the maximum of satisfaction if equally distributed. 

An
equalitarian system as efficient as its commercial counterpart will hence
run at a higher level of welfare. Even a somewhat less efficient equalitarian
system might do so. Most modern theorists would discard this argument
on the grounds, that satisfactions are not measurable or that comparison
and addition of the satisfactions of different people are meaningless. We
need not go so far. It is sufficient to point out that the equalitarian argument
is particularly open to the objection raised in our analysis of monopolistic
practice: the problem is not how to distribute a quantity given
independently of the principles of income distribution. 

Wage incomes
might well be higher in a commercial society admitting unrestricted
inequalities than the equal incomes would be in equalitarian socialism. So
long as it is not made reasonably certain that the socialist engine of
production would be at least nearly as efficient as the commercial engine
is or was or can be expected to be at the time of the comparison, the
argument about distribution remains inconclusive—question-begging in
fact—even if we choose to accept it. 5 And as soon as the question of
productive efficiency is settled the distributive argument will in most cases
be superfluous; unless it be based exclusively on moral ideals, it will turn
the balance only in borderline cases.

<!-- 5 The argument we thus discard may be made to read that other things being equal the
socialist maximum is greater than the competitive maximum. Owing to the purely formal nature
of both maxima however there is no point in comparing them, as should be obvious from
previous considerations. -->


3. There is still another reason why similar levels of productive efficiency
might be associated with different levels of welfare. Most socialists will hold
that a given national income would go further in socialist than it goes in
capitalist society because the former would make a more economical use of
it. These economies follow from the fact that certain types of society may,
by virtue of their organization, be indifferent or adverse to purposes to which
other types, also by virtue of their organization, allocate considerable parts
of their resources. A pacifist socialism for instance would economize on
armaments, an atheist one on churches, and both might therefore have more
hospitals instead. 

This is so, of course. But since it involves valuations which
cannot with confidence be attributed to socialism in general—though they
could be to many individual socialists—it does not concern us here.
Almost any socialist society—not the Platonic type though—would surely
realize another type of economy, viz., the economy from the elimination of
the leisure class, the “idle rich.” Since from the socialist standpoint it is quite
proper to neglect the satisfactions accruing to the individuals belonging to
this group and to evaluate its cultural functions at zero—though civilized
socialists always save their faces by adding: in the world of today—there is
obviously a net gain to be made by the socialist regime. How much do we
lose by using an efficiency test which neglects this?

Of course, modern taxation of incomes and inheritance is rapidly reducing
the problem to quantitative insignificance, even independently of the fiscal
methods applied in financing the current war. But this taxation itself is the
expression of an anti-capitalist attitude and possibly the forerunner of complete
elimination of the typically capitalist income brackets. We must therefore put
our question for a capitalist society not yet attacked at its economic roots. For
this country, it seems reasonable to select the data of 1929. 6
Let us define rich people as those who have incomes of $50,000 and over.

In 1929, they received about 13 billion dollars out of a national total of about
93 billions.7 From these 13 billions we have to deduct taxes, savings, and gifts
for public purposes, because the elimination of these items would not constitute
economies for the socialist regime; it is only the expenditure of rich people for
their own consumption that would be “saved” in the proper sense of the word.8

<!-- 6 The United States is the country that qualifies best for this test, In most European countries
the problem would be complicated, at least for the nineteenth century or even until 1914, by
the presence of high incomes which were of precapitalist origin but had been swelled by
capitalist evolution.
7 See H.G.Moulton, M.Levin, and C.A.Warburton, America’s Capacity to Consume
(1934), p. 206. These figures are admittedly extremely rough. They include incomes
from occupations and investments, also from sales of property and imputed returns from
owned homes.
8 It will be seen that the fact that the socialist authority would presumably use those savings
and gifts for different purposes does not affect the argument. -->

This expenditure cannot be estimated with any accuracy. All we can hope
for is an idea about the orders of magnitude involved. Since most economists
who have been willing to take the risk guessed at less than one-third of the
13 billions, it will be fairly safe to say that this expenditure did not amount
to more than 4? billions or to about 4.6 per cent of the total national income.
Now this 4.6 per cent includes all of the consumers’ expenditure from the
higher business and professional incomes, so that the idle rich cannot have
absorbed more than 1 or a per cent at the outside. And, so far as the family
motive is still alive, not even all of that can be considered irrelevant to
performance conducive to the efficiency of the economic engine.

Some readers will no doubt feel that the $50,000 limit is unduly high. It
is clear of course that more could be economized by eliminating or reducing
to a subsistence level the incomes of all the people who are, economically
speaking, idle whether rich or poor. 9 Still more could be economized, so one
would think, by rationalizing the distribution of all higher incomes so as to
bring them into closer correspondence with performance. But arguments to
be submitted in the next section suggest that the high hopes entertained on
that score are likely to meet with disappointment.
I do not wish however to insist. For if the reader should attach greater
importance to these economies than I think justified, the conclusion we are
going to arrive at will apply only a fortiori.
