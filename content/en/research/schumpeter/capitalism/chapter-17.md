I. A PRELIMINARY POINT

THE reader who has followed so far will naturally expect me to embark
upon a comparative appraisal of the socialist plan. Perhaps it would be
wise to disappoint that expectation. For nobody who is not completely
lacking in a sense of responsibility can fail to see that comparison between
a system which we have lived with and a system which as yet is but a mental
image—no socialist will accept the Russian experience as a full-weight
realization—must be extremely hazardous. But we will take the risk, bearing
in mind all the time that beyond the realm of fact and argument over which
we are going to travel there is the realm of individual preferences,
convictions, evaluations into which we cannot enter. And we will improve
our chances of success by severely restricting our goal and frankly
recognizing difficulties and pitfalls.

In particular, we shall not compare the cultural worlds of commercial and
socialist society. What I have called the cultural indeterminateness of
socialism is in itself sufficient to bar the attempt. But we have also another
reason for refraining. Even if socialist civilization meant just one definite
pattern, comparative appraisal would still be a doubtful matter. There are
idealists and monomaniacs who can see no difficulty in it and gaily adopt
for a standard of comparison some feature which they value to the exclusion
of everything else and which they expect their socialism to display. But if
we resolved to do better than that and, so far as our vision may reach, to
see all the facets of a civilization in the light that is born and dies with it,
we should instantly discover that every civilization is a world unto itself, and
incommensurable with every other.

There is one point however that bears upon comparison of actual and
possible cultural achievement and yet comes within the scope of our type
of analysis. It is often claimed that the socialist plan, by removing economic
care from the shoulders of the individual, will release incalculable cultural
energies that now go to waste in the struggle for daily bread. To some extent
this is true—any “planned” society may do that as, for other reasons and in
other respects, it also may smother cultural possibilities. It might be objected
that public authorities as we know them are hardly up to the responsibility of discovering and nursing talent to the stage of fruition, and that there is no sound reason to believe that they would have appreciated Van Gogh any
sooner than capitalist society did. But this objection misses the point. For
public authority need not go as far as this. All that is necessary is that Van
Gogh gets his “income” as everyone else does and that he is not worked too
hard; this would suffice in any normal case—though, when I come to think
of it, I am no longer sure whether it would have sufficed in the case of Van
Gogh—to give the necessary opportunity for the assertion of creative ability.
But another objection carries more weight. In this matter as in others the
advocate of socialism is likely to overlook—often he is passionately resolved
not to admit—the degree to which certain ideals of his are satisfied in the
modern world. Capitalism provides, to a much greater extent than most of
us believe, the ladders for talent to climb. There is an element of truth in
the brutal slogan of the typical bourgeois which many worthy men find so
irritating, viz., that those who cannot climb by these ladders are not worth
troubling about. 

The ladders may not be up to any standard we choose to
set, but it cannot be said that they do not exist. Not only does modern
capitalism systematically proffer means to shelter and nurse almost any kind
of ability in the early stages of its development—so much so that in some
lines the difficulty is not how to find the means for talent but how to find
anything that has any claim to be called a talent for the means proffered—
but by the very law of its structure it tends to send up the able individual
and, much more effectively, the able family. Thus, though there may be
social losses 1 particularly in the class of semi-pathological genius, it is not
likely that they are very great.


II. A DISCUSSION OF COMPARATIVE EFFICIENCY


Let us stay however within the economic sphere though I hope I have made
it quite clear that I do not attribute to it more than secondary importance.
1. The restrictions of our scope are most obvious and hence the pitfalls
least dangerous at the first step which is still concerned with nothing but
blueprints. Again deferring discussion of transitional difficulties, to be dealt
with separately, and provisionally assuming that they have been successfully
overcome, we need only glance at the implications of our proof of the
possibility and practicability of the socialist schema in order to realize that
there is a strong case for believing in its superior economic efficiency.


<!-- 1 Instances overstate by inference, even if they do not vanish on investigation as they often
do. Moreover, some of those losses occur independently of the particular organization of society;
not every such loss in the capitalist arrangement is also a loss through the capitalist
arrangement. -->


That superiority need be proved only with respect to big-business or “monopolistic” capitalism because superiority over “competitive”
capitalism then follows a fortiori. This is evident from our analysis in
Chapter VIII. Many economists, on the strength of the fact that under
completely unrealistic conditions all sorts of flattering propositions can
be established about competitive capitalism, have acquired a habit of
extolling it at the expense of its “monopolistic” successor. 

I wish to
repeat therefore that even if those eulogies were entirely justified—which
they are not—and if the theorist’s perfect competition had ever been
realized in the field of industry and transportation—which it never was—
finally, if all the accusations ever leveled against big business were
entirely justified—which is far from being the case—it would still be a
fact that the actual efficiency of the capitalist engine of production in the
era of the largest-scale units has been much greater than in the preceding
era of small or mediumsized ones. This is a matter of statistical record.
But if we recall the theoretical explanation of that fact, we further realize
that the increasing size of units of control and all the business strategy
that went with it were not only unavoidable incidents but to a
considerable extent also conditions of the achievement reflected in that
record; in other words, that the technological and organizational
possibilities open to firms of the type which is compatible with
approximately perfect competition could never have produced similar
results. How modern capitalism would work under perfect competition is
hence a meaningless question. Therefore, quite apart from the fact that
socialism will inherit a “monopolistic” and not a competitive capitalism,
we need not trouble about the competitive case except incidentally.

Economic efficiency of a system we will reduce to productive efficiency.

Even the latter is by no means easy to define. The two alternatives to be
compared must of course 2 be referred to the same point of time—past,
present or future. But this is not enough. For the relevant question is not
what, ex visu of a given point of time, socialist management could do with
the capitalist apparatus existing at that point of time—this is for us not much
more interesting than what socialist management could do with a given stock
of consumers’ goods—but what productive apparatus would exist or would
have existed had a socialist instead of the capitalist management presided
over its construction. The mass of information about our actual and potential
productive resources that has been accumulated during the last twenty years,
however valuable it may be for other purposes, thus lends but little aid in
2 This rule should be self-evident, yet it is frequently violated, For instance, the economic
performance of Soviet Russia at the present time is often compared with that of the tsarist
regime at the threshold of the First World War. But the lapse of a quarter of a century has robbed
such a comparison of all significance. The only comparison that could possibly be significant
would be with the values on an extrapolated trend based upon the figures for, say, 1800–1914.
Can Socialism Survive?190
the struggle with our difficulty. And all we can do is to list such differences
between the mechanisms of the economic engines of socialist and of
commercial society as we may nevertheless perceive, and to appraise their
importance as best we can.
We will postulate that the number, quality, tastes and age distribution of
the population at the time of comparison be the same in both cases. Then
we shall call that system relatively more efficient which we see reason to
expect would in the long run produce the larger stream of consumers’ goods
per equal unit of time. 3
2. This definition requires comment. It will be seen that it does not
identify economic efficiency with economic welfare or with given
degrees of satisfaction of wants. Even if any conceivable socialist
economy were sure to be in our sense less efficient than any conceivable
commercial economy, the majority of people—all in fact for whom the
typical socialist cares—might still be “better off” or “happier” or “more
content” in the former than in the latter. My first and main reply is that
relative efficiency retains independent meaning even in such cases and
that in all cases it will be an important consideration. But secondly I do
not think that we lose much by adopting a criterion that neglects those
aspects. This however is a very debatable matter on which it is just as
well to be a little more explicit.
To begin with, convinced socialists will derive satisfaction from the mere

3 Since the capitalist and the socialist streams of real income will to some extent consist
of different commodities and contain the commodities common to both in somewhat different
proportions—though in the absence of additional hypotheses about the change in the distribution
of spendable incomes it is impossible to estimate the importance of the difference—comparison
raises delicate questions of theory. If more wine and less bread are produced in the capitalist
than would be produced in the socialist society, which of the streams is the larger? In any
attempt to answer such a question, the difficulties incident to comparing income streams in the
same social framework from one year to the next (to constructing any index of total output,
that is) are met on a greatly magnified scale. For our purpose, however, the following definition
sufficiently meets the theoretical problem: one of the streams shall be called larger than the
other if, and only if, it yields a greater monetary total than the other, whichever of the two price
systems is used in the evaluation of both. If one stream yields a higher figure when both are
evaluated by means of say, the capitalist price system, and at the same time a smaller figure
when both are evaluated at the socialist price system, then we call them equal just as if they
actually yielded equal totals with both price systems—which simply means that we trust that
the difference will in general not be very significant in that case. The statistical problem is of
course not solved by this definition, because we cannot have the two streams before us at the
same time.

The reason why the words in the long run have been inserted in the sentence of the text
should be obvious from our analysis in ch. vii.

4 We are in fact sometimes invited to overlook admitted shortcomings of the socialist plan
for the sake of the privilege of becoming members of a socialist society. This argument, frankly
formulating as it does the truly socialist feeling, is by no means as unreasonable as it may
sound. It really renders all other arguments superfluous.


fact of living in a socialist society. 4 Socialist bread may well taste sweeter
to them than capitalist bread simply because it is socialist bread, and it would
do so even if they found mice in it. If, moreover, the particular socialist
system adopted happens to agree with one’s moral principles as for instance
equalitarian socialism would with the moral principles of many socialists,
this fact and the consequent gratification of one’s sense of justice will of
course be listed among that system’s titles to superiority. 

For the working
of the system such moral allegiance is by no means indifferent; its
importance even for efficiency in our sense will have to be noticed later. But
beyond that all of us had better admit that our phraseology about justice and
so on reduces largely to whether we like a certain form of society or not.
There seems however to be a purely economic argument in favor of
equalitarian socialism or any socialism the structure of which admits of
greater equality of incomes. Those economists at least who feel no
compunction about treating satisfactions of wants as measurable quantities
and about comparing and adding the satisfactions of different persons have
a right to argue that a given stock or stream of consumers’ goods will in
general produce the maximum of satisfaction if equally distributed. An
equalitarian system as efficient as its commercial counterpart will hence
run at a higher level of welfare. Even a somewhat less efficient equalitarian
system might do so. Most modern theorists would discard this argument
on the grounds, that satisfactions are not measurable or that comparison
and addition of the satisfactions of different people are meaningless. We
need not go so far. It is sufficient to point out that the equalitarian argument
is particularly open to the objection raised in our analysis of monopolistic
practice: the problem is not how to distribute a quantity given
independently of the principles of income distribution. Wage incomes
might well be higher in a commercial society admitting unrestricted
inequalities than the equal incomes would be in equalitarian socialism. So
long as it is not made reasonably certain that the socialist engine of
production would be at least nearly as efficient as the commercial engine
is or was or can be expected to be at the time of the comparison, the
argument about distribution remains inconclusive—question-begging in
fact—even if we choose to accept it. 5 And as soon as the question of
productive efficiency is settled the distributive argument will in most cases
be superfluous; unless it be based exclusively on moral ideals, it will turn
the balance only in borderline cases.

<!-- 5 The argument we thus discard may be made to read that other things being equal the
socialist maximum is greater than the competitive maximum. Owing to the purely formal nature
of both maxima however there is no point in comparing them, as should be obvious from
previous considerations. -->


3. There is still another reason why similar levels of productive efficiency
might be associated with different levels of welfare. Most socialists will hold
that a given national income would go further in socialist than it goes in
capitalist society because the former would make a more economical use of
it. These economies follow from the fact that certain types of society may,
by virtue of their organization, be indifferent or adverse to purposes to which
other types, also by virtue of their organization, allocate considerable parts
of their resources. A pacifist socialism for instance would economize on
armaments, an atheist one on churches, and both might therefore have more
hospitals instead. This is so, of course. But since it involves valuations which
cannot with confidence be attributed to socialism in general—though they
could be to many individual socialists—it does not concern us here.
Almost any socialist society—not the Platonic type though—would surely
realize another type of economy, viz., the economy from the elimination of
the leisure class, the “idle rich.” Since from the socialist standpoint it is quite
proper to neglect the satisfactions accruing to the individuals belonging to
this group and to evaluate its cultural functions at zero—though civilized
socialists always save their faces by adding: in the world of today—there is
obviously a net gain to be made by the socialist regime. How much do we
lose by using an efficiency test which neglects this?
Of course, modern taxation of incomes and inheritance is rapidly reducing
the problem to quantitative insignificance, even independently of the fiscal
methods applied in financing the current war. But this taxation itself is the
expression of an anti-capitalist attitude and possibly the forerunner of complete
elimination of the typically capitalist income brackets. We must therefore put
our question for a capitalist society not yet attacked at its economic roots. For
this country, it seems reasonable to select the data of 1929. 6
Let us define rich people as those who have incomes of $50,000 and over.
In 1929, they received about 13 billion dollars out of a national total of about
93 billions.7 From these 13 billions we have to deduct taxes, savings, and gifts
for public purposes, because the elimination of these items would not constitute
economies for the socialist regime; it is only the expenditure of rich people for
their own consumption that would be “saved” in the proper sense of the word.8
6 The United States is the country that qualifies best for this test, In most European countries
the problem would be complicated, at least for the nineteenth century or even until 1914, by
the presence of high incomes which were of precapitalist origin but had been swelled by
capitalist evolution.
7 See H.G.Moulton, M.Levin, and C.A.Warburton, America’s Capacity to Consume
(1934), p. 206. These figures are admittedly extremely rough. They include incomes
from occupations and investments, also from sales of property and imputed returns from
owned homes.
8 It will be seen that the fact that the socialist authority would presumably use those savings
and gifts for different purposes does not affect the argument.
Comparison of Blueprints 193
This expenditure cannot be estimated with any accuracy. All we can hope
for is an idea about the orders of magnitude involved. Since most economists
who have been willing to take the risk guessed at less than one-third of the
13 billions, it will be fairly safe to say that this expenditure did not amount
to more than 4? billions or to about 4.6 per cent of the total national income.
Now this 4.6 per cent includes all of the consumers’ expenditure from the
higher business and professional incomes, so that the idle rich cannot have
absorbed more than 1 or a per cent at the outside. And, so far as the family
motive is still alive, not even all of that can be considered irrelevant to
performance conducive to the efficiency of the economic engine.
Some readers will no doubt feel that the $50,000 limit is unduly high. It
is clear of course that more could be economized by eliminating or reducing
to a subsistence level the incomes of all the people who are, economically
speaking, idle whether rich or poor. 9 Still more could be economized, so one
would think, by rationalizing the distribution of all higher incomes so as to
bring them into closer correspondence with performance. But arguments to
be submitted in the next section suggest that the high hopes entertained on
that score are likely to meet with disappointment.
I do not wish however to insist. For if the reader should attach greater
importance to these economies than I think justified, the conclusion we are
going to arrive at will apply only a fortiori.
III. T HE C ASE F OR T HE S UPERIORITY O F T HE S OCIALIST B LUEPRINT
Thus our criterion of superiority or inferiority after all covers more ground
than it seems to. But if we stand by it, what is that strong case for the
superiority of the socialist blueprint of which I spoke before?
The reader who has perused the analysis in Chapter VIII may well wonder.
Most of the arguments usually advanced in support of the socialist and against
the capitalist regi2me, as we have seen, fail as soon as proper account is taken
of the conditions created for business by a rapid rate of progress. Some of
those arguments, on closer inspection, even turn out to cut the other way. Much
of what is being considered pathological is seen to be physiological—to fulfill
important functions in the process of creative destruction. Many wastes carry
9 It should however be noted that an income consisting exclusively of returns on investments
is no indication of the economic idleness of its receiver, because his work may be embodied
in his investments. The classroom illustration of this will serve as well as a longer argument
could: suppose a man reclaims a piece of land by the work of his hands; the return he will
thereafter receive is a “return on an appliance made by man” or, as economists call it, a quasi-
rent. If the improvement is permanent, it will become undistinguishable from the rent of land
proper and hence look like the very incarnation of unearned income whereas in reality it is a
form of wages if we define wages as returns attributable to personal productive exertions.
Generalizing, we may say that effort may be undergone in order to secure revenues which may,
but need not, take the form of wages.


compensations that sometimes completely, in other cases partly, invalidate the
inference. Socially irrational allocation of resources is not nearly as frequent
or important as it is made out to be. In some cases, moreover, it is no less likely
to occur in a socialist economy. Excess capacity, also partly inevitable in a
socialist economy, will often bear an interpretation which rebuts criticism. And
even unrelieved blemishes are after all but incidents of an achievement that is
great enough to cover a multitude of sins.
The answer so our question follows from the last paragraph of the preceding
chapter. It might be of doubtful validity as long as capitalist evolution is in
full swing but it will be decisive as soon as it permanently slackens down,
whether from reasons inherent in or external to its economic mechanism.
There are cases in which capitalist industries are so circumstanced that
prices and output become theoretically indeterminate. They may occur,
though they do not always occur, whenever there is oligopoly. In a socialist
economy everything—limiting cases without practical importance alone
excepted—is uniquely determined. But even when there exists a theoretically
determined state it is much more difficult and expensive to reach in the
capitalist economy than it would be in the socialist economy. In the former
endless moves and counter moves are necessary and decisions have to be
taken in an atmosphere of uncertainty that blunts the edge of action, whereas
that strategy and that uncertainty would be absent from the latter. That this
applies not only to “monopolistic” capitalism but, though for other reasons,
still more to the competitive species is shown by the hogcycle case 10 and by
the behavior of more or less perfectly competitive industries in general
depressions or in vicissitudes of their own.
But this means more than it seems to mean at first sight. Those
determinate solutions of the problems of production are rational or optimal
from the standpoint of given data, and anything that shortens, smoothens or
safeguards the road that leads to them is bound to save human energy and
material resources, and to reduce the costs at which a given result is attained.
Unless the resources thus saved are completely wasted, efficiency in our
sense must necessarily increase.
Under this heading some of the sweeping indictments of the capitalist
system which have been glanced at above acquire a qualified justification.
As an instance, take excess capacity. It is not true that it would be entirely
absent in socialism; it would be absurd for the central board to insist on full
utilization of a new railroad through as yet unsettled country. Nor is it true
that excess capacity spells loss in all cases. But there are types of excess
capacity which do spell loss and can be avoided by a socialist management,
10 See ch. viii.

Comparison of Blueprints 195

the chief case being that of reserve capacity for the purpose of economic
warfare. Whatever the importance of the particular case—I do not think it
is very considerable—it shows up a point to which I have already adverted:
there are things which within the conditions of capitalist evolution are, or
may be, perfectly rational and even necessary and therefore need not, ex visu
of the capitalist order, constitute blemishes at all; nor need they constitute
weaknesses of “monopolistic” as against competitive capitalism if they are
associated, as conditions, with achievements of the former that are out of the
reach of the latter; but even if that be so they may yet constitute weaknesses
as against the socialist blueprint.
This is particularly true of most of the phenomena that make up the
mechanism of trade cycles. Capitalist enterprise does not lack regulators,
some of which may well be met with again in the practice of the ministry
of production. But the planning of progress, in particular the systematic
coordination and orderly distribution in time of new ventures in all lines,
would be incomparably more effective in preventing bursts at some times and
depressive reactions at others than any automatic or manipulative variations
of the rate of interest or the supply of credit can be. In fact, it would
eliminate the cause of the cyclical ups and downs whereas in the capitalist
order it is only possible to mitigate them. And the process of discarding the
obsolete that in capitalism—especially in competitive capitalism—means
temporary paralysis and losses that are in part functionless, could be reduced
to what “discarding the obsolete” actually conveys to the layman’s mind
within a comprehensive plan providing in advance for the shifting to other
uses of the non-obsolete complements of the obsolete plants or pieces of
equipment. Concretely: a crisis centering in the cotton industry may in the
capitalist order put a stop to residential construction; in the socialist order it
may of course also happen that the production of cotton goods has to be
drastically curtailed at short notice, though it is not so likely to happen; but
this would be a reason to speed up residential construction instead of
stopping it.

Whatever the economic goals desired by whoever is in the position to
give effect to his desires, socialist management could attain them with less
disturbance and loss without necessarily incurring the disadvantages that
would attend attempts at planning progress within the framework of
capitalist institutions. One aspect of this might be expressed by saying that
the socialist management could steer a course approximating the long-run
trend of output, thus developing a tendency which as we have seen is not
foreign to big-business policy. And the whole of our argument might be
put in a nutshell by saying that socialization means a stride beyond big
business on the way that has been chalked out by it or, what amounts to the same thing, that socialist management may conceivably prove as
superior to big-business capitalism as big-business capitalism has proved
to be to the kind of competitive capitalism of which the English industry
of a hundred years ago was the prototype. It is quite possible that future
generations will look upon arguments about the inferiority of the socialist
plan as we look upon Adam Smith’s arguments about joint-stock
companies which, also, were not simply false.

Of course, all that I have said so far refers exclusively to the logic of
blueprints, hence to “objective” possibilities which socialism in practice may
be quite unable to realize. But as a matter of blueprint logic it is undeniable
that the socialist blueprint is drawn at a higher level of rationality. This, I
believe, is the correct way of putting the matter. It is not a case of rationality
versus irrationality. The farmer whose reaction to hog and fodder prices
produces the hog cycle is, individually and from the standpoint of the
moment, acting perfectly rationally. So is the management of a concern that
maneuvers in an oligopolistic situation. So is the firm that expands in the
boom and restricts in recession. It is the kind and scope of rationality that
makes the difference.
This is certainly not all that can be adduced on behalf of the socialist
plan. But so far as the pure logic of a socialist economy is concerned,
most arguments that are not provably wrong are in fact implied in the
one submitted.
An example of the first importance is afforded by unemployment. We
have seen in Part II that, as regards the interest of the unemployed
themselves, capitalist society in any stage sufficiently advanced to offer a
chance for successful socialization need and presumably will not leave very
much to be desired. But concerning the loss to society the preceding
argument implies that in a socialist society unemployment will be less,
mainly in consequence of the elimination of depressions, and that where it
does occur, mainly in consequence of technological improvement, the
ministry of production will be in a position—whatever it may actually do—
to redirect the men to other employments which, if the planning lives up to its possibilities at all, might in each case be waiting for them.
A minor advantage that is also implied in the superior rationality of the
socialist plan results from the fact that in the capitalist order improvements
occur as a rule in individual concerns and take time and meet resistance in
spreading. If the pace of progress is rapid, there is often a large number of
firms that cling to old methods or are otherwise of substandard efficiency.
In the socialist order every improvement could theoretically be spread by
decree and substandard practice could be promptly eliminated. 

I call this a
minor advantage because capitalism as a rule also deals pretty efficiently with the inefficient. Of course, the likelihood of this particular advantage,
whether great or small, being realized by a bureaucracy is another matter; a
decent bureaucracy may always be relied on to bring all its members up to
its standard, but this says nothing about what this standard itself will be. That
possible superiorities might in practice turn into actual inferiorities must be
kept in mind throughout.

Again, managers or owner-managers of small or medium-sized concerns
are as a rule primarily either engineers or salesmen or organizers and, even
if good men, rarely do all things equally well. We often find that even
successful businesses are indifferently managed in some respect or other—
witness the reports of efficiency experts—and their leaders are therefore
partially misplaced. The socialist economy could, as modern largest-scale
business does, use them to fuller advantage by using them exclusively in
what they really know how to do. But obvious considerations that need not
detain us will not allow us to entertain high hopes on that score.
There is however an advantage of prime importance that is not visible in
our blueprint as drawn. The outstanding feature of commercial society is the
division between the private and the public sphere—or, if you prefer, the fact
that in commercial society there is a private sphere which contains so much
more than either feudal or socialist society allocates to it. This private sphere
is distinct from the public sphere not only conceptually but also actually. The
two are to a great extent manned by different people—the history of local
self-government offering the most conspicuous exception—and organized as
well as run on different and often conflicting principles, productive of
different and often incompatible standards.
Friction can only temporarily be absent from such an arrangement the
paradoxical nature of which would be a source of wonder to us if we
were not so accustomed to it. As a matter of fact, friction was present
long before it developed into antagonism in consequence of the wars of
conquest waged upon the bourgeois domain with ever-increasing success
by the men of the public sphere. This antagonism entails struggle. Most
activities of the state in the economic field then appear in the light that
is well characterized by the old bourgeois economist’s phrase,
government interference. These activities do in fact interfere in every
sense of the word, especially in the sense that they hamper and paralyze
the private engine of production. It cannot be urged that they are
frequently successful, even in increasing productive efficiency. But as far
as they are, the central board’s activity would stand a still greater chance
of being so, whereas the costs and losses incident to the struggle as such
would be entirely avoided in the socialist case. And these losses are
considerable, especially if we count in all the worry caused by incessant
Can Socialism Survive?198
inquiries and prosecutions and the consequent discouraging effects on the
energies that propel business.
One element of these costs should be mentioned specifically. It consists
in the absorption of ability in merely protective activities. A considerable part
of the total work done by lawyers goes into the struggle of business with
the state and its organs. It is immaterial whether we call this vicious
obstruction of the common good or defense of the common good against
vicious obstruction. In any case the fact remains that in socialist society there
would be neither need nor room for this part of legal activity. The resulting
saving is not satisfactorily measured by the fees of the lawyers who are thus
engaged. That is inconsiderable. But not inconsiderable is the social loss
from such unproductive employment of many of the best brains. Considering
how terribly rare good brains are, their shifting to other employments might
be of more than infinitesimal importance.

The friction or antagonism between the private and the public sphere was
intensified from the first by the fact that, ever since the princes’ feudal
incomes ceased to be of major importance, the state has been living on a
revenue which was being produced in the private sphere for private purposes
and had to be deflected from these purposes by political force. 11 On the one
hand, taxation is an essential attribute of commercial society—or, if we
accept the conception of the state alluded to in the first chapter, of the state—
and, on the other hand, it is almost inevitably 12 in the nature of an injury to
the productive process. 

Until 1914 roughly—if we agree to consider modern
times only—that injury was confined within narrow bounds. But since then
taxes have grown, by degrees, into the dominant item of business and family
budgets and into a major factor in the explanation of unsatisfactory economic
performance. Moreover, in order to wrench ever-increasing amounts from an
unwilling organism, a huge administrative apparatus has come into existence
that does nothing but struggle with the bourgeoisie for every dollar of its
revenue. That organism has in response developed organs of defense and
does an immense amount of work in self-protection.

Nothing else brings out so well the wastes that result from the conflict
of structural principles in a social body. Modern capitalism relies on the
profit principle for its daily bread yet refuses to allow it to prevail. No such
conflict, consequently no such wastes, would exist in socialist society. 

Since it would control all sources of revenue, taxes could vanish with the state or, if my conception of the state does not command approval, with the bourgeois state. For, as a matter of common sense, it would be clearly absurd for the
central board to pay out incomes first and, after having done so, to run after
the recipients in order to recover part of them. If radicals were not so fond
of chivying the bourgeois that they cannot see anything wrong in taxes
except that they are too low, it would have been recognized before this that
here we have got hold of one of the most significant titles to superiority that
can be advanced in favor of the socialist plan.

<!-- 11 The theory which construes taxes on the analogy of club dues or of the purchase of the
services of, say, a doctor only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from
scientific habits of mind.

12 Exceptions exist, but they do not matter for practical purposes. -->
