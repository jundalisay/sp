4. Let us take the second stride. 

The Marshall-Wicksell analysis of
course did not overlook the many cases that fail to conform to that model.
Nor, for that matter, had the classics overlooked them. They recognized
cases of “monopoly,” and Adam Smith himself carefully noticed the
prevalence of devices to restrict competition 6 and all the differences in
flexibility of prices resulting therefrom. But they looked upon those cases
as exceptions and, moreover, as exceptions that could and would be done
away with in time. Something of that sort is true also of Marshall.
Although he developed the Cournot theory of monopoly 7 and although
he anticipated later analysis by calling attention to the fact that most
firms have special markets of their own in which they set prices instead
of merely accepting them, 8 he as well as Wicksell framed his general
conclusions on the pattern of perfect competition so as to suggest, much
as the classics did, that perfect competition was the rule. Neither Marshall
and Wicksell nor the classics saw that perfect competition is the
exception and that even if it were the rule there would be much less
reason for congratulation than one might think.



<!-- 6 In a manner strikingly suggestive of present-day attitudes he even emphasized the
discrepancy between the interests of every trade and those of the public and talked about
conspiracies against the latter which, so he thought, might originate at any businessmen’s
dinner party.

8 This is why the later theory of imperfect competition may fairly be traced to him. Though
he did not elaborate it, he saw the phenomenon more correctly than most of those who did. In
particular he did not exaggerate its importance. -->


If we look more closely at the conditions—not all of them explicitly
stated or even clearly seen by Marshall and Wicksell—that must be fulfilled in order to produce perfect competition, we realize immediately
that outside of agricultural mass production there cannot be many instances
of it. A farmer supplies his cotton or wheat in fact under those conditions:
from his standpoint the ruling prices of cotton or wheat are data, though
very variable ones, and not being able to influence them by his individual
action he simply adapts his output; since all farmers do the same, prices
and quantities will in the end be adjusted as the theory of perfect
competition requires. But this is not so even with many agricultural
products—with ducks, sausages, vegetables and many dairy products for
instance. And as regards practically all the finished products and services
of industry and trade, it is clear that every grocer, every filling station,
every manufacturer of gloves or shaving cream or handsaws has a small
and precarious market of his own which he tries—must try—to build up
and to keep by price strategy, quality strategy—“product differentiation”—
and advertising. Thus we get a completely different pattern which there
seems to be no reason to expect to yield the results of perfect competition
and which fits much better into the monopolistic schema. In these cases
we speak of Monopolistic Competition. Their theory has been one of the
major contributions to postwar economics. 9

There remains a wide field of substantially homogeneous products—
mainly industrial raw materials and semi-finished products such as steel
ingots, cement, cotton gray goods and the like—in which the conditions
for the emergence of monopolistic competition do not seem to prevail. This
is so. But in general, similar results follow for that field inasmuch as the
greater part of it is covered by largest-scale firms which, either individually
or in concert, are able to manipulate prices even without differentiating
products—the case of Oligopoly. Again the monopoly schema, suitably
adapted, seems to fit this type of behavior much better than does the
schema of perfect competition.

As soon as the prevalence of monopolistic competition or of oligopoly
or of combinations of the two is recognized, many of the propositions which
the Marshall-Wicksell generation of economists used to teach with the
utmost confidence become either inapplicable or much more difficult to
prove. This holds true, in the first place, of the propositions turning on the
fundamental concept of equilibrium, i.e., a determinate state of the economic
organism, toward which any given state of it is always gravitating and which
displays certain simple properties. In the general case of oligopoly there is
in fact no determinate equilibrium at all and the possibility presents itself
that there may be an endless sequence of moves and countermoves, an

<!-- 9 See, in particular, E.S.Chamberlin, Theory of Monopolistic Competition, and Joan
Robinson. The Economics of Imperfect Competition. -->

indefinite state of warfare between firms. It is true that there are many special
cases in which a state of equilibrium theoretically exists. In the second place,
even in these cases not only is it much harder to attain than the equilibrium
in perfect competition, and still harder to preserve, but the “beneficial”
competition of the classic type seems likely to be replaced by “predatory”
or “cutthroat” competition or simply by struggles for control in the financial
sphere. These things are so many sources of social waste, and there are many
others such as the costs of advertising campaigns, the suppression of new
methods of production (buying up of patents in order not to use them) and
so on. And most important of all: under the conditions envisaged,
equilibrium, even if eventually attained by an extremely costly method, no
longer guarantees either full employment or maximum output in the sense
of the theory of perfect competition. It may exist without full employment;
it is bound to exist, so it seems, at a level of output below that maximum
mark, because profit-conserving strategy, impossible in conditions of perfect
competition, now not only becomes possible but imposes itself.
Well, does not this bear out what the man in the street (unless a
businessman himself) always thought on the subject of private business? Has
not modern analysis completely refuted the classical doctrine and justified
the popular view? Is it not quite true after all, that there is little parallelism
between producing for profit and producing for the consumer and that private
enterprise is little more than a device to curtail production in order to extort
profits which then are correctly described as tolls and ransoms?
