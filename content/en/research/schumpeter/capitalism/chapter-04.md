THE main components of the Marxian structure are now before us. What
about the imposing synthesis as a whole? The question is not otiose. If
ever it is true, it is in this case that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.
Moreover, the synthesis may have so spoiled the wheat or so utilized the chaff,
both of which are present in almost every spot, that the whole might be more
true or more false than any part of it is, taken by itself. Finally, there is the
Message that proceeds only from the whole. Of the latter however no more
will be said. Each of us must settle for himself what it means to him.
Our time revolts against the inexorable necessity of specialization and
therefore cries out for synthesis, nowhere so loudly as in the social sciences
in which the non-professional element counts for so much. 1 But Marx’s
system illustrates well that, though synthesis may mean new light, it also
means new fetters.

We have seen how in the Marxian argument sociology and economics
pervade each other. In intent, and to some degree also in actual practice, they
are one. All the major concepts and propositions are hence both economic
and sociological and carry the same meaning on both planes—if, from our
standpoint, we may still speak of two planes of argument. Thus, the
economic category “labor” and the social class “proletariat” are, on principle
at least, made congruent, in fact identical. Or the economists’ functional
distribution—that is to say, the explanation of the way in which incomes
emerge as returns to productive services irrespective of what social class any
recipient of such a return may belong to—enters the Marxian system only
in the form of distribution between social classes and thus acquires a
different connotation. Or capital in the Marxian system is capital only if in
the hands of a distinct capitalist class. The same things, if in the hands of
the workmen, are not capital.

There cannot be any doubt about the access of vitality which comes to
analysis thereby. The ghostly concepts of economic theory begin to breathe.

<!--  1 The non-professional element is particularly strongly represented among those admirers
of Marx who, going beyond the attitude of the typical Marxian economist, still take at face value
everything he wrote. This is very significant. In every national group of Marxists there are at
least three laymen to every trained economist and even this economist is as a rule a Marxist
only in that qualified sense defined in the introduction to this part: he worships at the shrine,
but he turns his back upon it when he does his research. -->

The bloodless theorem descends into agmen, pulverem et clamorem; without
losing its logical quality, it is no longer a mere proposition about the logical
properties of a system of abstractions; it is the stroke of a brush that is
painting the wild jumble of social life. Such analysis conveys not only richer
meaning of what all economic analysis describes but it embraces a much
broader field—it draws every kind of class action into its picture, whether
or not this class action conforms to the ordinary rules of business procedure.
Wars, revolutions, legislation of all types, changes in the structure of
governments, in short all the things that non-Marxian economics treats
simply as external disturbances do find their places side by side with, say,
investment in machinery or bargains with labor—everything is covered by
a single explanatory schema.

At the same time, such procedure has its shortcomings. Conceptual
arrangements that are subject to a yoke of this kind may easily lose in
efficiency as much as they gain in vividness. The pair, worker-proletarian, may
serve as a telling if somewhat trite example. In non-Marxian economics all
returns to services of persons partake of the nature of wages, whether those
persons are tophole lawyers, movie stars, company executives or street
sweepers. Since all these returns have, from the standpoint of the economic
phenomenon involved, much in common, this generalization is not futile or
sterile. On the contrary, it may be enlightening, even for the sociological aspect
of things. But by equating labor and proletariat we obscure it; in fact, we
entirely banish it from our picture. Similarly, a valuable economic theorem
may by its sociological metamorphosis pick up error instead of richer meaning
and vice versa. Thus, synthesis in general and synthesis on Marxian lines in
particular might easily issue in both worse economics and worse sociology.
Synthesis in general, i.e., coordination of the methods and results of
different lines of advance, is a difficult thing which few are competent to
tackle. In consequence it is ordinarily not tackled at all and from the students
who are taught to see only individual trees we hear discontented clamor for
the forest. They fail to realize however that the trouble is in part an embarras
de richesse and that the synthetic forest may look uncommonly like an
intellectual concentration camp.

Synthesis on Marxian lines, i.e., coordination of economic and sociological
analysis with a view to bending everything to a single purpose, is of course
particularly apt to look like that. The purpose—that histoire raisonnée of
capitalist society—is wide enough but the analytic setup is not. There is indeed
a grand wedding of political facts and of economic theorems; but they are
wedded by force and neither of them can breathe. Marxists claim that their
system solves all the great problems that baffle non-Marxian economics; so it
does but only by emasculating them. This point calls for some elaboration.

I said a moment ago that Marx’s synthesis embraces all those historical
events—such as wars, revolutions, legislative changes—and all those social
institutions—such as property, contractual relations, forms of government—
that non-Marxian economists are wont to treat as disturbing factors or as
data, which means that they do not propose to explain them but only to
analyze their modi operandi and consequences. Such factors or data are of
course necessary in order to delimit the object and range of any research
program whatsoever. If they are not always expressly specified, that is only
because everyone is expected to know what they are. The trait peculiar to
the Marxian system is that it subjects those historical events and social
institutions themselves to the explanatory process of economic analysis or,
to use the technical lingo, that it treats them not as data but as variables.
Thus the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, the American Civil War, the
World War of 1914, the French Frondes, the great French Revolution, the
revolutions of 1830 and 1848, English free trade, the labor movement as a
whole as well as any of its particular manifestations, colonial expansion,
institutional changes, the national and party politics of every time and
country—all this enters the domain of Marxian economics which claims to
find theoretical explanations in terms of class warfare, of attempts at and
revolt against exploitation, of accumulation and of qualitative change in the
capital structure, of changes in the rate of surplus value and in the rate of
profit. No longer has the economist to be content with giving technical
answers to technical questions; instead, he teaches humanity the hidden
meaning of its struggles. No longer is “politics” an independent factor that
may and must be abstracted from in an investigation of fundamentals and,
when it does intrude, plays according to one’s preferences either the role of
a naughty boy who viciously tampers with a machine when the engineer’s
back is turned, or else the role of a deus ex machina by virtue of the
mysterious wisdom of a doubtful species of mammals deferentially referred
to as “statesmen.” No—politics itself is being determined by the structure
and state of the economic process and becomes a conductor of effects as
completely within the range of economic theory as any purchase or sale.
Once more, nothing is easier to understand than the fascination exerted by
a synthesis which does for us just this. It is particularly understandable in the
young and in those intellectual denizens of our newspaper world to whom the
gods seem to have granted the gift of eternal youth. Panting with impatience
to have their innings, longing to save the world from something or other,
disgusted with textbooks of un-describable tedium, dissatisfied emotionally and
intellectually, unable to achieve synthesis by their own effort, they find what
they crave for in Marx. There it is, the key to all the most intimate secrets,
the magic wand that marshals both great events and small. They are beholding an explanatory schema that at the same time is—if I may for a moment lapse
into Hegelianism—most general and most concrete. They need no longer feel
out of it in the great affairs of life—all at once they see through the pompous
marionettes of politics and business who never know what it is all about. And
who can blame them, considering available alternatives?

Yes, of course—but apart from that, what does this service of the
Marxian synthesis amount to? I wonder. The humble economist who
describes England’s transition to free trade or the early achievements of
English factory legislation is not, and never was, likely to forget to mention
the structural conditions of the English economy that produced those
policies. If he does not do so in a course or book on pure theory that
merely makes for neater and and more efficient analysis. What the Marxist
has to add is only the insistence on the principle, and a particularly narrow
and warped theory by which to implement it. This theory yields results no
doubt, and very simple and definite ones to boot. But we need only apply
it systematically to individual cases in order to grow thoroughly weary of
the unending jingle about the class war between owners and non-owners
and to become aware of a painful sense of inadequacy or, worse still, of
triviality—of the former, if we do not swear by the underlying schema; of
the latter, if we do.

Marxists are in the habit of pointing triumphantly to the success of the
Marxian diagnosis of the economic and social tendencies that are supposed
to be inherent in capitalist evolution. As we have seen, there is some
justification for this: more clearly than any other writer of his day Marx
discerned the trend toward big business and not only that but also some of
the features of the consequent situations. We have also seen that in this case
vision lent its aid to analysis so as to remedy some of the shortcomings of
the latter and to make the import of the synthesis truer than the contributing
elements of the analysis were themselves. But this is all. And against the
achievement must be set the failure of the prediction of increasing misery,
the joint result of wrong vision and faulty analysis, on which a great many
Marxian speculations about the future course of social events had been
based, He who places his trust in the Marxian synthesis as a whole in order
to understand present situations and problems is apt to be woefully wrong. 2
This seems in fact to be felt by many a Marxist just now.
2 Some Marxists would reply that non-Marxian economists have simply nothing to contribute
to our understanding of our time so that the disciple of Marx is nevertheless better off in that
respect. Waiving the question of whether it is better to say nothing or to say something that is
wrong, we should bear in mind that this is not true, for both economists and sociologists of
non-Marxian persuasions have as a matter of fact contributed substantially though mostly on
individual questions. Least of all can this Marxist claim be based on a comparison of Marx’s
teachings with that of the Austrians or of the Walras or Marshall schools. The members of these

In particular there is no reason for taking pride in the manner in which
the Marxian synthesis accounts for the experience of the last decade. Any
prolonged period of depression or of unsatisfactory recovery will verify
any pessimistic forecast exactly as well as it verifies the Marxian one. In
this case an impression to the contrary is created by the talk of
disheartened bourgeois and elated intellectuals which naturally acquired a
Marxian hue from their fears and hopes. But no actual fact warrants any
specifically Marxian diagnosis, still less an inference to the effect that what
we have been witnessing was not simply a depression, but the symptoms
of a structural change in the capitalist process such as Marx expected to
occur. For, as will be noted in the next part, all the phenomena observed
such as supernormal unemployment, lack of investment opportunity,
shrinkage of money values, losses and so on, come within the well-known
pattern of periods of predominating depression such as the seventies and
eighties on which Engels commented with a restraint that should set an
example to ardent followers of today.

Two outstanding examples will illustrate both the merits and the demerits
of the Marxian synthesis considered as a problem-solving engine.
First we will consider the Marxist theory of Imperialism. Its roots are all
to be found in Marx’s chief work, but it has been developed by the Neo-
Marxist school which flourished in the first two decades of this century and,
without renouncing communion with the old defenders of the faith, such as
Karl Kautsky, did much to overhaul the system. Vienna was its center; Otto
Bauer, Rudolf Hilferding, Max Adler were its leaders. In the field of
imperialism their work was continued, with but secondary shifts of emphasis,
by many others, prominent among whom were Rosa Luxemburg and Fritz
Sternberg. The argument runs as follows.

Since, on the one hand, capitalist society cannot exist and its economic
system cannot function without profits and since, on the other hand, profits
are constantly being eliminated by the very working of that system,
incessant effort to keep them alive becomes the central aim of the capitalist
class. Accumulation accompanied by qualitative change in the composition
of capital is, as we have seen, a remedy which though alleviating for the
moment the situation of the individual capitalist makes matters worse in
the end. So capital, yielding to the pressure of a falling rate of profits—it
falls, we recall, both because constant capital increases relative to variable
capital and because, if wages tend to rise and hours are being shortened,
the rate of surplus
groups were in most cases wholly, in all cases mainly, interested in economic theory. This
performance is hence incommensurable with Marx’s synthesis. It could only be compared with
Marx’s theoretical apparatus and in that field comparison is all to their advantage.
The Marxian Doctrine50
value falls—seeks for outlets in countries in which there is still labor
that can be exploited at will and in which the process of mechanization
has not as yet gone far. Thus we get an export of capital into undeveloped
countries which is essentially an export of capital equipment or of
consumers’ goods to be used in order to buy labor or to acquire things
with which to buy labor. 3 But it is also export of capital in the ordinary
sense of the term because the exported commodities will not be paid
for—at least not immediately—by goods, services or money from the
importing country. And it turns into colonization if, in order to safeguard
the investment both against hostile reaction of the native environment—
or if you please, against its resistance to exploitation—and against
competition from other capitalist countries, the undeveloped country is
brought into political subjection. This is in general accomplished by
military force supplied either by the colonizing capitalists themselves or
by their home government which thus lives up to the definition given in
the Communist Manifesto: “the executive of the modern State [is]…a
committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”
Of course, that force will not be used for defensive purposes only. There
will be conquest, friction between the capitalist countries and internecine
war between rival bourgeoisies.

Another element completes this theory of imperialism as it is now
usually presented. So far as colonial expansion is prompted by a falling
rate of profit in the capitalist countries, it should occur in the later stages
of capitalist evolution—Marxists in fact speak of imperialism as a stage,
preferably the last stage, of capitalism. Hence it would coincide with a
high degree of concentration of capitalist control over industry and with
a decline of the type of competition that characterized the times of the
small or medium-sized firm. Marx himself did not lay much stress on the
resulting tendency toward monopolistic restriction of output and on the
consequent tendency toward protecting the domestic game preserve
against the intrusion of poachers from other capitalist countries. Perhaps
he was too competent an economist to trust this line of argument too far.
But the Neo-Marxists were glad to avail themselves of it. Thus we get
not only another stimulus for imperialist policy and another source of
imperialist imbroglios but also, as a by-product, a theory of a phenomenon that is not necessarily imperialist in itself, modern
protectionism.

3 Think of luxuries to be traded to chieftains against slaves or to be traded against wage
goods with which to hire native labor. For the sake of brevity, I do not take account of the fact
that capital export in the sense envisaged will in general arise as a part of the total trade of
the two countries which also includes commodity transactions unconnected with the particular
process we have in mind. These transactions of course greatly facilitate that capital export, but
do not affect its principle. I shall also neglect other types of capital exports. The theory under
discussion is not, and is not intended to be, a general theory of international trade and finance.

Note one more hitch in that process that will stand the Marxist in good
stead in the task of explaining further difficulties. When the undeveloped
countries have been developed, capital export of the kind we have been
considering will decline. There may then be a period during which the
mother country and the colony will exchange, say, manufactured products
for raw materials. But in the end the exports of manufacturers will also
have to decline while colonial competition will assert itself in the mother
country. Attempts to retard the advent of that state of things will provide
further sources of friction, this time between each old capitalist country and
its colonies, of wars of independence and so on. But in any case colonial
doors will eventually be closed to domestic capital which will no longer
be able to flee from vanishing profits at home into richer pastures abroad.
Lack of outlets, excess capacity, complete deadlock, in the end regular
recurrence of national bankruptcies and other disasters—perhaps world
wars from sheer capitalist despair—may confidently be anticipated. History
is as simple as that.
This theory is a fair—perhaps it is the best—example of the way in
which the Marxian synthesis attempts to solve problems and acquires
authority by doing so. The whole thing seems to follow beautifully from
two fundamental premises that are both firmly embedded in the
groundwork of the system: the theory of classes and the theory of
accumulation. A series of vital facts of our time seems to be perfectly
accounted for. The whole maze of international politics seems to be cleared
up by a single powerful stroke of analysis. And we see in the process why
and how class action, always remaining intrinsically the same, assumes the
form of political or of business action according to circumstances that
determine nothing but tactical methods and phraseology. If, the means and
opportunities at the command of a group of capitalists being what they are,
it is more profitable to negotiate a loan, a loan will be negotiated. If, the
means and opportunities being what they are, it is more profitable to make
war, war will be made. The latter alternative is no less entitled to enter
economic theory than the former. Even mere protectionism now grows
nicely out of the very logic of capitalist evolution.
Moreover, this theory displays to full advantage a virtue that it has in
common with most of the Marxian concepts in the field of what is usually
referred to as applied economics. This is its close alliance with historical and
contemporaneous fact. Probably not one reader has perused my résumé
without being struck by the ease with which supporting historical instances
crowded in upon him at every single step of the argument. Has he not heard
The Marxian Doctrine52
of the oppression by Europeans of native labor in many parts of the world,
of what South and Central American Indians suffered at the hands of the
Spaniards for instance, or of slave-hunting and slave-trading and coolieism?
Is capital export not actually ever-present in capitalist countries? Has it not
almost invariably been accompanied by military conquest that served to
subdue the natives and to fight other European powers? Has not colonization
always had a rather conspicuous military side, even when managed entirely
by business corporations such as the East India Company or the British
South Africa Company? What better illustration could Marx himself have
desired than Cecil Rhodes and the Boer War? Is it not pretty obvious that
colonial ambitions were, to say the least, an important factor in European
troubles, at all events since about 1700? As for the present time, who has
not heard, on the one hand, about the “strategy of raw materials” and, on
the other hand, of the repercussions on Europe of the growth of native
capitalism in the tropics? And so on. As to protectionism—well, that is as
plain as anything can be.
But we had better be careful. An apparent verification by prima facie
favorable cases which are not analyzed in detail may be very deceptive.
Moreover, as every lawyer and every politician knows, energetic appeal to
familiar facts will go a long way toward inducing a jury or a parliament to
accept also the construction he desires to put upon them. Marxists have
exploited this technique to the full. In this instance it is particularly
successful, because the facts in question combine the virtues of being
superficially known to everyone and of being thoroughly understood by very
few. In fact, though we cannot enter into detailed discussion here, even hasty
reflection suffices to suggest a suspicion that “it is not so.”
A few remarks will be made in the next part on the relation in which the
bourgeoisie stands to imperialism. We shall now consider the question
whether, if the Marxian interpretation of capital export, colonization and
protectionism were correct, it would also be adequate as a theory of all the
phenomena we think of when using that loose and misused term. Of course
we can always define imperialism in such a way as to mean just what the
Marxian interpretation implies; and we can always profess ourselves
convinced that all those phenomena must be explainable in the Marxian
manner. But then the problem of imperialism—always granting that the
4 The danger of empty tautologies being put over on us is best illustrated by individual cases.
Thus, France conquered Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, and Italy conquered Abyssinia, by
military force without there being any significant capitalist interests to press for it. As a matter
of fact, presence of such interests was a pretense that was very difficult to establish, and the
subsequent development of such interests was a slow process that went on, unsatisfactorily
enough, under government pressure. If that should not look very Marxist, it will be replied that
action was taken under pressure of potential or anticipated capitalist interests or that in the last
Marx the Teacher 53
theory is in itself correct—would be “solved” only tautologically. 4 Whether
the Marxian approach or, for that matter, any purely economic approach
yields a solution that is not tautological would still have to be considered
This, however, need not concern us here, because the ground gives way
before we get that far.
At first sight, the theory seems to fit some cases tolerably well. The
most important instances are afforded by the English and Dutch conquests
in the tropics. But other cases, such as the colonization of New England,
it does not fit at all. And even the former type of case is not satisfactorily
described by the Marxian theory of imperialism. It would obviously not
suffice to recognize that the lure of gain played a role in motivating
colonial expansion. 5 The Neo-Marxists did not mean to aver such a horrible
platitude. If these cases are to count for them, it is also necessary that
colonial expansion came about, in the way indicated, under pressure of
accumulation on the rate of profit, hence as a feature of decaying, or at
all events of fully matured, capitalism. But the heroic time of colonial
adventure was precisely the time of early and immature capitalism when
accumulation was in its beginnings and any such pressure—also, in
particular, any barrier to exploitation of domestic labor—was conspicuous
by its absence. The element of monopoly was not absent. On the contrary
it was far more evident than it is today. But that only adds to the absurdity
of the construction which makes both monopoly and conquest specific
properties of latter-day capitalism.
Moreover, the other leg of the theory, class struggle, is in no better
condition. One must wear blinkers to concentrate on that aspect of colonial
expansion which hardly ever played more than a secondary role, and to
construe in terms of class struggle a phenomenon which affords some of
the most striking instances of class cooperation. It was as much a
movement toward higher wages as it was a movement toward higher
profits, and in the long run it certainly benefited (in part because of the
exploitation of native labor) the proletariat more than it benefited the
analysis some capitalist interest or objective necessity “must” have been at the bottom of it.
And we can then hunt for corroboratory evidence that will never be entirely lacking, since
capitalist interests, like any others, will in fact be affected by, and take advantage of, any
situation whatsoever, and since the particular conditions of the capitalist organism will always
present some features which may without absurdity be linked up with those policies of national
expansion. Evidently it is preconceived conviction and nothing else that keeps us going in a
task as desperate as this; without such a conviction it would never occur to us to embark upon
5 Nor is it sufficient to stress the fact that each country actually did “exploit” its colonies.
For that was exploitation of a country as a whole by a country as a whole (of all classes by all
classes) and has nothing to do with the specifically Marxian kind of exploitation. it. And we
really need not take the trouble; we might just as well say that “it must be so” and leave it at
that. This is what I meant by tautological explanation.
The Marxian Doctrine54
capitalist interest. But I do not wish to stress its effects. The essential point
is that its causation has not much to do with class warfare, and not more
to do with class structure than is implied in the leadership of groups and
individuals that belonged to, or by colonial enterprise rose into, the
capitalist class. If however we shake off the blinkers and cease to look
upon colonization or imperialism as a mere incident in class warfare, little
remains that is specifically Marxist about the matter. What Adam Smith has
to say on it does just as well—better in fact.
The by-product, the Neo-Marxian theory of modern protectionism,
still remains. Classical literature is full of invectives against the
“sinister interests”—at that time mainly, but never wholly, the agrarian
interests—which in clamoring for protection committed the
unforgivable crime against public welfare. Thus the classics had a
causal theory of protection all right—not only a theory of its effects—
and if now we add the protectionist interests of modern big business we
have gone as far as it is reasonable to go. Modern economists with
Marxist sympathies really should know better than to say that even now
their bourgeois colleagues do not see the relation between the trend
toward protectionism and the trend toward big units of control, though
these colleagues may not always think it necessary to stress so obvious
a fact. Not that the classics and their successors to this day were right
about protection: their interpretation of it was, and is, as one-sided as
was the Marxian one, besides being often wrong in the appraisal of
consequences and of the interests involved. But for at least fifty years
they have known about the monopoly component in protectionism all
that Marxists ever knew, which was not difficult considering the
commonplace character of the discovery.
And they were superior to the Marxist theory in one very important
respect. Whatever the value of their economics—perhaps it was not great—
they mostly 6 stuck to it. In this instance, that was an advantage. The
proposition that many protective duties owe their existence to the pressure
of large concerns that desire to use them for the purpose of keeping their
prices at home above what they otherwise would be, possibly in order to be
able to sell more cheaply abroad, is a platitude but correct, although no tariff
was ever wholly or even mainly due to this particular cause. It is the Marxian
synthesis that makes it inadequate or wrong. If our ambition is simply to
understand all the causes and implications of modern protectionism, political,
6 They did not always confine themselves to their economics. When they did not,
results were anything but encouraging. Thus, James Mill’s purely economic writings,
while not particularly valuable, cannot be simply dismissed as hopelessly substandard.
The real nonsense—and platitudinous nonsense at that—is in his articles on government
and cognate subjects.
Marx the Teacher 55
social and economic, then it is inadequate. For instance, the consistent
support given by the American people to protectionist policy, whenever they
had the opportunity to speak their minds, is accounted for not by any love
for or domination by big business, but by a fervent wish to build and keep
a world of their own and to be rid of all the vicissitudes of the rest of the
world. Synthesis that overlooks such elements of the case is not an asset but
a liability. But if our ambition is to reduce all the causes and implications
of modern protectionism, whatever they may be, to the monopolistic element
in modern industry as the sole causa causans and if we formulate that
proposition accordingly, then it becomes wrong. Big business has been able
to take advantage of the popular sentiment and it has fostered it; but it is
absurd to say that it has created it. Synthesis that yields—we ought rather
to say, postulates—such a result is inferior to no synthesis at all.
Matters become infinitely worse if, flying in the face of fact plus common
sense, we exalt that theory of capital export and colonization into the
fundamental explanation of international politics which thereupon resolves
into a struggle, on the one hand, of monopolistic capitalist groups with each
other and, on the other hand, of each of them with their own proletariat. This
sort of thing may make useful party literature but otherwise it merely shows
that nursery tales are no monopoly of bourgeois economics. As a matter of
fact, very little influence on foreign policy has been exerted by big
business—or by the haute finance from the Fuggers to the Morgans—and
in most of the cases in which large-scale industry as such, or banking
interests as such, have been able to assert themselves, their naïve dilettantism
has resulted in discomfiture. The attitudes of capitalist groups toward the
policy of their nations are predominantly adaptive rather than causative,
today more than ever. Also, they hinge to an astonishing degree on short-
run considerations equally remote from any deeply laid plans and from any
definite “objective” class interests. At this point Marxism degenerates into
the formulation of popular superstitions. 7
There are other instances of a similar state of things in all parts of the
Marxian structure. To mention one, the definition of the nature of governments
that was quoted from the Communist Manifesto a little while ago has certainly
7 This superstition is exactly on a par with another that is harbored by many worthy and
simple-minded people who explain modern history to themselves on the hypothesis that there
is somewhere a committee of supremely wise and malevolent Jews who behind the scenes
control international or perhaps all politics. Marxists are not victims of this particular
superstition but theirs is on no higher plane. It is amusing to record that, when faced with either
doctrine, I have always experienced great difficulty in replying in anything like a fashion
satisfactory to myself. This was not only due to the circumstance that it is always difficult to
establish denial of factual assertions. The main difficulty came from the fact that people, lacking
any first-hand knowledge of international affairs and their personnel, also lack any organ for
the perception of absurdity.
The Marxian Doctrine56
an element of truth in it. And in many cases that truth will account for
governmental attitudes toward the more obvious manifestations of class
antagonisms. But so far as true, the theory embodied in that definition is trivial.
All that is worth while troubling about is the Why and How of that vast
majority of cases in which the theory either fails to conform to fact or, even
if conforming, fails to describe correctly the actual behavior of those
“committees for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie.” Again, in
practically all cases the theory can be made tautologically true. For there is
no policy short of exterminating the bourgeoisie that could not be held to serve
some economic or extra-economic, short-run or long-run, bourgeois interest,
at least in the sense that it wards off still worse things. This, however, does
not make that theory any more valuable. But let us turn to our second example
of the problem-solving power of the Marxian synthesis.
The badge of Scientific Socialism which according to Marx is to distinguish
it from Utopian Socialism consists in the proof that socialism is inevitable
irrespective of human volition or of desirability. As has been stated before, all
this means is that by virtue of its very logic capitalist evolution tends to destroy
the capitalist and to produce the socialist order of things. 8 How far has Marx
succeeded in establishing the existence of these tendencies?
As regards the tendency toward self-destruction, the question has
already been answered. 9 The doctrine that the capitalist economy will
inevitably break down for purely economic reasons has not been
established by Marx, as Hilferding’s objections would suffice to show.
On the one hand, some of his propositions about future facts that are
essential to the orthodox argument, especially the one about the
inevitable increase of misery and oppression, are untenable; on the other
hand, the breakdown of the capitalist order would not necessarily follow
from these propositions, even if they were all true. But other factors in
the situation that the capitalist process tends to develop were correctly
seen by Marx, as was, so I hope to show, the ultimate outcome itself.
Concerning the latter, it may be necessary to replace the Marxian nexus
by another, and the term “breakdown” may then turn out to be a
misnomer, particularly if it be understood in the sense of a breakdown
caused by the failure of the capitalist engine of production; but this does
not affect the essence of the doctrine, however much it may affect its
formulation and some of its implications.
As regards the tendency toward socialism, we must first realize that this
is a distinct problem. The capitalist or any other order of things may
evidently break down—or economic and social evolution may outgrow it—

and yet the socialist phoenix may fail to rise from the ashes. There may be
chaos and, unless we define as socialism any non-chaotic alternative to
capitalism, there are other possibilities. The particular type of social
organization that the average orthodox Marxist—before the advent of
bolshevism at any rate—seemed to anticipate is certainly only one of many
possible cases.
Marx himself, while very wisely refraining from describing socialist
society in detail, emphasized conditions of its emergence: on the one hand,
the presence of giant units of industrial control—which, of course, would
greatly facilitate socialization—and, on the other hand, the presence of an
oppressed, enslaved, exploited, but also very numerous, disciplined, united
and organized proletariat. This suggests much about the final battle that is
to be the acute stage of the secular warfare between the two classes which
will then be arrayed against each other for the last time. It also suggests
something about what is to follow; it suggests the idea that the proletariat
as such will “take over” and, through its dictatorship, put a stop to the
“exploitation of man by man” and bring about classless society. If our
purpose were to prove that Marxism is a member of the family of chiliastic
creeds this would indeed be quite enough. Since we are concerned not with
that aspect but with a scientific forecast, it clearly is not. Schmoller was on
much safer ground. For though he also refused to commit himself to details,
he obviously visualized the process as one of progressive bureaucratization,
nationalization and so on, ending in state socialism which, whether we like
it or not, at least makes definite sense. Thus Marx fails to turn the socialist
possibility into a certainty even if we grant him the breakdown theory in its
entirety; if we do not, then failure follows a fortiori.
In no case, however—whether we accept Marx’s reasoning or any other—
will the socialist order be realized automatically; even if capitalist evolution
provided all conditions for it in the most Marxian manner conceivable,
distinct action would still be necessary to bring it about. 10 This of course is
in accordance with Marx’s teaching. His revolution is but the particular garb
in which his imagination liked to clothe that action. The emphasis on
violence is perhaps understandable in one who in his formative years had
experienced all the excitement of 1848 and who was, though quite able to
despise revolutionary ideology, yet never able to shake off its trammels.
Moreover, the greater part of his audience would hardly have been willing
to listen to a message that lacked the hallowed clarion call. Finally, though
he saw the possibility of peaceful transition, at least for England, he may
not have seen its likelihood. In his day it was not so easy to see, and his pet idea of the two classes in battle array made it still more difficult to see it.
His friend Engels actually went to the trouble of studying tactics. But though
the revolution can be relegated to the compound of non-essentials, the
necessity for distinct action still remains.

This should also solve the problem that has divided the disciples:
revolution or evolution? If I have caught Marx’s meaning, the answer is not
hard to give. Evolution was for him the parent of socialism. He was much
too strongly imbued with a sense of the inherent logic of things social to
believe that revolution can replace any part of the work of evolution. The
revolution comes in nevertheless. But it only comes in order to write the
conclusion under a complete set of premises. 

The Marxian revolution
therefore differs entirely, in nature and in function, from the revolutions both
of the bourgeois radical and of the socialist conspirator. It is essentially
revolution in the fullness of time.11 It is true that disciples who dislike this
conclusion, and especially its application to the Russian case, 12 can point to
many passages in the sacred books that seem to contradict it. But in those
passages Marx himself contradicts his deepest and most mature thought
which speaks out unmistakably from the analytic structure of Das Kapital
and—as any thought must that is inspired by a sense of the inherent logic
of things—carries, beneath the fantastic glitter of dubious gems, a distinctly
conservative implication. And, after all, why not? No serious argument ever
supports any “ism” un-conditionally. 13 To say that Marx, stripped of phrases,
admits of interpretation in a conservative sense is only saying that he can
be taken seriously.
11 This should be noticed for later reference. We shall repeatedly return to the subject and,
among other things, discuss the criteria of that “fullness of time.”
12 Karl Kautsky, in his preface to Theorien über den Mehrwert, even claimed the revolution
of 1905 for Marxian socialism, although it is patent that the Marxian phraseology of a few
intellectuals was all that was socialist about it.
13 This argument could be carried much further. In particular, there is nothing specifically
socialist in the labor theory of value; this of course everyone would admit who is familiar with
the historical development of that doctrine. But the same is true (excepting of course the phrase)
of the theory of exploitation. We need only recognize that existence of the surpluses so dubbed
by Marx is—or at least was—a necessary condition for the emergence of all that we comprise
in the term civilization (which in fact it would be difficult to deny), and there we are. In order
to be a socialist, it is of course not necessary to be a Marxist; but neither is it sufficient to be
a Marxist in order to be a socialist. Socialist or revolutionary conclusions can be impressed on
any scientific theory; no scientific theory necessarily implies them. And none will keep us in
what Bernard Shaw somewhere describes as sociological rage, unless its author goes out of his
way in order to work us up.
