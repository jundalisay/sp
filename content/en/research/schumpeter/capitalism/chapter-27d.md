IV. A DMINISTERING C APITALISM?


1. So far, then, we have not seen any convincing reason why the
experiments in political responsibility that socialist parties made after 1918
should not have been perfectly successful. To repeat: in some countries—
in Sweden for instance—socialists merely continued to consolidate a power
they had acquired before; in others, power had come naturally to them
without having to be conquered by revolutionary action; in all countries,
they seemed to be much more in a position to grapple with the great
problems of the time than was any other party. 

As I have put it before, they
almost seemed to monopolize the essential conditions for success.
Moreover, though most of them had not had any previous experience in
office, they had acquired plenty of experience of a most useful sort in
17 This of course particularly applies to the communist group or groups in the United States.
The conditions of American politics are not favorable to the growth of an official communist
party—a few county treasurerships do not go far from the recruiting standpoint. But the
importance of the communist element must not be measured by the membership of the official
party. Those intellectuals who are either straight communists or fellow travelers have really no
motive to join it. They have every motive to stay out of it, for they are much better able to
serve if, without carrying the badge, they conquer positions on opinion-producing committees
or in administrative bodies and so on, remaining free to deny, with perfect truth, that they are
communists in a party sense. Such invisible groups are incapable of concerted action except
for the lead from Moscow.

organizing, negotiating and in administration. In fact, it should be stated
at once that they hardly ever did a downright foolish thing. Finally, neither
the inevitable emergence of a new party to the left of the socialists nor the
connection of that party with Moscow was as serious for them as their
opponents tried to make out.

But in spite of all this, their situation was everywhere precarious. To the
true believer it might well have seemed an impossible one. For all those
tactical advantages hid a fundamental difficulty which they were powerless
to remove. The war and the upheaval caused by the war had brought the
socialists into office; but below the tatters of the old garb, the social
organism, and in particular the economic process, were still what they had
been before. That is to say, socialists had to govern in an essentially
capitalist world.

Marx had visualized the conquest of political power as the prerequisite
of socialization which was to be taken in hand immediately. This implied,
however, as in fact Marx’s argument implied throughout, that the opportunity
for that conquest would occur when capitalism had run its course or, to use
our own phrase again, when things and souls were ripe. The breakdown he
thought of was to be a breakdown of the economic engine of capitalism from
internal causes. 18 Political breakdown of the bourgeois world was to be a
mere incident to this. But now the political breakdown—or something akin
to it—had happened, and the political opportunity had occurred, while the
economic process was nowhere near maturity as yet. The “superstructure”
had moved more quickly than the propelling mechanism. It was a most un-
Marxian situation.
The student in his closet may speculate about what the course of things
would have been if the socialist parties, recognizing the state of things, had
refused the Trojan horse of office, remained in the opposition and allowed
the bourgeoisie to deal with the wreckage left by the war and by the peace.
Perhaps it would have been better for them, for socialism, for the world—
who knows? But for men who by that time had learned to identify
themselves with their nations and to take the point of view of responsibility
there was no choice. They resolutely faced what fundamentally was an
insoluble problem.

There was a social and economic system that would not function except
on capitalist lines. The socialists might control it, regulate it in the interest
of labor, squeeze it to the point of impairing its efficiency—but they were
unable to do anything specifically socialist. If they were to run it, they would
have to run it according to its logic. They would have to “administer
18 This in part explains the favor enjoyed in the United States by theories which aim at
showing that capitalism is as a matter of fact breaking down from internal causes. See ch. x. capitalism.” And this they did. Something was done to dress up their
measures in socialist phrases, and the magnifying glass was applied, with
some success, to every difference between their policy and what the
bourgeois alternative was in each case supposed to be. In substance however
they had to do what liberals or conservatives would also have done under
the same circumstances. But, though the only possible course, 19 this was, for
the socialist parties, a most dangerous one to pursue.

Not that it was entirely hopeless or, from the standpoint of the socialist
faith, entirely incapable of defense. At the beginning of the twenties,
socialists in Europe may well have hoped that, with luck and cautious
steering, they would establish themselves in or near the centers of
political power so as to be able to avert any danger of “reaction” and to
buttress the position of the proletariat until the day when it would be
possible to socialize society without any violent break; they would
preside over the euthanasia of bourgeois society and at the same time
make sure that the process of dying went on all right and that the victim
would not experience a comeback. But for the presence of other factors
than those which enter the socialist’s or the labor man’s picture of
society, this hope might have come true.

Defense from the standpoint of the Faith might have been based on the
proposition stated above, viz., that the situation was a novel one and had not
been foreseen by Marx. The bourgeois victim turning to the socialists for
shelter—such a case was evidently not provided for in his schema. It might
have been argued that under the circumstances even mere “administering
capitalism” was a great step in advance. Nor was it a question of
administering capitalism in the capitalist interest but of doing honest work
in the field of social reform, and of building a state that would pivot on the
workman’s interests. In any case that was the only thing to do if the
democratic road was to be chosen, for the immaturity of the situation
asserted itself precisely by the fact that there were no majorities to be had
for the socialist alternative. No wonder that the socialist parties which had
resolved to accept office under such circumstances loudly proclaimed their
allegiance to democracy!

Thus, the political hack’s craving for office was capable of justification
on the highest grounds of doctrine and proletarian interest. The reader will
have no difficulty in visualizing how such comfortable concordance must
have impressed radical critics. But since later events have induced so many
people to speak of the failure of that policy and to lecture the leaders of that

<!-- 19 I do not propose to discuss, as another possibility, an attempt at fundamental
reconstruction on Russian lines. For it seems to me too obvious that any such attempt would
have speedily ended in chaos and counterrevolution. -->

time on what they ought to have done, I do wish to emphasize both the
rationale of their views and the compelling nature of the pattern within which
they had to act. If failure there was, its causes must be looked for elsewhere
than in stupidity or treason. In order to convince ourselves of this we need
only glance at the English and German cases.

2. As soon as the orgy of nationalist sentiment that accompanied the close
of the war subsided, a genuinely revolutionary situation developed in
England, the temper of the masses asserting itself, for instance, by political
strikes. Responsible socialists and responsible laborites were so completely
driven together by these events—and by the danger of the nation’s being
goaded into a truly reactionary mood—that they henceforth accepted a
common leadership, at least as far as parliamentary maneuvering was
concerned. The lion’s share of the combined weight went to the labor interest
and, within the labor interest, to the bureaucracy of a few big unions so that
an opposition of disgruntled intellectuals developed almost at once. These
intellectuals objected to the laborite character of the alliance and professed
themselves unable to see anything socialist about it. The ideological
opportunism of the laborites lends some color to this view but, stressing the
facts of the situation rather than slogans, we shall nevertheless equate the
whole of the political labor forces, as far as they then accepted MacDonald’s
leadership, with the Social Democratic party of Germany.

Having successfully emerged from that revolutionary situation the party
steadily improved its position until MacDonald came into office in 1924. He
and his men made so creditable a showing that even malcontent intellectuals
were temporarily subdued. In matters of foreign and colonial policy, this
government was able to strike a note of its own—particularly with respect
to Russia. In domestic affairs, this was less easy to do, mainly because fiscal
radicalism had been (and continued to be) carried, quite as far as was
possible under the circumstances, by conservative governments dependent
upon a share in the labor vote. But while in legislation the labor government
did not go beyond comparative details, it proved itself qualified to administer
the nation’s affairs. Snowden’s excellent performance in the office of
chancellor of the exchequer would have sufficed to show to the nation and
to the world that labor was fit to govern. And this was in itself a service to
the cause of socialism. 20


<!-- 20 Moreover, from the standpoint of party tactics, it made things much more difficult for
the conservatives than headstrong radicalism would have done. -->

Of course that success was greatly facilitated and any other kind of
success was rendered more difficult or even impossible by the fact that the
labor government was in a minority and had to rely not only on the
cooperation of the liberals—with whom they had much in common, for instance their free-trade views—but also, to some extent, on the tolerance
of the conservatives. They were in much the same situation as the
conservatives were during their short spells of office in the 1850’s and
1860’s. It would not have been so easy for them to take a responsible attitude
if they had had a majority. But, as stated above, the very fact that they had
not should have proved even to a Marxist tribunal that the time had not yet
come for a stronger course of action—at all events, on any plan that would
answer democratic requirements.

The rank and file however did not appreciate all this. Still less did the
masses realize that they owed to the labor party not only what that party itself
accomplished but also part of what was being done for them by its
conservative competitor for the labor vote. They missed spectacular proposals
of reconstruction and promises of immediate benefits, and did not know how
unfair they were when they naïvely asked: “Why don’t the socialists do
something for us now they are in power?” The intellectuals who did not relish
being sidetracked naturally availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by
this mood in order to attack the sway of the laborites over the true socialists
and to work up current grievances into horrible wrongs callously neglected by
tyrannical trade-union bureaucrats. Under their influence the Independent
Labor party grew increasingly restive during the subsequent years of
opposition especially when MacDonald proved impervious to their arguments
for a more radical program.21 Thus, to many people, success looked much like
failure, and responsibility much like cowardice.

This was unavoidable however. The difficulties and dangers that are
inherent in a policy of socialist parties which involves accepting office under
conditions of “immaturity” are still better illustrated by the history of
MacDonald’s second ministry. 22 Historians have learned to do justice to the

21 That program primarily ran in terms of the socialization of banking and of certain key
industries and hence was not really on the lines of orthodox socialism. But under the
circumstances it was advertised as the genuine thing whereas MacDonald’s was styled
“reformist”—a term which according to classical usage applies equally well to the I.L.P.
program.
22 Readers may miss a comment on the general strike of 1926. Though it was to the interest
of both parties to the contest to minimize its symptomatic importance and though the official
theories of it have been shaped accordingly, it was much more than a series of tactical errors
issuing in a situation in which the trade-union congress had to “bluff” and the conservative
government had to “call the bluff.” We need only ask ourselves what the consequences of a
success would have been, for the authority of government and for democracy, in order to realize
that the strike was an historical event of the first order of importance. If that weapon had proved
effective, the trade unions would have become absolute masters of England and no other
political, judicial or economic power could have continued to exist beside them except on
sufferance. And in this position they could not have remained what they were. However
reluctantly, the leaders would have had to use the absolute power thrust upon them.
For our purpose, only two points need be noticed. First, the situation described above, in
particular the discontent that spread among the rank and file and was sedulously fostered by


statesmanship of Sir Robert Peel. 23 I trust that they will learn to do justice
to the statesmanship of MacDonald. He had the singular misfortune of
coming in at the very beginning of the world depression which, moreover,
was the immediate cause of the breakdown of the international system
embodied in the League of Nations.

Lesser men might have thought—lesser men did think, as a matter of
fact—that an opportunity had come for fundamental reconstruction. This
would have rent the nation in two and there cannot be any doubt about
what the result would have been. Short of fundamental reconstruction,
however, a policy of monetary expansion combined with less-than-
fundamental social reform—individual measures of nationalization for
instance and additional security legislation—and resort to mercantilist
policies in the field of international relations was being widely
recommended. But part of this program would undoubtedly have
intensified the depression, and the rest of it—abandonment of the gold
parity of the pound and mercantilism—meant so radical a break with the
national tradition and with the tradition of the labor party itself that the
socialists would hardly have been able to carry it, still less to make a
success of it; to carry it safely and effectively it had to be carried by
consent, that is to say, by a coalition.

So long as coalition was not possible, therefore, MacDonald and his men
applied themselves to the task of working the system as they found it. This,
under such conditions, was the most difficult of all the tasks they could have
undertaken. While everybody was clamoring that “something” must be done
at once, while irresponsibles of all types had the floor to themselves, while
the masses were grumbling, businessmen despairing, intellectuals ranting,
they steadily fought every inch of their ground. At home they kept order in
the finances, they supported the pound and they refrained from speeding up
the legislative machine. Abroad they strove with desperate energy—and
considerable success—to make the Geneva system work and to reduce
dangers and tensions all around. When the time had come and the national
interest seemed to warrant the party risk, they took the plunge and helped
the National Government into existence.

It is a melancholy reflection that, in many and important cases, a policy
many irresponsible elements, had much to do with the causation of the strike. Second, the strike
did not impair the power of the party-as it might have done. On the contrary, defeat seems to
have produced a radicalization of the masses which partly accounts for the party’s success in
1929.

<!-- 23 The analogy extends from certain features of the political and economic situations that
confronted both men (although Peel had the advantage of entering upon office after the crisis
of 1836–1839) to matters of political detail. In both cases there was a party split, boldly risked
and eventually boldly accepted; in both cases the leaders were felt to be “traitors.” -->

is bound to be the more unpopular with the public and with the intellectual
critic the wiser it is. This is a case in point. To the radical critic who failed
to link up that policy with the comparative mildness of the depression in
England and with the steadiness of the subsequent recovery, there was
nothing in it except weakness, incompetence, hidebound traditionalism, if
not traitorous abandonment of the socialist cause. What probably was one
of the best performances in the history of democratic politics and one of
the best examples of action responsibly decided on from a correct
perception of an economic and social situation, the critic looked upon with
“shame and disgust.” At best he considered MacDonald simply as a bad
jockey who had brought the horse to its knees. But the hypothesis that
appealed to him most was that the MacDonald government yielded to the
diabolical whisperings (or worse) of English bankers or to the pressure of
their American backers.

Unfortunately, such nonsense is a factor of real importance and must
be taken account of in any attempt at prognosis. It may seriously interfere
with the ability of socialist parties to serve the cause of civilization
during the transitional age in which we live. But if we discard this
element and also the truism that any party which makes a sacrifice in the
national interest will suffer for it in the short run, we shall have little
difficulty in recognizing that in the long run the labor influence may well
turn out to have been strengthened by MacDonald’s second tenure of
office. Again the analogy with Sir Robert Peel’s second ministry will help
to illustrate this. Peel’s conservative majority split on the issue of the
repeal of the corn laws. The Peelite wing, though much more numerous
and important than MacDonald’s personal following, soon disintegrated.
The conservative party was maimed and proved unable to get into
power—though it got three times into office—until Disraeli’s great
victory in 1873. But after that and until Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman’s victory in 1905, it held power for about two-thirds of the
time. More important than this, the English aristocracy and gentry,
politically speaking, held their own all the time much better than they
would have done if the stigma of dear bread had not been removed.
As a matter of fact, the labor party quickly recovered and consolidated
its position in the country during the years that followed upon the split.
It is safe to say that even in the normal course of things—irrespective of
the war, that is—the socialists would have again come into office before
long, with increased power and better chances of success, and that they
would have been able to take a stronger line than they had taken
previously. But it is equally safe to say that both as to their program and
as to their ability to give effect to it, their policy would have differed only

in degree from the MacDonald policy—principally by some individual
measures of socialization.

3. The postwar career of the German Social Democratic party of course
differs from that of the English labor party in many particulars. But as soon
as the German socialists who stayed in the Social Democratic party had
accepted office and made up their minds to fight communism they were just
as much committed to “administer capitalism” as were their English
colleagues. If we grant these premises and take account of the fact that they
did not have, and could not expect to have in the calculable future, a majority
either in the federal parliament or in the Prussian diet or in the population,
everything else follows with inexorable logic. In 1925 the total population was
about 62 millions. The proletariat (laborers and their families; I include the
domestic servants) numbered not quite 28 millions and part of the vote of this
class went to other parties. The “independent” population was not much
smaller—about 24 millions—and largely impervious to the socialist
persuasion. Even if we exclude an upper stratum—say one million—and
confine ourselves to the groups that count at the polls—the peasants, artisans,
retailers—there was not much to be conquered there, not only for the moment
but even for the near future. Between these two groups there were the white-
collar employees, no less than 10 millions of them including their families. The
Social Democratic party of course realized that this class held the key position,
and made great efforts to conquer it. But in spite of considerable success, these
efforts only served to show that the white collar is a much more serious barrier
than it should be according to the Marxian theory of social classes.24
Thus, even if the communists had been the allies of the Social Democrats
instead of being their bitterest enemies, the party would still have been in
the minority. It is true that the non-socialist majority was not actively hostile
in all its sections: the left-wing liberals (the Democratic People’s party),
stronger in talent than in numbers, were always ready for cooperation (up
to a point). It is also true that this majority was split up into many groups
which were quite incapable of acting in unison and whose members and
supporters were not anything like as disciplined as were the Social
Democrats themselves. But sensible people who were neither able nor

24 When confronted with this fact socialists usually derive comfort from the arguments
that non-socialist employees are just erring sheep who have not yet found their true political
location but who are sure to find it eventually, or that they are prevented from joining the
party by the ruthless pressure exerted by their employers. The first argument will not carry
conviction to anyone beyond the Marxian fold—we have seen that the theory of social classes
is one of the weakest links in the Marxian chain. The second argument is false as a matter
of plain fact. Whatever truth it may have contained at other times, the German employers of
the twenties were, save exceptions without quantitative importance, in no position to influence
the vote of their employees.

willing to embark upon hazardous courses would nevertheless feel that there
was for them but one line to take—the line of democracy—and that this line
spelled coalition.

The party that best qualified for the role of an ally was the Catholic party
(the Center). It was powerful. Before the advent of Hitler it seemed that
nothing could shake the loyalty of its supporters. Its organization was
excellent. Provided the interests of the church were safeguarded, it was
prepared to go nearly as far in social reform of the immediately practical
kind as were the socialists themselves, in some respects even further. Not
harboring any particularly fervent feelings for the displaced dynasties, it
stood squarely behind the Weimar constitution. Last but not least, it
welcomed spoils-sharing arrangements that would guarantee its preserves.
Thus understanding came about with what to the foreign observer might
seem surprising ease. The socialists treated the Catholic Church with the
utmost deference and tact. They made no difficulties about a concordat with
the pope that gave the clergy more than it ever had had under the heretic
Hohenzollerns. As to policies, there were hardly any dissensions at all.
But although this alliance was fundamental, no party that professed
allegiance to the Weimar constitution was excluded from office. Democrats,
National Liberals, Nationals (=Conservatives) were all of them admitted,
even to positions of high command. Coalition as a universal principle meant
compromise as a universal principle. The necessary concessions as to
measures were in fact readily made. The army was left alone, practically
under management of its own choosing, and adequately provided with
means. Eastern Prussia was subsidized and agriculture in general was the
object of solicitous care. Some implications of this which might not quite
tally with socialist professions were made more palatable to the proletariat
that paid the bill by calling this sort of thing Planning—perhaps the reader
feels that there is nothing new under the sun.

In its attitude toward the industrial masses and toward its own program
the Social Democratic party laborized itself. At the beginning a token
payment was made by the passing of a very moderate bill of which the most
radical feature consisted in the word Socialization that was inserted in its title
(1919). But the socialists soon shelved all this in order to apply themselves
to labor legislation of the kind made familiar to Americans by the New Deal.
This satisfied the trade unions whose bureaucracy was increasingly allowed
to form the operative section of the party’s policy-making machine.
This, so one might think, should have been difficult for a party with a
Marxian tradition that continued to prevail in the party schools. But it was not.
Except for a certain amount of communist defection, the intellectuals from
whom opposition within the party could have been expected to arise were kept well in hand. Unlike the English party, the German one had settled down in
the administrative apparatus of the Reich, the states and the municipalities.
Moreover, it had, in its press and elsewhere, many jobs of its own to offer. This
patronage was energetically used. Obedience spelled preferment in the civil
service, in the academic career, in the numerous public enterprises and so on.
These means were effective in bringing radicals to heel.

The firm hold the Social Democrats acquired on all the parts of the
machinery of public administration not only made for stricter discipline but
also helped to increase membership and, beyond membership, the vote on
which the party was able to count. Of course it also increased its power in
other ways. For instance, the socialists secured dominant power in the
Prussian Free State. This gave them control of the police force and they
were careful to choose party members or reliable careerists for police
presidents (chiefs of police) in the big towns. Thus they buttressed their
camp until their position seemed impregnable according to all ordinary
standards. And, again according to all ordinary rules of political analysis,
even an orthodox Marxist could have comforted himself by arguing that
in those trenches they could quite comfortably dwell till things in their
secular course would of themselves change minority into majority and
draw the curtains that veiled the Ultimate Goal for the time being.
Quotation from the Communist Manifesto…

Irrespective of the mechanics of the party’s power plant, the political
setup as well as the general social situation looked eminently stable.
Moreover, whatever might be urged against many individual measures,
legislative and administrative, on the whole the coalition’s policies made for
and not against stability. Much that was done must command our sincere
respect. Nothing that was done qualifies for explanation of anything worse
than the ordinary measure of discontent that every regime elicits which lacks
authority and glamour. The only possible exception to this lies in the
financial sphere. Part of the cultural and political achievements of this
governmental system was associated with large and rapidly increasing public
expenditure. Furthermore, this expenditure was financed by methods—
though a highly successful sales tax was among them—which drained the
sources of accumulation. So long as the inflow of foreign capital continued,
all went comparatively well, although budgetary and even cash difficulties
began to appear more than a year before it ceased. When it did cease, that
well-known situation emerged which would have undermined the position
of the most magnetic of leaders. All in all, however, the socialist critics of
the party and its conduct during this spell of power will be entitled to boast
of no mean achievement if, in case they were ever installed in office, they
should do equally well
