THIS volume is the result of an effort to weld into a readable form the
bulk of almost forty years’ thought, observation and research on the
subject of socialism. The problem of democracy forced its way into the place
it now occupies in this volume because it proved impossible to state my views
on the relation between the socialist order of society and the democratic
method of government without a rather extensive analysis of the latter.
My task turned out more difficult than I thought it would be. Part of the
heterogeneous material that had to be marshaled reflected the views and
experiences of an individual who at various stages of his life had more
opportunity for observation that non-socialists usually have and who reacted
to what he saw in an unconventional manner. I had no wish to obliterate the
traces of this: much of such interest as this book may command would have
gone if I had tried to smooth them away.

Moreover, this material also reflected the analytic efforts of an individual who,
while always honestly trying to probe below the surface, never made the problems
of socialism the principal subject of his professional research for any length of time
and therefore has much more to say on some topics than on others. In order to
avoid creating the impression that I aimed at writing a well-balanced treatise I have
thought it best to group my material around five central themes. Links and bridges
between them have been provided of course and something like systematic unity
of presentation has, I hope, been achieved. But in essence they are—though not
independent—almost self-contained pieces of analysis.

The first part sums up, in a non-technical manner, what I have to say—
and what, as a matter of fact, I have been teaching for some decades—on
the subject of the Marxian doctrine. To preface a discussion of the main
problems of socialism by an exposition of the Gospel would be the natural
thing for a Marxist to do. But what is the purpose of this exposition in the
hall of a house built by one who is not a Marxist? It stands there to bear
witness to this non-Marxist’s belief in the unique importance of that
message, an importance that is completely independent of acceptance or
rejection. But it makes difficult reading. And no Marxian tools are used in
the subsequent work. Though the results of the latter are again and again
compared with the tenets of the one great socialist thinker, readers who are
not interested in Marxism may hence start with Part II.


In the second part—Can Capitalism Survive?—I have tried to show that
a socialist form of society will inevitably emerge from an equally inevitable
decomposition of capitalist society. Many readers will wonder why I thought
so laborious and complex an analysis necessary in order to establish what
is rapidly becoming the general opinion, even among conservatives. The
reason is that, while most of us agree as to the result, we do not agree as to
the nature of the process that is killing capitalism and as to the precise
meaning to be attached to the word “inevitable.” Believing that most of the
arguments offered—both on Marxian and on more popular lines—are wrong,
I felt it my duty to take, and to inflict upon the reader, considerable trouble
in order to lead up effectively to my paradoxical conclusion: capitalism is
being killed by its achievements.

Having seen, as I think we shall see, that socialism is a practical
proposition that may become immediately practical in consequence of the
present war, we shall in the third part—Can Socialism Work?—survey a large
expanse of problems that bear upon the conditions in which the socialist
order may be expected to be an economic success. This part comes nearest
to being a balanced treatment of its various topics including the “transitional”
problems. Love and hate have so blurred the results of such serious work as
has so far been done on this question—it is not much—that even mere
restatement of widely accepted views seemed justified here and there.
The fourth part—Socialism and Democracy—is a contribution to a
controversy that has been going on in this country for some time. But it
should be noted that only a question of principle is dealt with in this part.
Facts and comments relevant to the subject are scattered all over the book
particularly in Parts III and V.

The fifth part is what it purports to be, a sketch. More than in the other parts,
I wished to confine myself to what I had to say from personal observation and
from very fragmentary research. Therefore the material that went into this part
is no doubt woefully incomplete. But what there is of it, is alive.
No part of the contents of this volume has ever appeared in print. An early
draft of the argument of Part II has however provided the basis for a lecture
delivered at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Graduate School on January
18, 1936, and has been mimeographed by that School. I wish to thank Mr.
A.C.Edwards, chairman of the Arrangements Committee, for permission to
include an extended version in this volume.

THIS edition reproduces the book of 1942 without any change whatever
except that a new chapter has been added. The reason why I have even
refrained from verbal alterations which were clearly indicated in a number
of places is that, in matters of the kind treated in this book, it is impossible
to alter phrasing without also altering meaning or at least incurring the
suspicion of having done so. And I do attach some importance to the fact
that neither the events of the last four years nor the criticisms proffered in
reviews have affected my diagnoses and prognoses which, on the contrary,
seem to me to be fully borne out by such new facts as have appeared. The
sole aim of the new chapter is to develop, in the light of these new facts,
certain points made in the old text, particularly in Chapter XIX, Section IV
and Chapter XXVII, Section V and to show how the present situation fits
into the philosophy of history adumbrated in this book. In this preface I am
going to notice some criticisms or rather types of criticisms that have been
directed against it—not necessarily in print. But I wish to do so because I
hope that such answers as I have to offer may prove of some use to readers
and not because I have any fault to find with the reception of the book. On
the contrary I want to use this opportunity for expressing my gratitude to
its reviewers for their unvarying courtesy and kindness and to its translators
into seven foreign languages for their generous efforts.

First of all let me notice two criticisms of a professional nature. An eminent
economist of international reputation has expressed dissent from my proposition
that, as part of the social process described in this book, there is a long-run
tendency for profits to vanish: Sales effort, he said, will always command its
price. I do not think that there is any real difference between us, only we use
the term “profits” in different senses. Such sales effort as may still be required
in an economy that has settled down to stable routine, will undoubtedly have to
reap its return as will every other kind of activity incident to the management
of a business. But I include this with wages of management in order to single
out and emphasize what I believe to be the fundamental source of industrial gain,
the profits that the capitalist order attaches to successful introduction of new
goods or new methods of production or new forms of organizations. I do not
see how it could be denied that industrial history testifies convincingly to the
importance of this element of capitalist returns. And I hold that with increasing 
mechanization of industrial “progress” (teamwork in research departments and
so on) this element and with it the most important pillar of the capitalist class’s
economic position is bound to crumble in time.

The most frequent criticism of the purely economic argument of this
book that I have heard—it sometimes rose to expostulation—was,
however, directed against what many readers considered to be a defense
of monopolistic practice. Yes, I do believe that most of the current talk
about monopoly, like all the current talk about the dire effects of saving,
is nothing but radical ideology and has no foundation in fact. In lighter
moods, I occasionally express myself more strongly than this especially
on the “policies,” actual and proposed, that are based upon that ideology.
But here, and as a matter of professional duty, I merely wish to state that
all the reader finds in this book about monopoly reduces, in the last
analysis, to the following propositions which I hold no competent
economist can deny.

1. The classical theory of monopolistic pricing (the Cournot-Marshall
theory) is not entirely valueless, especially when overhauled so as to deal
not only with the instantaneous maximization of monopoly gain but also
with maximization over time. But it works with assumptions that are so
restrictive as to exclude its direct application to reality. In particular it
cannot be used for what it is being used in current teaching, namely, for a
comparison between the way in which a purely competitive economy
functions and the way in which an economy functions that contains
substantial elements of monopoly. The main reason for this is that the
theory assumes given demand and cost conditions, the same for the
competitive and the monopolistic case, whereas it is of the essence of
modern big business that its demand and cost conditions are, for large
quantities of output, much more favorable—and inevitably so—than the
demand and cost conditions that would exist in the same industries in a
régime of perfect competition.

2. Current economic theory is almost wholly a theory of the
administration of a given industrial apparatus. But much more important
than the manner in which capitalism administers given industrial
structures is the manner in which it creates them. (See Chapters VII and
VIII.) And into this process of creation the monopoly element enters
necessarily. This puts an entirely different complexion upon the
monopoly problem and on legislative and administrative methods of
dealing with it.

3. Third, economists who thunder against cartels and other methods of
industrial self-government often assert nothing that is wrong in itself. But
they leave out the necessary qualifications. And to leave out necessary qualifications is not to present the whole truth. There are other things to
mention but I refrain in order to turn to a second class of objections.
I thought I had taken every care to make it quite clear that this is not
a political book and that I did not wish to advocate anything.
Nevertheless, to my amusement, the intention has been imputed to me—
and more than once though not, so far as I know, in print—of “advocating
foreign collectivism.” I mention this fact not for its own sake but in order
to notice another objection that lurks behind this one. If I was not
advocating collectivism, foreign or domestic, or indeed anything else,
why then did I write at all? Is it not entirely futile to elaborate inferences
from observed facts without arriving at practical recommendations? I was
greatly interested whenever I met with this objection—it is such a nice
symptom of an attitude that accounts for much in modern life. We always
plan too much and always think too little. We resent a call to thinking
and hate unfamiliar argument that does not tally with what we already
believe or would like to believe. We walk into our future as we walked
into the war, blindfolded. Now this is precisely where I wanted to serve
the reader. I did want to make him think. And in order to do so it was
essential not to divert his attention by discussions about what from any
given standpoint “should be done about it” which would have
monopolized his interest. Analysis has a distinct task and to this task I
wished to keep though I was fully aware of the fact that this resolve
would cost me a great deal of the response a few pages of practical
conclusions would have evoked.

This, finally, leads to the charge of “defeatism.” I deny entirely that
this term is applicable to a piece of analysis. Defeatism denotes a certain
psychic state that has meaning only in reference to action. Facts in
themselves and inferences from them can never be defeatist or the
opposite whatever that might be. The report that a given ship is sinking
is not defeatist. Only the spirit in which this report is received can be
defeatist: The crew can sit down and drink. But it can also rush to the
pumps. If the men merely deny the report though it be carefully
substantiated, then they are escapists. Morever, even if my statements of
tendencies amounted more definitely to prediction than they were
intended to do, they would still not carry defeatist suggestions. What
normal man will refuse to defend his life merely because he is quite
convinced that sooner or later he will have to die anyhow? This applies
to both the groups from which the charge has come: sponsors of private-
enterprise society and sponsors of democratic socialism. Both of them
stand to gain if they see more clearly than they usually do the nature of
the social situation in which it is their fate to act.
Preface to the Second Edition, 1946414
Frank presentation of ominous facts was never more necessary than it is
today because we seem to have developed escapism into a system of thought.
This is my motive as it is my apology for writing the new chapter. The facts
and inferences there presented are certainly not pleasant or comfortable. But
they are not defeatist. Defeatist is he who. while giving lip service to
Christianity and all the other values of our civilization, yet refuses to rise in
their defense—no matter whether he accepts their, defeat as a foregone
conclusion or deludes himself with futile hopes against hope. For this is one
of those situations in which optimism is nothing but a form of defection.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION, 1949
T HIS new edition gives me the opportunity to comment, from the
standpoint of this book, upon the English developments of the last two
years—to insert them, as it were, into the general framework of the analysis
that I have endeavoured to construct. In the time and space at my disposal,
it is but membra disjecta that I have to offer. But there is also another point
that I wish to be clearly understood from the outset. Nothing is farther from
my mind than any intention to criticize another country’s policy or to offer
“advice.” I should consider this to be nothing short of impertinent. If certain
turns of phrase nevertheless read as if I harbored such an intention, readers
will please realize that this is merely one of the many undesirable
consequences of extreme brevity.
Before reading what follows, readers should peruse Section IV of Chapter
XIX and Section I of Chapter XXVIII, which I have left unchanged, as I
have the rest of the book.
1. Viewed from our standpoint as well as from any other, the English
picture is complicated, and its main features are blurred by the fact that a
process of social transition interferes with, and is in turn interfered with
by, another process of transition which—since it is hardly possible,
international relations being what they are, to speak of a transition from a
war economy to a peace economy—had better be called a process of
readjustment under conditions of suppressed inflation. Although distinct in
logic, these two processes are too closely interwoven to admit of separate
treatment. But we shall cut the Gordian knot and separate them all the
same. We can do so with a relatively easy conscience because a modern
conservative government, should the next elections produce one, will also
have to manage readjustment in the given situation and in a society in
which the labor interest dominates and the free-enterprise “beacon light is
quenched in smoke.” In other words: if the labor government should be
replaced by a conservative one—a question Which I cannot claim any
competence to answer—this would presumably make much less difference
than ardent partisans profess to believe except of course that nationalization
would not be carried further.
2. Let us then glance for a moment at that component of England’s
economic policy of the last two years which will bear interpretation as
Preface to the Third Edition, 1946416
“socialist policy before the act” in the sense assigned to this phrase in
Section IV of Chapter XIX. The reader will observe that so far the labor
government has kept well within the program of nationalization there
outlined and that, as regards the most controversial point of this
program—namely point 6: socialization of the steel industry—it has with
remarkable moderation deferred definitive action until after the next
elections. I readily admit that there is room for honest difference of
opinion as to whether or not this socialization or nationalization program
should be called socialist at all. But I am positive that nothing else that
has been actually done can be so called. For most of the “planning” that
has been actually done or suggested has nothing specifically socialist
about it unless we adopt a definition of socialism that is much too wide
to be of any analytic use. Some of the planning schemes and especially
some of the research work done in order to implement them do, of
course, point in the socialist direction, but a long time will elapse before
income accounting and input and output analysis—both of which are
farther advanced in the United States than they are in England—can be
expected to bear consumable socialist fruits.
More important, however, is another aspect of the situation. Of all the things
that have happened in England during the last two years nothing has struck
me more vividly than has the weakness of the resistance that has been offered
to advance along the socialist line. The conservative opposition in Parliament
has kept strictly within the bounds of ordinary parliamentary routine and less
heat has been generated by the issue of social reconstruction than by several
relatively secondary issues of the past such as free trade, Ireland, and the
people’s budget. Both in Parliament and in the country the important sector
of the conservative party which envisages questions of social reconstruction
with perfect equanimity has gained ground. The conservative press has, of
course, proffered its criticisms; it has argued, expostulated, ridiculed as it had
done many times before, but not more so. A critical literature of books and
pamphlets has poured forth as on previous occasions when major issues were
under discussion, but if it occurred to a statistically-minded observer to
measure the importance of issues by the number of volumes or pages produced
by the “No’s,” he could not possibly rate the importance of the socialist issue
very highly. This is not the manner in which a strong nation reacts to attack
upon principles to which it is firmly attached. I infer that the principle of free
enterprise is no longer among them. Socialism has ceased to be resisted with
moral passion. It has become a matter to be discussed in terms of utilitarian
arguments. There are individualist diehards, of course, but they do not seem
to evoke sufficient support to count politically. And this is the writing on the
wall—proof that the ethos of capitalism is gone.
Preface to the Third Edition, 1946 417
3. This situation seems to me to bear out my diagnosis of 1942 and to
verify, so far as verification is possible in such matters, the arguments by
which it was arrived at. I have read the brilliant book by my eminent
colleague, Professor Jewkes, with respect and admiration, 1 but I have to
confess that my sincere wish to be converted has not been fulfilled. Professor
Jewkes’s very approach to the problem—an approach that bears much more
closely upon the vexations incident to the policy of readjustment than it does
upon the issues of socialism—might even be added to the accumulating
evidence in favour of the thesis of this book.
The possibility of settling the question whether to socialize or not by
means of the apparatus of parliamentary democracy has been established,
and so has been the particular method congenial to this political system, viz.,
the method of piecemeal socialization. The beginnings made may not amount
to more than this and may be indicative of nothing but a long-time trend.
Nevertheless they seem to show clearly what we are to understand not only
by democratic socialization, but also by democratic socialism. They show
that socialism and democracy may be compatible provided the latter be
defined as it has been in Chapter XXII of this book. In Chapter XXIII it has
been pointed out that the principle of political democracy—the principle that
governments should emerge from competitive struggles for votes—does, to
some extent, guarantee freedom of speech and freedom of the Press, but that,
for the rest, democracy has nothing to do with “freedoms.” In particular, as
regards the “freedoms” with which the economist is concerned, the freedom
of investment, the freedom of consumers’ choice, and the freedom of
occupational choice, we have now interesting experimental material before
us that goes to show that these “freedoms” may be restricted quite as much
as, and in some respects more than, socialist governments are likely to
require under normal conditions. The freedom of private investment, under
the conditions of modern taxation, has lost the better part of its meaning in
any case; but we also see how investments may be transferred—whatever we,
as individuals, may think of the results—from the private to the public
sphere. The freedom of consumers’ choice, in a socialist community working
under normal conditions, could be much greater than it is now; but in
addition we see that the malleability of tastes is greater than observers used
to believe, for people do not resent restrictions to the point of active
1 John Jewkes, Ordeal by Planning, 1948. With due gratitude for his courteous criticisms
of my argument, I must confess that I do not in all points recognize my own views in the views
criticized. For instance, I should much prefer to say that the entrepreneurial function, owing to
the steady expansion of the range of the calculable, is bound to become obsolescent rather than
that it is actually obsolete anywhere by now. Nor did I intend to deny that there is still room
for military leadership. Only this leadership does not mean quite what it did mean when
Napoleon, bullets whistling around him, stood at the bridge at Arcole.
Preface to the Third Edition, 1946418
resistance even though the necessity of actual restrictions is not evident to
everyone. Similarly, restrictions upon occupational choices will normally not
have to amount to “compulsion” except in a relatively small minority of
cases, especially if the list of admissible choices be rationally coupled with
a list of differential rewards; and we see that people properly conditioned
to accept governmental “directions,” do not mind them greatly.
Let me repeat once more, though it should not be necessary to do so:
these are inferences from facts that could be fully established but in no
sense expressions of my personal preferences. Personally, I prefer other
cultural patterns.
4. As already indicated, criticism of the economic policy of the labor
government is being directed primarily against its management of the
“process of readjustment under conditions of suppressed inflation.” The
government and the bureaucracy have indeed supplied plenty of ammunition
for use against themselves by a torrent of detailed regulations about the
admissible circumference of green onions and similar matters, by ill-
considered administrative decisions, and by official pronouncements that are
easy to ridicule. They have suppressed many activities, entrepreneurial and
other, that might have improved the country’s economic situation. But they
have also avoided postwar readjustment by catastrophe and carried labor
through critical years, without unemployment, on a rising level of real
income. And, if this be the only recognized aim of economic policy as it
seems to be with many economists, it is as possible to speak of success as
it is, from several other standpoints, to speak of failure. It should be added
that this has not been accomplished, as it might have been, by means of
complete diregard of the future: the large amount of public investment that
has been carried out, may be open to criticism as regards the individual
items; but the fact remains that the necessity of rejuvenating the nation’s
economic apparatus has not been neglected in spite of all the protests against
excessive investment that have been voiced by many people, some eminent
economists among them. However, we are concerned with one question only.
It is this: how will the gradual elimination, within the period of the Marshall
aid, of the untenable features of the situation affect the prognosis for our
issue, socialism vs. capitalism? Or in other words: since the solution that
straight socialism might have to offer is obviously not practical politics, and
since in consequence the solution has to be looked for in the opposite
direction, will socialism, in England and elsewhere, suffer a setback and will
the system of private enterprise take on another lease of life?
I do not think that this question is very difficult to answer. Short of
another world war there will be a setback but not a serious or prolonged one.
Private enterprise will regain some of the ground that it has lost but not very
Preface to the Third Edition, 1946 419
much. Fundamentally, the social situation will remain what it is and there is
little likelihood that the shackles upon private enterprise will be removed
sufficiently to allow it to work according to design. The argument that leads
to this conclusion will be outlined in the two remaining sections of this
Preface. It applies to England only. As should be obvious, diagnosis and
prognosis are different for the United States. The pious wish that some
European economists seem to harbor, viz., that there will be a spectacular
breakdown in the latter country—other than a readjustment crisis—and that
this breakdown will mean the coup de grâce to capitalism is not likely to
be fulfilled, whatever American politics may do to the vast possibilities that
unmistakably loom in the immediate future.
5. Among the untenable features of the English situation I do not include
rationing and the detailed regulations of both consumers’ and producers’
behavior. These are but a method for suppressing the effects of inflation and
will disappear when they have served their purpose: in spots they are
disappearing already. But the state of suppressed inflation is itself a
consequence of more fundamentaal difficulties and, but for these, could have
been readily dealt with by well-known traditional remedies such as a budget
surplus, reinforced by special taxation in order to reduce the volume of
redundant purchasing power, and the appropriate credit policy. These means
are actually being used now—not without success—although, in the given
circumstances, they cannot be used to full effect because no great surplus is
possible so long as the food subsidies remain what they are, because the
possibilities of taxation, so far as the higher income brackets are concerned,
are exhausted—in England there are no longer any people who are “rich after
taxes”—and because a higher interest rate meets with apparently invincible
resistance. But the basic difficulty is excess consumption, that is, a real wage
bill plus the real cost of social services which are, on the one hand,
incompatible with the other conditions of the English economy at its present
level of productivity and, on the other hand, the obstacles that prevent it from
rising to a higher level. Usually, the problem is formulated in another and
less unpalatable manner. It is England’s international balance of payment
which is being made the one untenable feature in the picture of her economic
situation so that the goal to be attained within the period of the Marshall aid
appears to be an export surplus that will reinsert her into the world’s
economy and assure effective interchangeability between the pound and the
dollar. This way of putting the problem is not erroneous. The error consists
in believing that it spells out a diagnosis that differs from ours. For in order
to reach that goal and to stay there without either foreign help or internal
pressure it is necessary to normalize England’s domestic situation, as a little
reflection and quite elementary economics suffice to show. Something may
Preface to the Third Edition, 1946420
indeed be gained by more or less mercantilist exploitation of the strong
points in England’s international position and by regulative import and
export policies. Eventually, when the goal comes in sight, devaluation of the
pound may help over the last steps towards it. But the fundamental condition
for durable success is adjustment of her economic process in such a way as
to make it once more produce, along with the goods for her domestic
consumption and the goods and services that are to pay for her imports, a
genuine net surplus for investment at home and abroad. This cannot be
accomplished without a temporary decrease of consumption and a permanent
increase of production; and these in turn cannot be brought about without
an unpopular reduction in public expenditure and a still more unpopular shift
of the burden of taxation.
6. On weighing the implications of this, the reader will have no difficulty
in realizing the magnitude of the political problem involved. Whatever is to
be achieved will have to be achieved by difficult manœuvering at an
indefinite number of points. It seems reasonable to expect that nowhere will
success go beyond the absolute minimum because things being what they
are every move will bear interpretation as an uncompensated sacrifice of
some vested interest of labor. And absolute minima are not enough in order
to reconstruct free-enterprise society and to allow it to show what it can do.
If proof of this were needed, the experience of the 1920’s would suffice to
provide it. Therefore, we cannot expect a break in social trends. A breathing
spell for private enterprise is not unlikely to occur, not only under a
conservative but also under a labor government. But if it occur at all this will
be much more because of the illogical association of socialist policies with
postwar vicissitudes than because of aversion, whether logically defensible
or not, from these socialist policies themselves.

THE MARCH IN.TO SOCIALISM 1
I N ORDER to minimize the danger of misunderstandings that is ever
present in discussions on topics such as the one of this session, I want first
of all to settle a few preliminary points before taking up my subject which
is the relevance, for the economic future of this country, of the present state
of inflationary pressure.
1. For the purposes of this paper, I define (centralist) socialism as that
organization of society in which the means of production are controlled,
and the decisions on how and what to produce and on who is to get what,
are made by public authority instead of by privatelyowned and privately-
managed firms. All that we mean by the March into Socialism is, therefore,
the migration of people’s economic affairs from the private into the public
sphere. Observe that, though both socialists and antisocialists have of
course ideas of their own on the subject, it is hardly possible to visualize
a socialist society in this sense without a huge bureaucratic apparatus that
manages the productive and distributive process and in turn may or may
not be controlled by organs of political democracy such as we have
today—a parliament or congress and a set of political officers who depend
for their position upon the results of a competitive struggle for votes.
Therefore we may equate the march into socialism to a conquest of private
industry and trade by the state. The apparent paradox that this very same
process is described by classic socialist doctrine as the “withering away of
the state” is easily resolved if we take account of the Marxist theory of
government. Observe further that socialism does not exclude decentralized
decision-making in the administrative sense—just as the central
management of an army does not deny all initiative to commanders of
subgroups. And observe, finally, that socialism in our sense does not
1 Joseph Schumpeter delivered his address, “The March into Socialism,” before the
American Economic Association in New York on December 30, 1949, from notes and not from
a prepared manuscript. He was writing up these notes for the Proceedings and had all but
finished his paper the evening before his death. Hé expected to complete it the next day (January
8, 1950) before leaving for Chicago to deliver the Walgreen Foundation Lectures. This paper
is a first draft but carefully written in his own hand as were all his writings; there was no
opportunity for him to make minor corrections or to write the concluding paragraphs. The
corrections which consist largely in supplying punctuation or an occasional missing word have
been kept to a minimum. The brief concluding paragraphs have been supplied by his wife from
notes and memory.

The March into Socialism422
necessarily—that is, by logical necessity—exclude the use of competitive
mechanisms as we see, e.g., from the Lange-Lerner model. Freedom of
consumers’ choice and of choice of occupation may, but need not
necessarily, be restricted in socialist societies.
2. I do not advocate socialism. Nor have I any intention of discussing
its desirability or undesirability, whatever this may mean. More important
is it, however, to make it quite clear that I do not “prophesy” or predict it.
Any prediction is extrascientific prophecy that attempts to do more than
to diagnose observable tendencies and to state what results would be, if
these tendencies should work themselves out according to their logic. In
itself, this does not amount to prognosis or prediction because factors
external to the chosen range of observation may intervene to prevent that
consummation; because, with phenomena so far removed as social
phenomena are from the comfortable situation that astronomers have the
good fortune of facing, observable tendencies, even if allowed to work
themselves out, may be compatible with more than one outcome; and
because existing tendencies, battling with resistances, may fail to work
themselves out completely and may eventually “stick” at some halfway
house. Let us illustrate this point by point.
First, no competent—and, of course, sufficiently detached—observer of
Russia in the Stolypin era could have diagnosed the presence of any tendency
toward anything at all like the Lenin system or, in fact, anything but rapid
economic evolution and a lagged adaptation of institutions to the results of
that evolution. It was a war and the consequent military and administrative
breakdown which produced the Bolshevist regime and no amount of
unscientific determinism avails against this fact. Second, for the sake of
brevity, I speak of centralist socialism only because it holds a place of honor
in the discussion. But other possibilities should not be neglected. Familiar
facts of our own trade-union practice suggest that a development towards
some form of guild socialism is not entirely off the cards. And other familiar
facts suggest that observable tendencies, or some of them, may be compatible
with forms of social reorganization that are not socialist at all, at least not
in the sense which has been adopted for this paper. For instance, a
reorganization of society on the lines of the encyclical Quadragesimo anno,
though presumably possible only in Catholic societies or in societies where
the position of the Catholic Church is sufficiently strong, no doubt provides
an alternative to socialism that would avoid the “omnipotent state.” Third,
most observable tendencies of any kind stop short of complete achievement.
Thus, a socialist regime in this country would have to be bold indeed if it
ever thought of touching the subsidized independence of the farmer. Even
the position of the “small businessman” might prove too strong for

The March into Socialism 423
bureaucracy to conquer, and a large fringe may therefore be covered
indefinitely by compromise arrangements.

Still more important is something else, however. As economic cares
migrate from the private to the public sphere, many urges that favor this
migration become satisfied, wholly or partly, so that the tendency may lose
momentum. Some economists will add that any gradual movement towards
a centrally-planned economy offers opportunity for unfavorable
developments to be experienced which may act as brakes. I have no time to
explain the reasons why I do not rate either possibility very highly and why,
in particular, results that are felt to be unfavorable by sufficiently important
groups are more likely to exert a propelling, than they are to exert a
restraining, influence—that is, that the remedy for unsuccessful socialization
which will suggest itself, will be not less but more socialization. But for our
purpose it is essential to notice that most of the arguments that are framed
in order to arrive at a result favorable to the survival of the private-enterprise
economy do not really deny the existence of a tendency toward socialism in
our sense, but only deny that it will work itself out completely. Since nobody
can dispute this possibility, there is danger that the controversy will resolve
itself into a battle of words, especially in the United States where mere words
count for so much, where the term Socialism is not popular except with some
relatively small minority groups, and where many people who like the thing
at the same time dislike the word and prefer to substitute another, e.g.,
Liberalism. 2 Hence brief attempt at classification seems to be indicated.
3. The reasons for believing that the capitalist order tends to destroy itself
and that centralist socialism is—with the qualifications mentioned above—
a likely heir apparent I have explained elsewhere. Briefly and superficially,
these reasons may be summed up under four heads. First, the very success
of the business class in developing the productive powers of this country and
the very fact that this success has created a new standard of life for all classes
has paradoxically undermined the social and political position of the same
business class whose economic function, though not obsolete, tends to
become obsolescent and amenable to bureaucratization. Second, capitalist
activity, being essentially “rational,” tends to spread rational habits of mind
and to destroy those loyalties and those habits of super- and subordination
that are nevertheless essential for the efficient working of the institutionalized
leadership of the producing plant: no social system can work which is based
exclusively upon a network of free contracts between (legally) equal
contracting parties and in which everyone is supposed to be guided by
nothing except his own (short-run) utilitarian ends. Third, the concentration
2 For obvious reasons, this is still more the case with the term Communism which, barring
the Russian angle, should be used synonymously with Socialism.
The March into Socialism424

of the business class on the tasks of the factory and the office was
instrumental in creating a political system and an intellectual class, the
structure and interests of which developed an attitude of independence from,
and eventually of hostility to, the interests of large-scale business. The latter
is becoming increasingly incapable of defending itself against raids that are,
in the short run, highly profitable to other classes. Fourth, in consequence
of all this, the scheme of values of capitalist society, though causally related
to its economic success, is losing its hold not only upon the public mind but
also upon the “capitalist” stratum itself. Little time, though more than I have,
would be needed to show how modern drives for security, equality, and
regulation (economic engineering) may be explained on these lines.
The best method of satisfying ourselves as to how far this process of
disintegration of capitalist society has gone is to observe the extent to which
its implications are being taken for granted both by the business class itself
and by the large number of economists who feel themselves to be opposed to
(one hundred per cent) socialism and are in the habit of denying the existence
of any tendency toward it. To speak of the latter only, they accept not only
unquestioningly but also approvingly: (1) the various stabilization policies
which are to prevent recessions or at least depressions, that is, a large amount
of public management of business situations even if not the principle of full
employment; (2) the “desirability of greater equality of incomes,” rarely
defining how far short of absolute equality they are prepared to go, and in
connection with this the principle of redistribu tive taxation; (3) a rich
assortment of regulative measures, frequently rationalized by antitrust slogans,
as regards prices; (4) public control, though within a wide range of variation,
over the labor and the money market; (5) indefinite extension of the sphere
of wants that are, now or eventually, to be satisfied by public enterprise, either
gratis or on some post-office principle; and (6) of course all types of security
legislation. I believe that there is a mountain in Switzerland on which
congresses of economists have been held which express disapproval of all or
most of these things. But these anathemata have not even provoked attack.
It would spell complete misunderstanding of my argument if you thought
that I “disapprove” or wish to criticize any of these policies. Nor am I one of
those who label all or some of them “socialist.” Some were espoused, even in
the eighteenth century, by conservative or even autocratic rulers; others have
been on the programs of conservative parties and have been carried by them
long before New Deal days. All I wish to emphasize is the fact that we have
traveled far indeed from the principles of laissez-faire capitalism and the
further fact that it is possible so to develop and regulate capitalist institutions
as to condition the working of private enterprise in a manner that differs but
little from genuinely socialist planning. The economists I have in mind no
The March into Socialism 425
doubt emphasize the differences they think likely to persist. They are not all
agreed as to the precise location of their movable halfway house. But they all
realize what Marx failed to realize: on the one hand, the vast productive
possibilities of the capitalist engine that promise indefinitely higher mass
standards of life, supplemented by gratis services without complete
“expropriation of the expropriators”; on the other hand, the extent to which
capitalist interests can in fact be expropriated without bringing the economic
engine to a standstill and the extent to which this engine may be made to run
in the labor interest. Having discovered this possibility of a laborist capitalism
they go on to conclude that this capitalism may survive indefinitely, at least
under certain favorable conditions. This may be so, but it does not amount to
a denial of my thesis. Capitalism does not merely mean that the housewife may
influence production by her choice between peas and beans; or that the
youngster may choose whether he wants to work in a factory or on a farm; or
that plant managers have some voice in deciding what and how to produce: it
means a scheme of values, an attitude toward life, a civilization—the
civilization of inequality and of the family fortune. This civilization is rapidly
passing away, however. Let us rejoice or else lament the fact as much as
everyone of us likes; but do not let us shut our eyes to it.
One genuine problem remains. The diagnoses that support implications
which are favorable to the survival of laborism all lean heavily on
extrapolations of the present spectacular development of society’s productive
powers. But there is an element of question-begging in this. Past achievement
was the achievement of a more or less unfettered capitalism. It cannot be
assumed without further consideration that laborism will continue to perform
like this. We need not accept the stagnationist thesis as it stands in order to
be disturbed by the possibility that this thesis may come true after all if the
private-enterprise system is permanently burdened and “regulated” beyond
its powers of endurance. In this case, an outright socialist solution may
impose itself even on the enemies of socialism as the lesser evil.
II
The transformation of social orders into one another is an incessant process
but, in itself, a very slow one. To an observer who studies a moderate span
of “quiet” time, it may well seem as if the social framework he beholds
did not change at all. Moreover, the process often suffers setbacks which,
considered by themselves, may suggest to him the presence of an opposite
tendency. But at times we also observe accelerations and one of the most
obvious causes of these are major wars. In the past, successful wars may
have added to the prestige of the ruling stratum, and to the strength of the
institutional framework with which this stratum was associated. This is no
The March into Socialism426
longer so under modern conditions. The First World War of our own epoch
affected the social situation in the United States but little because the war
effort was neither exhausting enough nor prolonged enough to leave a
permanent mark. But in Europe it was different. In the vanquished
countries where the social framework caught fire, the latent tendency
toward socialist reconstruction proved its existence by emerging to the
surface and, for a brief period, carrying everything before it. Still more
significant is the fact that something similar also happened, though of
course on a much reduced scale, in the victorious countries. In France the
bourgeois republic ceased to function as it had functioned before 1914. In
England, a labor party that was not yet socialist but was influenced by a
socialist wing, rose not indeed to power but at least to office. And in both
countries, the attitude of the political sector to the privateenterprise system
quietly underwent a fundamental change.
Given a pre-existing tendency toward the socialist goal, this is easy to
understand. Although voices that called for a continuation of the policies
established during the years of the war economy did not elicit much response
and although, for a time, public resentment of war regulations blocked
further advance on the same lines, no return to prewar policies proved
possible even where it was attempted. This has been strikingly verified by
England’s gold policy and its ultimate failure: in a world that was no longer
the world of free enterprise, the gold standard—the naughty child that keeps
on telling unpleasant truths—refused to work
The world crisis and the Second World War were additional “accelerators”
and, this time, they asserted themselves also in the United States. They created
situations that were felt, rightly or wrongly, to be beyond the remedies that
would have recommended themselves to the men of the free-enterprise age.
The business class itself, afraid of the “adjustments” that application of those
remedies would have required, accepted—though of course grumbling all the
time—gadgets of regulation that might prevent the recurrence of the
experiences of 1929–1933, and later on others that might prevent a postwar
crisis such as that of 1921. It has learned much and unlearned still more during
the last quarter of a century. Also, it has accepted new fiscal burdens, a mere
fraction of which it would have felt to be unbearable fifty years ago—as
would, by the way, all the leading economists of that time. And it does not
matter whether the business class accepts this new situation or not. The power
of labor is almost strong enough in itself—and amply so in alliance with the
other groups that have in fact, if not in words, renounced allegiance to the
scheme of values of the private-profit economy—to prevent any reversal which
goes beyond an occasional scaling off of rough edges.
Let me repeat: I do not hold for a moment that any mere “events,” even
The March into Socialism 427
events of the importance of “total wars,” or the political situations created
thereby, or any attitudes or feelings entertained by individuals or groups on
the subject of these situations, dominate the long-run contours of social
history—these are a matter of much deeper forces. But I do hold that such
events and the situations created thereby may remove obstacles from the path
of the more fundamental tendencies, obstacles that would otherwise slow up
the pace of social evolution. Observe that this does not necessarily constitute
a reason for a serious socialist to welcome such events. Evolution toward
socialism would be slower in their absence but also steadier. Setbacks and the
emergence of unmanageable situations would be less likely. Co-ordination of
developments in the various sectors of national life would be more perfect. For,
just as the existence of an efficient opposition is a requirement for the orderly
functioning of democratic government, so the existence of economic forces
that resist institutional change may be necessary in order to keep the speed of
this change within the limits of safety.
Now, one of the most powerful factors that make for acceleration of social
change is inflation. With so many authorities telling us that nothing undermines
the framework of a society as does inflation, it is hardly necessary to dwell
upon this proposition. If we accept it, then it follows from what I have just
said that from all imaginable standpoints, the standpoint of irresponsible
revolutionaries alone excepted, it is of prime importance after a war so to
adjust a country’s economic process as to stop it from producing further
inflation. But it is clear at the same time that this is an extremely difficult thing
to do in a world where everybody is afraid of the short-run consequences of
such a policy and where some of the adjustments required—especially a rise
in many previously controlled prices without a rise in money wage rates—is
not “politically possible” at all. 3 The course that was the obvious one to take
under the circumstances and that was actually followed after 1945—among
mutual recriminations but still with a good deal of common consent—was to
mitigate transitional difficulties by a dose of controlled peacetime inflation that
was made more effective by the continuance of a high level of expenditure on
the armed services and by the policy of European aid. Substantially, all this
served its purpose and, as it became evident to most people, though not to all
economists, that a period of vigorous economic development, entailing vast
investment requirements was at hand, the hope that major disturbances would
be avoided and that the economy of the United States would expand on a
slowly rising price level was, for a time, not altogether unreasonable—
whatever, short of another world war, might happen abroad.
Considerations of this type fail however to take into account an ominous fact.
3 The alternative course, scaling down other prices and money wages, is not only still less
“politically possible” but also much more difficult to do without causing a serious depression.
The March into Socialism428
At a high level of employment (we seem, at long last, to be abandoning full-
employment slogans) whether “natural” or enforced by high-employment
policies, wage demands or other demands that increase the money cost of
employing labor become both inevitable and inflationary. They become
inevitable because high-level employment removes the only reason why they
should not be raised. And they become inflationary because, with high utilization
of resources, borrowing from banks and upward revision of prices provides a
perfectly easy method of satisfying them. Though bargaining is still with
individual trade unions, the movement is really a general one so that we are
drifting into the Keynesian situation in which the money wage rate no longer
affects output and employment but only the value of the monetary unit. The
situations of trade union leadership and of government being what they are, there
is nothing to stop this mechanism which—barring exceptions that are due to the
particular situations of certain firms—spells perennial inflationary pressure.
Rising demands upon the Treasury and our hyperprogressive methods of taxation
aggravate this condition, of course, but they have not created it.
There should be no need to state that breaks in prices such as have
occurred and will occur again prove nothing against the presence of
inflationary pressure. Even apart from the postwar movements of agricultural
prices and other self-explanatory cases, such breaks occur characteristically
in the course of every inflation—as could be illustrated nicely from the
German inflation that followed upon the First World War. People who are
“caught” then cry out about deflation, and so do those fellow economists of
ours who have deflationary prognoses to live down and who, in any case,
seem incapable of foreseeing anything but deflation. But it is a compliment,
the more sincere because unintentional, to the productive powers of
American industry that doubts are at all possible as to whether our society
is menaced by inflation or deflation.
III
A state of perennial inflationary pressure will have, qualitatively, all the
effects of weakening the social framework of society and of strengthening
subversive tendencies (however carefully wrapped up in “liberal” phrases)
that every competent economist is in the habit of attributing to more
spectacular inflations. But this is not all. In addition some of the standard
remedies for such situations will not mitigate, and may even aggravate, the
present one. It seems to me that this is not being fully understood. Let us
therefore, in desperate brevity, discuss three types of such remedies.
1. The most orthodox of all measures for the control of inflation is action
upon the volume of borrowing through interest rates or credit rationing and
the like. I fully understand of course that money rates must be freed from the
The March into Socialism 429
grip of cheap-money policies if normalcy in the sense of a free-enterprise
economy is to be attained and that for everyone who desires return to such
normalcy, the liberation—or reconstruction—of a free money market must be
a point of prime importance. But this does not alter the fact that a restrictive
credit policy would at present produce consequences quite different from those
that the old theory of credit policy would lead us to expect. Accepting the latter
without any qualification—for argument’s sake—we cannot help observing
that it was to apply to a world in which everything was entirely flexible, and
which was not afraid of what I may term, remedial recessions. In such a world,
an increase in interest rates was supposed to reduce the volume of operations,
money wages, and employment. Surely these effects would not materialize at
present and, if they did, they would immediately provoke government action
to neutralize them. In other words, credit restrictions would at present achieve
little beyond increasing the difficulties of business. Even restrictions of
consumers’ credit would have this effect to some extent, though something
could no doubt be done in this field.
2. Similar difficulties stand in the way of controlling inflation by means
of increasing taxation—a no less orthodox remedy but one which enjoys a
popularity with modern economists that is denied to credit restriction. It is
quite true that something might be accomplished by increasing taxes on
consumption. In an inflationary situation this would even be good
Keynesianism. But if it is the corporation tax and the higher-bracket income
tax which are to be increased, the effect upon inflationary pressure would
be small at best and might even be negative. For if the present rate of
industrial progress is to continue and therefore the present rate of
obsolescence of equipment is to continue also, increasing resort would have
to be taken to inflationary bank credit in order to make up for the decrease
in the available noninflationary means of finance. Alternatively, a decrease
in those rates of progress and of obsolescence, would indeed decrease
inflationary pressure for the moment but increase it in the long run.4
3. The third household remedy consists in direct controls—pricefixing,
priorities and the like (including subsidies). Why they are so popular with
certain sectors of public opinion is a question that need not detain us. For
the bureaucracy, in particular, their reintroduction would spell reconquest of
4 I have no difficulty in understanding why this argument does not impress our radical friends.
But I confess that I find it difficult to understand the position of some excellent economists who
are quite above any suspicion that they would welcome the failure of our industrial engine to work
on successfully and who nevertheless list reduction in industrial investment among the acceptable
means for counteracting inflation, both in this country and in England. Incidentally, it should be
noticed that the opinion of some conservative stalwarts that high and highly progressive taxation
might promote, and that reductions in taxation (at the right spots) might decrease, inflationary
dangers does not necessarily merit all the sneers it usually gets.
The March into Socialism430
ground that has been lost; for the trade unions it would spell a decisive
advantage in the campaign for the conquest of the profit item; for business
it would mean the loss of the line of retreat that is open to it so long as most,
if not all, attacks upon it can be, partly if not wholly, parried by price
adjustments. Or, at least, it would make this retreat dependent upon
government permission which there is no reason to believe would be granted
for purposes of securing means for improving the productive engine. In other
words, price control may result in a surrender of private enterprise to public
authority, that is, in a big stride toward the perfectly planned economy.
[At this point Joseph Schumpeter stopped in the writing up of his notes.
Those who heard the address will remember that at the end there was little
time, and he summed up very briefly, going back to his opening remarks
on the relevance, for the economic future of this country, of the present
state of inflationary pressure, under existing political conditions. Some of
the points touched upon with “desperate brevity” may be found developed
at greater length in the second American edition or in the third English
edition of Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy and in an article, “There
is Still Time to Stop Inflation,” which appeared in the Nation’s Business
for June, 1948.
The following paragraphs are reconstructed from memory and from the
notes used for the address.]
I do not pretend to prophesy; I merely recognize the facts and point out
the tendencies which those facts indicate.
Perennial inflationary pressure can play an important part in the
eventual conquest of the private-enterprise system by the bureaucracy—
the resultant frictions and deadlocks being attributed to private enterprise
and used as arguments for further restrictions and regulations. I do not
say that any group follows this line with conscious purpose, but purposes
are never wholly conscious. A situation may well emerge in which most
people will consider complete planning as the smallest of possible evils.
They will certainly not call it Socialism or Communism, and presumably
they will make some exceptions for the farmer, the retailer and the small
producer; under these circumstances, capitalism (the free-enterprise
system) as a scheme of values, a way of life, and a civilization may not
be worth bothering about.
Whether the American genius for mass production, on whose past
performance all optimism for this way of life rests, is up to this test, I dare
not affirm; nor do I dare to affirm that the policies responsible for this
situation might be reversed.
The March into Socialism 431
Marx was wrong in his diagnosis of the manner in which capitalist
society would break down; he was not wrong in the prediction that it would
break down eventually. The Stagnationists are wrong in their diagnosis of
the reasons why the capitalist process should stagnate; they may still turn
out to be right in their prognosis that it will stagnate—with sufficient help
from the public sector. 5
