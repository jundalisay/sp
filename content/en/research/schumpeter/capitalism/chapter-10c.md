2. Next as to the opening up of new lands—that unique opportunity for
investment which cannot ever recur. Even if, for the sake of argument, we
grant that humanity’s geographical frontier is closed for good—which is not
in itself very obvious in view of the fact that at present there are deserts
where once there were fields and populous cities—and even if we further
grant that nothing will ever contribute to human welfare as much as did the
foodstuffs and raw materials from those new lands—which is more
plausible—it does not follow that total output per head must therefore
decline, or increase at a smaller rate, during the next half-century. 

This would
indeed have to be expected if the lands that in the nineteenth century entered the capitalist sphere had been exploited in the sense that diminishing returns
would now be due to assert themselves. This however is not the case and,
as was just pointed out, the decreasing rate of increase in population removes
from the range of practical considerations the idea that nature’s response to
human effort either already is or must soon become less generous than it has
been. 

Technological progress effectively turned the tables on any such
tendency, and it is one of the safest predictions that in the calculable future
we shall live in an embarras de richesse of both foodstuffs and raw materials,
giving all the rein to expansion of total output that we shall know what to
do with. This applies to mineral resources as well.

<!-- 6 Forecasts of future populations, from those of the seventeenth century on, were
practically always wrong. For this, however, there is some excuse. There may be even for
Malthus’s doctrine. But I cannot see any excuse for its survival. In the second half of the
nineteenth century it should have been clear to anyone that the only valuable things about
Malthus’s law of population are its qualifications. The first decade of this century definitely
showed that it was a bogey. But no less an authority than Mr. Keynes attempted to revitalise
it in the post-war period! And as late as 1925, Mr. H.Wright in his book on Population
spoke of “wasting the gains of civilization on a mere increase in numbers.” Will economics
never come of age? -->

There remains another possibility. Though the current output per head
of foodstuffs and raw materials need not suffer and may even increase, the
vast opportunities for enterprise and hence for investment that were
afforded by the task of developing the new countries seem to have vanished
with its completion and all sorts of difficulties are being predicted from
the resulting reduction of outlets for savings. We will assume again for the
sake of argument that those countries actually are developed for good and
that savings, failing to adapt themselves to a reduction of outlets, might
cause troubles and wastes unless other outlets open up instead. Both
assumptions are indeed most unrealistic. But there is no necessity for us
to question them because the conclusion as to the future development of
output is contingent upon a third one that is completely gratuitous, viz.,
the absence of other outlets.

This third assumption is simply due to lack of imagination and
exemplifies a mistake that very frequently distorts historical interpretation.
The particular features of a historic process that impress the analyst tend in
his mind to slip into the position of fundamental causes whether they have
a claim to that role or not. For instance, what is usually referred to as the
Rise of Capitalism roughly coincides with the influx of silver from the Potosi
mines and with a political situation in which the expenditure of princes
habitually outran their revenue so that they had to borrow incessantly. Both
facts are obviously relevant in a variety of ways to the economic
developments of those times—even peasants’ revolts and religious upheavals
may without absurdity be linked up with them. The analyst thereupon is apt
to jump to the conclusion that the rise of-the capitalist order of things is
causally connected with them in the sense that without them (and a few other
factors of the same type) the feudal world would have failed to transform
itself into the capitalist one. But this is really another proposition and one
for which there is, on the face of it, no warrant whatsoever. All that can be
averred is that this was the road by which events traveled. It does not follow
that there was no other. In this case, by the way, it cannot even be held that those factors favored capitalist development for though they certainly did do
so in some respects they obviously retarded it in others.

Similarly, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, the opportunities for
enterprise afforded by the new areas to be exploited were certainly unique,
but only in the sense in which all opportunities are. It is gratuitous to assume
not only that the “closing of the frontier” will cause a vacuum but also that
“whatever steps into the vacant place must necessarily be less important in
any of the senses we may choose to give to that word. The conquest of the
air may well be more important than the conquest of India was—we must
not confuse geographical frontiers with economic ones.

The relative positions of countries or regions may
significantly change as one type of investment opportunity is replaced by
another. The smaller a country or region is and the more closely its fortunes
are wedded to one particular element in the productive process, the less
confidence we shall feel as to the future in store for it when that element is
played out. Thus agricultural countries or regions may lose permanently by
the competitive synthetic products (rayon, dyes, synthetic rubber for
instance), and it may be no comfort to them that, if the process be taken as
a whole, there may be net gain in total output.

It is also true that the possible
consequences of this may be much intensified by the division of the
economic world into hostile national spheres. And it is finally true that all
we can assert is that the vanishing of the investment opportunities incident
to the development of new countries—if they are already vanishing—need
not cause a void that would necessarily affect the rate of increase in total
output. We cannot assert that they actually will be replaced by at least
equivalent ones. We may point to the fact that from that development further
developments naturally arise in those same countries or in others; we may
put some trust in the ability of the capitalist engine to find or create ever
new opportunities since it is geared to this very purpose; but such
considerations do not carry us beyond our negative result. And recalling our
reasons for embarking upon the subject, this is quite enough.
