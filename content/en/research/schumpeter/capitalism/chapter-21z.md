III. H UMAN N ATURE I N P OLITICS

It remains to answer our question about the definiteness and independence
of the voter’s will, his powers of observation and interpretation of facts, and
his ability to draw, clearly and promptly, rational inferences from both. This
subject belongs to a chapter of social psychology that might be entitled
Human Nature in Politics. 7
During the second half of the last century, the idea of the human
personality that is a homogeneous unit and the idea of a definite will that is
the prime mover of action have been steadily fading—even before the times
of Théodule Ribot and of Sigmund Freud. In particular, these ideas have
been increasingly discounted in the field of social sciences where the
importance of the extra-rational and irrational element in our behavior has
been receiving more and more attention, witness Pareto’s Mind and Society.
Of the many sources of the evidence that accumulated against the hypothesis
of rationality, I shall mention only two.
The one—in spite of much more careful later work—may still be
associated with the name of Gustave Le Bon, the founder or, at any rate, the
6 Other instances could in fact be adduced from Napoleon’s practice. He was an autocrat
who, whenever his dynastic interests and his foreign policy were not concerned, simply strove
to do what he conceived the people wanted or needed. This is what the advice amounted to
which he gave to Eugène Beauharnais concerning the latter’s administration of northern Italy.
7 This is the title of the frank and charming book by one of the most lovable English radicals
who ever lived, Graham Wallas. In spite of all that has since been written on the subject and
especially in spite of all the detailed case studies that now make it possible to see so much
more clearly, that book may still be recommended as the best introduction to political
psychology. Yet, after having stated with admirable honesty the case against the uncritical
acceptance of the classical doctrine, the author fails to draw the obvious conclusion. This is
all the more remarkable because he rightly insists on the necessity of a scientific attitude of
mind and because he does not fail to take Lord Bryce to task for having, in his book on the
American commonwealth, professed himself “grimly” resolved to see some blue sky in the
midst of clouds of disillusioning facts. Why, so Graham Wallas seems to exclaim, what should
we say of a meteorologist who insisted from the outset that he saw some blue sky? Nevertheless
in the constructive part of his book he takes much the same ground.
The Classical Doctrine of Democracy 257
first effective exponent of the psychology of crowds (psychologie des
foules). 8 By showing up, though overstressing, the realities of human
behavior when under the influence of agglomeration—in particular the
sudden disappearance, in a state of excitement, of moral restraints and
civilized modes of thinking and feeling, the sudden eruption of primitive
impulses, infantilisms and criminal propensities—he made us face gruesome
facts that everybody knew but nobody wished to see and he thereby dealt a
serious blow to the picture of man’s nature which underlies the classical
doctrine of democracy and democratic folklore about revolutions. No doubt
there is much to be said about the narrowness of the factual basis of Le
Bon’s inferences which, for instance, do not fit at all well the normal
behavior of an English or Anglo-American crowd. Critics, especially those
to whom the implications of this branch of social psychology were
uncongenial, did not fail to make the most of its vulnerable points. But on
the other hand it must not be forgotten that the phenomena of crowd
psychology are by no means confined to mobs rioting in the narrow streets
of a Latin town. Every parliament, every committee, every council of war
composed of a dozen generals in their sixties, displays, in however mild a
form, some of those features that stand out so glaringly in the case of the
rabble, in particular a reduced sense of responsibility, a lower level of energy
of thought and greater sensitiveness to non-logical influences. Moreover,
those phenomena are not confined to a crowd in the sense of a physical
agglomeration of many people. Newspaper readers, radio audiences,
members of a party even if not physically gathered together are terribly easy
to work up into a psychological crowd and into a state of frenzy in which
attempt at rational argument only spurs the animal spirits.
The other source of disillusioning evidence that I am going to mention
is a much humbler one—no blood flows from it, only nonsense. Economists,
learning to observe their facts more closely, have begun to discover that, even
in the most ordinary currents of daily life, their consumers do not quite live
up to the idea that the economic textbook used to convey. On the one hand
their wants are nothing like as definite and their actions upon those wants
nothing like as rational and prompt. On the other hand they are so amenable
to the influence of advertising and other methods of persuasion that
producers often seem to dictate to them instead of being directed by them.
The technique of successful advertising is particularly instructive. There is
indeed nearly always some appeal to reason. But mere assertion, often
8 The German term, Massenpsychologie, suggests a warning: the psychology of crowds must
not be confused with the psychology of the masses. The former does not necessarily carry any
class connotation and in itself has nothing to do with a study of the ways of thinking and feeling
of, say, the working class.
Socialism and Democracy258
repeated, counts more than rational argument and so does the direct attack
upon the subconscious which takes the form of attempts to evoke and
crystallize pleasant associations of an entirely extra-rational, very frequently
of a sexual nature.
The conclusion, while obvious, must be drawn with care. In the ordinary
run of often repeated decisions the individual is subject to the salutary and
rationalizing influence of favorable and unfavorable experience. He is also
under the influence of relatively simple and unproblematical motives and
interests which are but occasionally interfered with by excitement.
Historically, the consumers’ desire for shoes may, at least in part, have been
shaped by the action of producers offering attractive footgear and
campaigning for it; yet at any given time it is a genuine want, the definiteness
of which extends beyond “shoes in general” and which prolonged
experimenting clears of much of the irrationalities that may originally have
surrounded it. 9 Moreover, under the stimulus of those simple motives
consumers learn to act upon unbiased expert advice about some things
(houses, motorcars) and themselves become experts in others. It is simply
not true that housewives are easily fooled in the matter of foods, familiar
household articles, wearing apparel. And, as every salesman knows to his
cost, most of them have a way of insisting on the exact article they want.
This of course holds true still more obviously on the producers’ side of the
picture. No doubt, a manufacturer may be indolent, a bad judge of opportunities
or otherwise incompetent; but there is an effective mechanism that will reform
or eliminate him. Again Taylorism rests on the fact that man may perform simple
handicraft operations for thousands of years and yet perform them inefficiently.
But neither the intention to act as rationally as possible nor a steady pressure
toward rationality can seriously be called into question at whatever level of
industrial or commercial activity we choose to look.10
And so it is with most of the decisions of daily life that lie within the little
field which the individual citizen’s mind encompasses with a full sense of
its reality. Roughly, it consists of the things that directly concern himself,
his family, his business dealings, his hobbies, his friends and enemies, his
township or ward, his class, church, trade union or any other social group
9 In the above passage irrationality means failure to act rationally upon a given wish. It does
not refer to the reasonableness of the wish itself in the opinion of the observer. This is important
to note because economists in appraising the extent of consumers’ irrationality sometimes
exaggerate it by confusing the two things. Thus, a factory girl’s finery may seem to a professor
an indication of irrational behavior for which there is no other explanation but the advertiser’s
arts. Actually, it may be all she craves for. If so her expenditure on it may be ideally rational
in the above sense.
10 This level differs of course not only as between epochs and places but also, at a given
time and place, as between different industrial sectors and classes. There is no such thing as a
universal pattern of rationality.
The Classical Doctrine of Democracy 259
of which he is an active member—the things under his personal observation,
the things which are familiar to him independently of what his newspaper
tells him, which he can directly influence or manage and for which he
develops the kind of responsibility that is induced by a direct relation to the
favorable or unfavorable effects of a course of action.
Once more: definiteness and rationality in thought and action 11 are not
guaranteed by this familiarity with men and things or by that sense of reality or
responsibility. Quite a few other conditions which often fail to be fulfilled would
be necessary for that. For instance, generation after generation may suffer from
irrational behavior in matters of hygiene and yet fail to link their sufferings with
their noxious habits. As long as this is not done, objective consequences, however
regular, of course do not produce subjective experience. Thus it proved
unbelievably hard for humanity to realize the relation between infection and
epidemics: the facts pointed to it with what to us seems unmistakable clearness;
yet to the end of the eighteenth century doctors did next to nothing to keep
people afflicted with infectious disease, such as measles or smallpox, from
mixing with other people. And things must be expected to be still worse
whenever there is not only inability but reluctance to recognize causal relations
or when some interest fights against recognizing them.
Nevertheless and in spite of all the qualifications that impose themselves,
there is for everyone, within a much wider horizon, a narrower field—widely
differing in extent as between different groups and individuals and bounded
by a broad zone rather than a sharp line—which is distinguished by a sense
of reality or familiarity or responsibility. And this field harbors relatively
definite individual volitions. These may often strike us as unintelligent,
narrow, egotistical; and it may not be obvious to everyone why, when it
comes to political decisions, we should worship at their shrine, still less why
we should feel bound to count each of them for one and none of them for
more than one. If, however, we do choose to worship we shall at least not
find the shrine empty. 12
11 Rationality of thought and rationality of action are two different things. Rationality
of thought does not always guarantee rationality of action. And the latter may be present
without any conscious deliberation and irrespective of any ability to formulate the rationale
of one’s action correctly. The observer, particularly the observer who uses interview and
questionnaire methods, often overlooks this and hence acquires an exaggerated idea of the
importance of irrationality in behavior. This is another source of those overstatements which
we meet so often.
12 It should be observed that in speaking of definite and genuine volitions I do not mean to
exalt them into ultimate data for all kinds of social analysis. Of course they are themselves
the product of the social process and the social environment. All I mean is that they may serve
as data for the kind of special-purpose analysis which the economist has in mind when he
derives prices from tastes or wants that are “given” at any moment and need not be further
analyzed each time. Similarly we may for our purpose speak of genuine and definite volitions
that at any moment are given independently of attempts to manufacture them, although we
Socialism and Democracy260
Now this comparative definiteness of volition and rationality of behavior
does not suddenly vanish as we move away from those concerns of daily life
in the home and in business which educate and discipline as. In the realm
of public affairs there are sectors that are more within the reach of the
citizen’s mind than others. This is true, first, of local affairs. Even there we
find a reduced power of discerning facts, a reduced preparedness to act upon
them, a reduced sense of responsibility. We all know the man—and a very
good specimen he frequently is—who says that the local administration is
not his business and callously shrugs his shoulders at practices which he
would rather die than suffer in his own office. High-minded citizens in a
hortatory mood who preach the responsibility of the individual voter or
taxpayer invariably discover the fact that this voter does not feel responsible
for what the local politicians do. Still, especially in communities not too big
for personal contacts, local patriotism may be a very important factor in
“making democracy work.” Also, the problems of a town are in many
respects akin to the problems of a manufacturing concern. The man who
understands the latter also understands, to some extent, the former. The
manufacturer, grocer or workman need not step out of his world to have a
rationally defensible view (that may of course be right or wrong) on street
cleaning or town halls.
Second, there are many national issues that concern individuals and groups
so directly and unmistakably as to evoke volitions that are genuine and definite
enough. The most important instance is afforded by issues involving immediate
and personal pecuniary profit to individual voters and groups of voters, such
as direct payments, protective duties, silver policies and so on. Experience that
goes back to antiquity shows that by and large voters react promptly and
rationally to any such chance. But the classical doctrine of democracy
evidently stands to gain little from displays of rationality of this kind. Voters
thereby prove themselves bad and indeed corrupt judges of such issues, 13 and
often they even prove themselves bad judges of their own long-run interests,
recognize that these genuine volitions themselves are the result of environmental influences in
the past, propagandist influences included. This distinction between genuine and manufactured
will (see below) is a difficult one and cannot be applied in all cases and for all purposes. For
our purpose however it is sufficient to point to the obvious common-sense case which can be
made for it.
13 The reason why the Benthamites so completely overlooked this is that they did not
consider the possibilities of mass corruption in modern capitalism. Committing in their political
theory the same error which they committed in their economic theory, they felt no compunction
about postulating that “the people” were the best judges of their own individual interests and
that these must necessarily coincide with the interests of all the people taken together. Of course
this was made easier for them because actually though not intentionally they philosophized in
terms of bourgeois interests which had more to gain from a parsimonious state than from any
direct bribes.
The Classical Doctrine of Democracy 261
for it is only the short-run promise that tells politically and only short-run
rationality that asserts itself effectively.
However, when we move still farther away from the private concerns of
the family and the business office into those regions of national and
international affairs that lack a direct and unmistakable link with those
private concerns, individual volition, command of facts and method of
inference soon cease to fulfill the requirements of the classical doctrine.
What strikes me most of all and seems to me to be the core of the trouble is
the fact that the sense of reality 14 is so completely lost. Normally, the great
political questions take their place in the psychic economy of the typical
citizen with those leisure-hour interests that have not attained the rank of
hobbies, and with the subjects of irresponsible conversation. These things
seem so far off; they are not at all like a business proposition; dangers may
not materialize at all and if they should they may not prove so very serious;
one feels oneself to be moving in a fictitious world.
This reduced sense of reality accounts not only for a reduced sense of
responsibility but also for the absence of effective volition. One has one’s
phrases, of course, and one’s wishes and daydreams and grumbles:
especially, one has one’s likes and dislikes. But ordinarily they do not
amount to what we call a will—the psychic counterpart of purposeful
responsible action. In fact, for the private citizen musing over national affairs
there is no scope for such a will and no task at which it could develop. He
is a member of an unworkable committee, the committee of the whole
nation, and this is why he expends less disciplined effort on mastering a
political problem than he expends on a game of bridge. 15
The reduced sense of responsibility and the absence of effective volition
in turn explain the ordinary citizen’s ignorance and lack of judgment in
matters of domestic and foreign policy which are if anything more shocking
in the case of educated people and of people who are successfully active in
non-political walks of life than it is with uneducated people in humble
stations. Information is plentiful and readily available. But this does not seem
to make any difference. Nor should we wonder at it. We need only compare
a lawyer’s attitude to his brief and the same lawyer’s attitude to the
14 William James’ “pungent sense of reality.” The relevance of this point has been
particularly emphasized by Graham Wallas.
15 It will help to clarify the point if we ask ourselves why so much more intelligence and
clear-headedness show up at a bridge table than in, say, political discussion among non-
politicians. At the bridge table we have a definite task; we have rules that discipline us;
success and failure are clearly defined; and we are prevented from behaving irresponsibly
because every mistake we make will not only immediately tell but also be immediately
allocated to us. These conditions, by their failure to be fulfilled for the political behavior of
the ordinary citizen, show why it is that in politics he lacks all the alertness and the judgment
he may display in his profession.
Socialism and Democracy262
statements of political fact presented in his newspaper in order to see what
is the matter. In the one case the lawyer has qualified for appreciating the
relevance of his facts by years of purposeful labor done under the definite
stimulus of interest in his professional competence; and under a stimulus that
is no less powerful he then bends his acquirements, his intellect, his will to
the contents of the brief. In the other case, he has not taken the trouble to
qualify; he does not care to absorb the information or to apply to it the
canons of criticism he knows so well how to handle; and he is impatient of
long or complicated argument. All of this goes to show that without the
initiative that comes from immediate responsibility, ignorance will persist in
the face of masses of information however complete and correct. It persists
even in the face of the meritorious efforts that are being made to go beyond
presenting information and to teach the use of it by means of lectures,
classes, discussion groups. Results are not zero. But they are small. People
cannot be carried up the ladder.
Thus the typical citizen drops down to a lower level of mental performance
as soon as he enters the political field. He argues and analyzes in a way which
he would readily recognize as infantile within the sphere of his real interests.
He becomes a primitive again. His thinking becomes associative and
affective. 16 And this entails two further consequences of ominous significance.
First, even if there were no political groups trying to influence him, the
typical citizen would in political matters tend to yield to extrarational or
irrational prejudice and impulse. The weakness of the rational processes he
applies to politics and the absence of effective logical control over the results
he arrives at would in themselves suffice to account for that. Moreover,
simply because he is not “all there,” he will relax his usual moral standards
as well and occasionally give in to dark urges which the conditions of private
life help him to repress. But as to the wisdom or rationality of his inferences
and conclusions, it may be just as bad if he gives in to a burst of generous
indignation. This will make it still more difficult for him to see things in their
correct proportions or even to see more than one aspect of one thing at a
time. Hence, if for once he does emerge from his usual vagueness and does
display the definite will postulated by the classical doctrine of democracy,
he is as likely as not to become still more unintelligent and irresponsible than
he usually is. At certain junctures, this may prove fatal to his nation. 17
16 See ch. xii.
17 The importance of such bursts cannot be doubted. But it is possible to doubt their
genuineness. Analysis will show in many instances that they are induced by the action of some
group and do not spontaneously arise from the people. In this case they enter into a (second)
class of phenomena which we are about to deal with. Personally, I do believe that genuine
instances exist. But I cannot be sure that more thorough analysis would not reveal some psycho-
technical effort at the bottom of them.
The Classical Doctrine of Democracy 263
Second, however, the weaker the logical element in the processes of the
public mind and the more complete the absence of rational criticism and of
the rationalizing influence of personal experience and responsibility, the
greater are the opportunities for groups with an ax to grind. These groups
may consist of professional politicians or of exponents of an economic
interest or of idealists of one kind or another or of people simply interested
in staging and managing political shows. The sociology of such groups is
immaterial to the argument in hand. The only point that matters here is that,
Human Nature in Politics being what it is, they are able to fashion and,
within very wide limits, even to create the will of the people. What we are
confronted with in the analysis of political processes is largely not a genuine
but a manufactured will. And often this artefact is all that in reality
corresponds to the volonté générale of the classical doctrine. So far as this
is so, the will of the people is the product and not the motive power of the
political process.
The ways in which issues and the popular will on any issue are being
manufactured is exactly analogous to the ways of commercial advertising.
We find the same attempts to contact the subconscious. We find the same
technique of creating favorable and unfavorable associations which are the
more effective the less rational they are. We find the same evasions and
reticences and the same trick of producing opinion by reiterated assertion
that is successful precisely to the extent to which it avoids rational argument
and the danger of awakening the critical faculties of the people. And so on.
Only, all these arts have infinitely more scope in the sphere of public affairs
than they have in the sphere of private and professional life. The picture of
the prettiest girl that ever lived will in the long run prove powerless to
maintain the sales of a bad cigarette. There is no equally effective safeguard
in the case of political decisions. Many decisions of fateful importance are
of a nature that makes it impossible for the public to experiment with them
at its leisure and at moderate cost. Even if that is possible, however,
judgment is as a rule not so easy to arrive at as it is in the case of the
cigarette, because effects are less easy to interpret.
But such arts also vitiate, to an extent quite unknown in the field of
commercial advertising, those forms of political advertising that profess to
address themselves to reason. To the observer, the anti-rational or, at all
events, the extra-rational appeal and the defenselessness of the victim stand
out more and not less clearly when cloaked in facts and arguments. We have
seen above why it is so difficult to impart to the public unbiased information
about political problems and logically correct inferences from it and why it
is that information and arguments in political matters will “register” only if
they link up with the citizen’s preconceived ideas. As a rule, however, these
Socialism and Democracy264
ideas are not definite enough to determine particular conclusions. Since they
can themselves be manufactured, effective political argument almost
inevitably implies the attempt to twist existing volitional premises into a
particular shape and not merely the attempt to implement them or to help
the citizen to make up his mind.
Thus information and arguments that are really driven home are likely to
be the servants of political intent. Since the first thing man will do for his ideal
or interest is to lie, we shall expect, and as a matter of fact we find, that
effective information is almost always adulterated or selective 18 and that
effective reasoning in politics consists mainly in trying to exalt certain
propositions into axioms and to put others out of court; it thus reduces to the
psycho-technics mentioned before. The reader who thinks me unduly
pessimistic need only ask himself whether he has never heard—or said
himself—that this or that awkward fact must not be told publicly, or that a
certain line of reasoning, though valid, is undesirable. If men who according
to any current standard are perfectly honorable or even high-minded reconcile
themselves to the implications of this, do they not thereby show what they
think about the merits or even the existence of the will of the people?
There are of course limits to all this. 19 And there is truth in Jefferson’s
dictum that in the end the people are wiser than any single individual can
be, or in Lincoln’s about the impossibility of “fooling all the people all the
time.” But both dicta stress the long-run aspect in a highly significant way.
It is no doubt possible to argue that given time the collective psyche will
evolve opinions that not infrequently strike us as highly reasonable and even
shrewd. History however consists of a succession of short-run situations that
may alter the course of events for good. If all the people can in the short
run be “fooled” step by step into something they do not really want, and if
this is not an exceptional case which we could afford to neglect, then no
amount of retrospective common sense will alter the fact that in reality they
neither raise nor decide issues but that the issues that shape their fate are
normally raised and decided for them. More than anyone else the lover of
democracy has every reason to accept this fact and to clear his creed from
the aspersion that it rests upon make-believe.

But how is it possible that a doctrine so patently contrary to fact should have
survived to this day and continued to hold its place in the hearts of the people
18 Selective information, if in itself correct, is an attempt to lie by speaking the truth.
19 Possibly they might show more clearly if issues were more frequently decided by
referendum. Politicians presumably know why they are almost invariably hostile to that
institution.
The Classical Doctrine of Democracy 265
and in the official language of governments? The refuting facts are known
to all; everybody admits them with perfect, frequently with cynical,
frankness. The theoretical basis, utilitarian rationalism, is dead; nobody
accepts it as a correct theory of the body politic. Nevertheless that question
is not difficult to answer.
First of all, though the classical doctrine of collective action may not be
supported-by the results of empirical analysis, it is powerfully supported by
that association with religious belief to which I have adverted already. This
may not be obvious at first sight. The utilitarian leaders were anything but
religious in the ordinary sense of the term. In fact they believed themselves
to be anti-religious and they were so considered almost universally. They
took pride in what they thought was precisely an unmetaphysical attitude and
they were quite out of sympathy with the religious institutions and the
religious movements of their time. But we need only cast another glance at
the picture they drew of the social process in order to discover that it
embodied essential features of the faith of protestant Christianity and was
in fact derived from that faith. For the intellectual who had cast off his
religion the utilitarian creed provided a substitute for it. For many of those
who had retained their religious belief the classical doctrine became the
political complement of it. 20
Thus transposed into the categories of religion, this doctrine—and in
consequence the kind of democratic persuasion which is based upon it—
changes its very nature. There is no longer any need for logical scruples
about the Common Good and Ultimate Values. All this is settled for us by
the plan of the Creator whose purpose defines and sanctions everything.
What seemed indefinite or unmotivated before is suddenly quite definite
and convincing. The voice of the people that is the voice of God for
instance. Or take Equality. Its very meaning is in doubt, and there is hardly
any rational warrant for exalting it into a postulate, so long as we move in
the sphere of empirical analysis. But Christianity harbors a strong
equalitarian element. The Redeemer died for all: He did not differentiate
between individuals of different social status. In doing so, He testified to
the intrinsic value of the individual soul, a value that admits of no
gradations. Is not this a sanction—and, as it seems to me, the only possible
20 Observe the analogy with socialist belief which also is a substitute for Christian belief
to some and a complement of it to others.
21 It might be objected that, however difficult it may be to attach a general meaning to the
word Equality, such meaning can be unraveled from its context in most if not all cases. For
instance, it may be permissible to infer from the circumstances in which the Gettysburg address
was delivered that by the “proposition that all men are created free and equal,” Lincoln simply
meant equality of legal status versus the kind of inequality that is implied in the recognition
of slavery. This meaning would be definite enough. But if we ask why that proposition should
Socialism and Democracy266
sanction 21 —of “everyone to count for one, no one to count for more than
one”—a sanction that pours super-mundane meaning into articles of the
democratic creed for which it is not easy to find any other? To be sure this
interpretation does not cover the whole ground. However, so far as it goes,
it seems to explain many things that otherwise would be unexplainable and
in fact meaningless. In particular, it explains the believer’s attitude toward
criticism: again, as in the case of socialism, fundamental dissent is looked
upon not merely as error but as sin; it elicits not merely logical
counterargument but also moral indignation.
We may put our problem differently and say that democracy, when
motivated in this way, ceases to be a mere method that can be discussed
rationally like a steam engine or a disinfectant. It actually becomes what from
another standpoint I have held it incapable of becoming, viz., an ideal or rather
a part of an ideal schema of things. The very word may become a flag, a
symbol of all a man holds dear, of everything that he loves about his nation
whether rationally contingent to it or not. On the one hand, the question how
the various propositions implied in the democratic belief are related to the facts
of politics will then become as irrelevant to him as is, to the believing Catholic,
the question how the doings of Alexander VI tally with the supernatural halo
surrounding the papal office. On the other hand, the democrat of this type,
while accepting postulates carrying large implications about equality and
brotherliness, will be in a position also to accept, in all sincerity, almost any
amount of deviations from them that his own behavior or position may involve.
That is not even illogical. Mere distance from fact is no argument against an
ethical maxim or a mystical hope.
Second, there is the fact that the forms and phrases of classical democracy
are for many nations associated with events and developments in their history
which are enthusiastically approved by large majorities. Any opposition to
an established regime is likely to use these forms and phrases whatever its
meaning and social roots may be. 22 If it prevails and if subsequent
developments prove satisfactory, then these forms will take root in the
national ideology.
The United States is the outstanding example. Its very existence as a
sovereign state is associated with a struggle against a monarchial and
aristocratic England. A minority of loyalists excepted, Americans had, at the
be morally and politically binding and if we refuse to answer “Because every man is by nature
exactly like every other man,” then we can only fall back upon the divine sanction supplied by
Christian belief. This solution is conceivably implied in the word “created.”
22 It might seem that an exception should be made for oppositions that issue into frankly
autocratic regimes. But even most of these rose, as a matter of history, in democratic ways and
based their rule on the approval of the people. Caesar was not killed by plebeians. But the
aristocratic oligarchs who did kill him also used democratic phrases.
The Classical Doctrine of Democracy 267
time of the Grenville administration, probably ceased to look upon the
English monarch as their king and the English aristocracy as their
aristocracy. In the War of Independence they fought what in fact as well as
in their feeling had become a foreign monarch and a foreign aristocracy who
interfered with their political and economic interests. Yet from an early stage
of the troubles they presented their case, which really was a national one,
as a case of the “people” versus its “rulers,” in terms of inalienable Rights
of Man and in the light of the general principles of classical democracy. The
wording of the Declaration of Independence and of the Constitution adopted
these principles. A prodigious development followed that absorbed and
satisfied most people and thereby seemed to verify the doctrine embalmed
in the sacred documents of the nation.
Oppositions rarely conquer when the groups in possession are in the
prime of their power and success. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
the oppositions that professed the classical creed of democracy rose and
eventually prevailed against governments some of which—especially in
Italy—were obviously in a state of decay and had become bywords of
incompetence, brutality and corruption. Naturally though not quite logically,
this redounded to the credit of that creed which moreover showed up to
advantage when compared with the benighted superstitions sponsored by
those governments. Under these circumstances, democratic revolution meant
the advent of freedom and decency, and the democratic creed meant a gospel
of reason and betterment. To be sure, this advantage was bound to be lost
and the gulf between the doctrine and the practice of democracy was bound
to be discovered. But the glamour of the dawn was slow to fade.
Third, it must not be forgotten that there are social patterns in which the
classical doctrine will actually fit facts with a sufficient degree of
approximation. As has been pointed out, this is the case with many small and
primitive societies which as a matter of fact served as a prototype to the
authors of that doctrine. It may be the case also with societies that are not
primitive provided they are not too differentiated and do not harbor any
serious problems. Switzerland is the best example. There is so little to quarrel
about in a world of peasants which, excepting hotels and banks, contains no
great capitalist industry, and the problems of public policy are so simple and
so stable that an overwhelming majority can be expected to understand them
and to agree about them. But if we can conclude that in such cases the
classical doctrine approximates reality we have to add immediately that it
does so not because it describes an effective mechanism of political decision
but only because there are no great decisions to be made. Finally, the case
of the United States may again be invoked in order to show that the classical
doctrine sometimes appears to fit facts even in a society that is big and highly differentiated and in which there are great issues to decide provided the sting is taken out of them by favorable conditions. Until this country’s entry into
the First World War, the public mind was concerned mainly with the business
of exploiting the economic possibilities of the environment. So long as this
business was not seriously interfered with nothing mattered fundamentally
to the average citizen who looked on the antics of politicians with good-
natured contempt. Sections might get excited over the tariff, over silver, over
local misgovernment, or over an occasional squabble with England. The
people at large did not care much, except in the one case of serious
disagreement which in fact produced national disaster, the Civil War.
And fourth, of course, politicians appreciate a phraseology that flatters the
masses and offers an excellent opportunity not only for evading
responsibility but also for crushing opponents in the name of the people.
