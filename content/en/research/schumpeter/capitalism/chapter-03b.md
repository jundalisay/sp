Marx' theory of value is unsatisfactory. 

The right is not all on one side.

Many faulty arguments have been used by its opponents. 

The essential point is not whether labor is the true “source” or “cause” of economic value. 

This question may be of primary interest to social philosophers who want to deduce from it ethical claims to the product,
and Marx himself was of course not indifferent to this aspect of the problem.

For economics as a positive science, however, which has to describe or explain actual processes, it is much more important to ask how the labor
theory of value works as a tool of analysis, and the real trouble with it is that it does so very badly.

<!-- 2 It may, however, be open to question whether this is all that mattered to Marx himself.
He was under the same delusion as Aristotle, viz., that value, though a factor in the
determination of relative prices, is yet something that is different from, and exists independently
of, relative prices or exchange relations. The proposition that the value of a commodity is the
amount of labor embodied in it can hardly mean anything else. If so, then there is a difference
between Ricardo and Marx, since Ricardo’s values are simply exchange values or relative prices.
It is worth while to mention this because, if we could accept this view of value, much of his
theory that seems to us untenable or even meaningless would cease to be so. Of course we
cannot. Nor would the situation be improved if, following some Marxologists, we took the view
that whether a distinct “substance” or not, Marx’s labor-quantity values are merely intended
to serve as tools by which to display the division of total social income into labor income and
capital income (the theory of individual relative prices being then a secondary matter). For, as
we shall see presently, Marx’s theory of value also fails at this task (granted that we can divorce
that task from the problem of individual prices). -->


- It does not work at all outside of the case of perfect competition. 
- Even with perfect competition it never works smoothly except if labor is the only factor of production and, moreover, if
labor is all of one kind. 3 

If either of these two conditions is not fulfilled,
additional assumptions must be introduced and analytical difficulties
increase to an extent that soon becomes unmanageable. Reasoning on the
lines of the labor theory of value is hence reasoning on a very special case
without practical importance, though something might be said for it if it
be interpreted in the sense of a rough approximation to the historical
tendencies of relative values. 

The theory which replaced it—in its earliest
and now outmoded form, known as the theory of marginal utility—may
claim superiority on many counts but the real argument for it is that it is
much more general and applies equally well, on the one hand, to the cases
of monopoly and imperfect competition and, on the other hand, to the
presence of other factors and of labor of many different kinds and qualities.


Moreover, if we introduce into this theory the restrictive assumptions
mentioned, proper tionality between value and quantity of labor applied
follows from it. 4 It should be clear, therefore, not only that it was perfectly
absurd for Marxists to question, as at first they tried to do, the validity of
the marginal utility theory of value (which was what confronted them), but
also that it is incorrect to call the labor theory of value “wrong.” In any
case it is dead and buried.


3 The necessity for the second assumption is particularly damaging. The labor theory
of value may be able to deal with differences in quality of labor that are due to training
(acquired skill): appropriate quota of the work that goes into the process of training would
then have to be added to every hour of skilled work so that we might, without leaving the
range of the principle, put the hour of work done by a skilled workman equal to a
determined multiple of an hour of unskilled work. But this method fails in the case of
“natural” differences in quality of work due to differences in intelligence, will power,
physical strength or agility Then recourse must be had to the difference in value of the
hours respectively worked by the naturally inferior and the naturally superior workmen—
a value that is not itself explainable on the labor-quantity principle. In fact Ricardo does
precisely this: he simply says that those different qualities will somehow be put into their
right relation by the play of the market mechanism so that we may after all speak of an
hour’s work done by workman A being equivalent to a definite multiple of the work done
by workman B. But he completely overlooks that in arguing in this way he appeals to
another principle of valuation and really surrenders the labor-quantity principle which thus
fails from the start, within its own precincts, and before it has the chance to fail because
of the presence of factors other than labor.


4 In fact, it follows from the marginal utility theory of value that for equilibrium
to exist each factor must be so distributed over the productive uses open to it that the
last unit allocated to any use produces the same value as the last unit allocated to each
of the other uses. If there be no other factors except labor of one kind and quality, this
obviously means that the relative values or prices of all commodities must be
proportional to the numbers of man-hours contained in them, provided there is perfect
competition and mobility.


2. Though neither Ricardo nor Marx seems to have been fully aware of all the weaknesses of the position in which they had placed themselves by
adopting this starting point, they perceived some of them quite clearly. 

In
particular, they both grappled with the problem of eliminating the element
of Services of Natural Agents which of course are deprived of their proper
place in the process of production and distribution by a theory of value that
rests upon quantity of labor alone. The familiar Ricardian theory of the rent
of land is essentially an attempt to accomplish that elimination and the
Marxian theory is another. As soon as we are in possession of an analytical
apparatus which takes care of rent as naturally as it does of wages, the whole
difficulty vanishes. Hence nothing more need be said about the intrinsic
merits or demerits of Marx’s doctrine of absolute as distinguished from
differential rent, or about its relation to that of Rodbertus.
But even if we let that pass we are still left with the difficulty arising out of
the presence of capital in the sense of a stock of means of production that are
themselves produced. To Ricardo it presented itself very simply: in the famous
Section IV of the first chapter of his Principles he introduces and accepts as a
fact, without attempting to question it, that, where capital goods such as plant,
machinery and raw materials are used in the production of a commodity, this
commodity will sell at a price which will yield a net return to the owner of those
capital goods. He realized that this fact has something to do with the period of
time that elapses between the investment and the emergence of salable products
and that it will enforce deviations of the actual values of these from
proportionality to the man-hours “contained” in them—including the man-hours
that went into the production of the capital goods themselves—whenever these
periods are not the same in all industries. To this he points as coolly as if it
followed from, instead of contradicting, his fundamental theorem about value,
and beyond this he does not really go, confining himself to some secondary
problems that arise in this connection and obviously believing that his theory
still describes the basic determinant of value.
Marx also introduced, accepted and discussed that same fact and never
questioned it as a fact. He also realized that it seems to give the lie to the
labor theory of value. But he recognized the inadequacy of Ricardo’s
treatment of the problem and, while accepting the problem itself in the shape
in which Ricardo presented it, set about to attack it in earnest, devoting to
it about as many hundreds of pages as Ricardo devoted sentences.
