However conclusively those arguments may tell against this
particular conception of the will of the people, they do not debar us from trying to build up nother and more realistic one. I do not intend to question
either the reality or the importance of the socio-psychological facts we
think of when speaking of the will of a nation. 

Their analysis is certainly
the prerequisite for making headway with the problems of democracy. It
would however be better not to retain the term because this tends to
obscure the fact that as soon as we have severed the will of the people from
its utilitarian connotation we are building not merely a different theory of
the same thing, but a theory of a completely different thing. 

We have every
reason to be on our guard against the pitfalls that lie on the path of those
defenders of democracy who while accepting, under pressure of
accumulating evidence, more and more of the facts of the democratic
process, yet try to anoint the results that process turns out with oil taken
from eighteenth-century jars.

<!-- 2 The very meaning of “greatest happiness” is open to serious doubt. But even if this doubt
could be removed and definite meaning could be attached to the sum total of economic
satisfaction of a group of people, that maximum would still be relative to given situations and
valuations which it may be impossible to alter, or compromise on, in a democratic way.
 -->

But though a common will or public opinion of some sort may still
be said to emerge from the infinitely complex jumble of individual and
group-wise situations, volitions, influences, actions and reactions of the
“democratic process,” the result lacks not only rational unity but also
rational sanction. 

The former means that, though from the standpoint of
analysis, the democratic process is not simply chaotic—for the analyst
nothing is chaotic that can be brought within the reach of explanatory
principles—yet the results would not, except by chance, be meaningful
in themselves—as for instance the realization of any definite end or ideal
would be. 

The latter means, since that will is no longer congruent with
any “good,” that in order to claim ethical dignity for the result it will now
be necessary to fall back upon an unqualified confidence in democratic
forms of government as such—a belief that in principle would have to
be independent of the desirability of results. As we have seen, it is not
easy to place oneself on that standpoint. But even if we do so, the
dropping of the utilitarian common good still leaves us with plenty of
difficulties on our hands.

In particular, we still remain under the practical necessity of attributing
to the will of the individual an independence and a rational quality that are
altogether unrealistic. If we are to argue that the will of the citizens per se
is a political factor entitled to respect, it must first exist. That is to say, it
must be something more than an indeterminate bundle of vague impulses
loosely playing about given slogans and mistaken impressions. Everyone
would have to know definitely what he wants to stand for. This definite will
would have to be implemented by the ability to observe and interpret
correctly the facts that are directly accessible to everyone and to sift critically
the information about the facts that are not. 

Finally, from that definite will
and from these ascertained facts a clear and prompt conclusion as to particular issues would have to be derived according to the rules of logical
inference—with so high a degree of general efficiency moreover that one
man’s opinion could be held, without glaring absurdity, to be roughly as
good as every other man’s. 3 

All this the modal citizen would have to
perform for himself and independently of pressure groups and propaganda, 4
for volitions and inferences that are imposed upon the electorate obviously
do not qualify for ultimate data of the democratic process. The question
whether these conditions are fulfilled to the extent required in order to make
democracy work should not be answered by reckless assertion or equally
reckless denial. It can be answered only by a laborious appraisal of a maze
of conflicting evidence.

Before embarking upon this, however, I want to make quite sure that the
reader fully appreciates another point that has been made already. I will
therefore repeat that even if the opinions and desires of individual citizens
were perfectly definite and independent data for the democratic process to
work with, and if everyone acted on them with ideal rationality and
promptitude, it would not necessarily follow that the political decisions
produced by that process from the raw material of those individual volitions
would represent anything that could in any convincing sense be called the
will of the people. 

It is not only conceivable but, whenever individual wills
are much divided, very likely that the political decisions produced will not
conform to “what people really want.” Nor can it be replied that, if not
exactly what they want, they will get a “fair compromise.” This may be so.

<!-- 3 This accounts for the strongly equalitarian character both of the classical doctrine of
democracy and of popular democratic beliefs. It will be pointed out later on how Equality may
acquire the status of an ethical postulate. As a factual statement about human nature it cannot
be true in any conceivable sense. In recognition of this the postulate itself has often been
reformulated so as to mean “equality of opportunity.” But, disregarding even the difficulties
inherent in the word opportunity, this reformulation does not help us much because it is actual
and not potential equality of performance in matters of political behavior that is required if each
man’s vote is to carry the same weight in the decision of issues. -->

It should be noted in passing that democratic phraseology has been instrumental in fostering
the association of inequality of any kind with “injustice” which is so important an element in
the psychic pattern of the unsuccessful and in the arsenal of the politician who uses him. One
of the most curious symptoms of this was the Athenian institution of ostracism or rather the
use to which it was sometimes put. Ostracism consisted in banishing an individual by popular
vote, not necessarily for any particular reason: it sometimes served as a method of eliminating
an uncomfortably prominent citizen who was felt to “count for more than one.”
4 This term is here being used in its original sense and not in the sense which it is rapidly
acquiring at present and which suggests the definition: propaganda is any statement emanating
from a source that we do not like. I suppose that the term derives from the name of the
committee of cardinals which deals with matters concerning the spreading of the Catholic faith,
the congregatio de propaganda fide. In itself therefore it does not carry any derogatory meaning
and in particular it does not imply distortion of facts. One can make propaganda, for instance,
for a scientific method. It simply means the presentation of facts and arguments with a view
to influencing people’s actions or opinions in a definite direction.

The chances for this to happen are greatest with those issues which are
quantitative in nature or admit of gradation, such as the question how much
is to be spent on unemployment relief provided everybody favors some
expenditure for that purpose. But with qualitative issues, such as the question
whether to persecute heretics or to enter upon a war, the result attained may
well, though for different reasons, be equally distasteful to all the people
whereas the decision imposed by a non-democratic agency might prove
much more acceptable to them.

An example will illustrate. I may, I take it, describe the rule of
Napoleon, when First Consul, as a military dictatorship. One of the most
pressing political needs of the moment was a religious settlement that
would clear the chaos left by the revolution and the directorate and bring
peace to millions of hearts. This he achieved by a number of master
strokes, culminating in a concordat with the pope (1801) and the “organic
articles” (1802) that, reconciling the irreconcilable, gave just the right
amount of freedom to religious worship while strongly upholding the
authority of the state. He also reorganized and refinanced the French
Catholic church, solved the delicate question of the “constitutional”
clergy, and most successfully launched the new establishment with a
minimum of friction. 

If ever there was any justification at all for holding
that the people actually want something definite, this arrangement affords
one of the best instances in history. This must be obvious to anyone who
looks at the French class structure of that time and it is amply borne out
by the fact that this ecclesiastical policy greatly contributed to the almost
universal popularity which the consular regime enjoyed. But it is difficult
to see how this result could have been achieved in a democratic way.
Anti-church sentiment had not died out and was by no means confined
to the vanquished Jacobins. People of that persuasion, or their leaders,
could not possibly have compromised to that extent. 5 

On the other end of the scale, a strong wave of wrathful Catholic sentiment was steadily
gaining momentum. 

People who shared that sentiment, or leaders dependent on their good will, could not possibly have stopped at the
Napoleonic limit; in particular, they could not have dealt so firmly with
the Holy See for which moreover there would have been no motive to
give in, seeing which way things were moving. 

The will of the peasants who more than anything else wanted their priests, their churches
and processions would have been paralyzed by the very natural fear that
the revolutionary settlement of the land question might be endangered
once the clergy—the bishops especially—were in the saddle again.

<!-- 5 The legislative bodies, cowed though they were, completely failed in fact to support
Napoleon in this policy. And some of his most trusted paladins opposed it. -->

Deadlock or interminable struggle, engendering increasing irritation,
would have been the most probable outcome of any attempt to settle the
question democratically. But Napoleon was able to settle it reasonably,
precisely because all those groups which could not yield their points of
their own accord were at the same time able and willing to accept the
arrangement if imposed.

This instance of course is not an isolated one. 6 If results that prove in the
long run satisfactory to the people at large are made the test of government
for the people, then government by the people, as conceived by the classical
doctrine of democracy, would often fail to meet it.
