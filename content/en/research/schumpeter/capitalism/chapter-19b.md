Suppose that a community, in a way which satisfies the reader’s criteria
of democracy, reached the decision to persecute religious dissent. The
instance is not fanciful. Communities which most of us would readily
recognize as democracies have burned heretics at the stake—the republic
of Geneva did in Calvin’s time—or otherwise persecuted them in a manner
6 In plain English, this saying of one of the more prominent leaders meant that they fully
realized the risk involved in staging bolshevism in a country entirely dependent on capitalist
powers for its food and with French and Italian troops practically at its door, but that, if pressure
from Russia via Hungary should become too great, they would not split the party but would
try to lead the whole flock into the bolshevik camp.

repulsive to our moral standards—colonial Massachusetts may serve as an
example. Cases of this type do not cease to be relevant if they occur in
non-democratic states. For it is naïve to believe that the democratic process
completely ceases to work in an autocracy or that an autocrat never wishes
to act according to the will of the people or to give in to it. Whenever he
does, we may conclude that similar action would have been taken also if
the political pattern had been a democratic one. For instance, at least the
earlier persecutions of the Christians were certainly approved by Roman
public opinion and presumably would have been no milder if Rome had
been a pure democracy. 7

Witch hunting affords another example. It grew out of the very soul of
the masses and was anything but a diabolical invention of priests and
princes who, on the contrary, suppressed it as soon as they felt able to do
so. The Catholic Church, it is true, punished witchcraft. But if we compare
the measures actually taken with those taken against heresy, where Rome
meant business, we immediately have the impression that in the matter of
witchcraft the Holy See gave in to public opinion rather than instigated it.
The Jesuits fought witch hunting, at first unsuccessfully. Toward the end
of the seventeenth and in the eighteenth centuries—that is to say, when
monarchic absolutism was fully established on the continent—
governmental prohibitions eventually prevailed. The curiously cautious way
in which so strong a ruler as the Empress Maria Theresa went about
prohibiting the practice clearly shows that she knew she was fighting the
will of her people.

Finally, to choose an example that has some bearing on modern issues,
anti-Semitism has been one of the most deep-seated of all popular attitudes
in most nations in which there was, relative to total population, any
considerable number of Jews. In modern times this attitude has in part given
way under the rationalizing influence of capitalist evolution, but enough has
remained of it to assure popular success to any politician who cared to appeal
to it. Most of the anti-capitalist movements of our time other than straight
socialism have in fact learned the lesson. In the Middle Ages however, it is
not too much to say that the Jews owed their survival to the protection of

7 An example will illustrate the kind of evidence there is for this statement. Suetonius
in his biography of Nero (De vita Caesarum, liber VI) first relates those acts of the latter’s
reign which he, Suetonius, considered to be partly blameless and partly even commendable
(partim nulla reprehensione, partim etiam non mediocri laude digna) and then his misdeed
(probra ac scelera). The Neronian persecution of the Christians he noted not under the
second but under the first heading in the midst of a list of rather meritorious administrative
measures (afflicti suppliciis Christiani, genus hominum superstitionis novæ ac maleficæ).
There is no reason to suppose that Suetonius expressed anything but the opinion (and, by
inference, the will) of the people. In fact it is not far-fetched to suspect that Nero’s motive
was to please the people.

the church and of the princes who sheltered them in the face of popular
opposition and in the end emancipated them. 8

Now for our experiment. Let us transport ourselves into a hypothetical
country that, in a democratic way, practices the persecution of Christians,
the burning of witches, and the slaughtering of Jews. We should certainly
not approve of these practices on the ground that they have been decided on
according to the rules of democratic procedure. But the crucial question is:
would we approve of the democratic constitution itself that produced such
results in preference to a non-democratic one that would avoid them? If we
do not, we are behaving exactly as fervent socialists behave to whom
capitalism is worse than witch hunting and who are therefore prepared to
accept non-democratic methods for the purpose of suppressing it. As far as
that goes we and they are in the same boat. There are ultimate ideals and
interests which the most ardent democrat will put above democracy, and all
he means if he professes uncompromising allegiance to it is that he feels
convinced that democracy will guarantee those ideals and interests such as
freedom of conscience and speech, justice, decent government and so on.
The reason why this is so is not far to seek. Democracy is a political
method, that is to say, a certain type of institutional arrangement for
arriving at political—legislative and administrative—decisions and hence
incapable of being an end in itself, irrespective of what decisions it will
produce under given historical conditions. And this must be the starting
point of any attempt at defining it.

Whatever the distinctive trait of the democratic method may be, the
historical examples we have just glanced at teach us a few things about it
that are important enough to warrant explicit restatement.

First, these examples suffice to preclude any attempt at challenging the
proposition just stated, viz., that, being a political method, democracy cannot, any
more than can any other method, be an end in itself. It might be objected that as
a matter of logic a method as such can be an absolute ideal or ultimate value. It
can. No doubt one might conceivably hold that, however criminal or stupid the
thing that democratic procedure may strive to accomplish in a given historical
pattern, the will of the people must prevail, or at all events that it must not be
opposed except in the way sanctioned by democratic principles. But it seems much
more natural in such cases to speak of the rabble instead of the people and to fight
its criminality or stupidity by all the means at one’s command.
Second, if we agree that unconditional allegiance to democracy can be

8 The protective attitude of the popes may be instanced by the bull Etsi Judæis (1120) the
repeated confirmation of which by the successors of Calixtus II proves both the continuity of
that policy and the resistance it met. The protective attitude of the princes will be readily
understood if it be pointed out that expulsions or massacres of Jews meant loss of much-needed
revenue to them.

due only to unconditional allegiance to certain interests or ideals which
democracy is expected to serve, our examples also preclude the objection
that though democracy may not be an absolute ideal in its own right, it is
yet a vicarious one by virtue of the fact that it will necessarily, always and
everywhere, serve certain interests or ideals for which we do mean to fight
and die unconditionally. Obviously that cannot be true, 9 No more than any
other political method does democracy always produce the same results or
promote the same interests or ideals. Rational allegiance to it thus
presupposes not only a schema of hyper-rational values but also certain states
of society in which democracy can be expected to work in ways we approve.
Propositions about the working of democracy are meaningless without
reference to given times, places and situations10 and so, of course, are anti-
democratic arguments.

This after all is only obvious. It should not surprise, still less shock,
anyone. For it has nothing to do with the fervor or dignity of democratic
conviction in any given situation. To realize the relative validity of one’s
convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly is what distinguishes a
civilized man from a barbarian.
