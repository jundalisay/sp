II. The SOCIOLOGY of the INTELLECTUAL

Nevertheless, neither the opportunity of attack nor real or fancied grievances
are in themselves sufficient to produce, however strongly they may favor, the
emergence of active hostility against a social order. For such an atmosphere
to develop it is necessary that there be groups to whose interest it is to work
up and organize resentment, to nurse it, to voice it and to lead it. As will be
shown in Part IV, the mass of people never develops definite opinions on its
own initiative. Still less is it able to articulate them and to turn them into
consistent attitudes and actions. All it can do is to follow or refuse to follow
such group leadership as may offer itself. Until we have discovered social
groups that will qualify for that role our theory of the atmosphere of hostility
to capitalism is incomplete.

Broadly speaking, conditions favorable to general hostility to a social
system or specific attack upon it will in any case tend to call forth groups that will exploit them. But in the case of capitalist society there is a further fact to be noted: unlike any other type of society, capitalism inevitably and by virtue
of the very logic of its civilization creates, educates and subsidizes a vested
interest in social unrest.2 

Explanation of this phenomenon, which is as curious
as it is important, follows from our argument in Chapter XI, but may be made
more telling by an excursion into the Sociology of the Intellectual.
This type is not easy to define. The difficulty is in fact symptomatic of
the character of the species. Intellectuals are not a social class in the sense
in which peasants or industrial laborers constitute social classes; they hail
from all the corners of the social world, and a great part of their activities
consist in fighting each other and in forming the spearheads of class interests
not their own. Yet they develop group attitudes and group interests
sufficiently strong to make large numbers of them behave in the way that is
usually associated with the con cept of social classes. Again, they cannot be
simply defined as the sum total of all the people who have had a higher
education; that would obliterate the most important features of the type. 

Yet
anyone who had—and, save exceptional cases, nobody who had not—is a
potential intellectual; and the fact that their minds are all similarly furnished
facilitates understanding between them and constitutes a bond. Nor would
it serve our purpose to make the concept coextensive with the membership
of the liberal professions; physicians or lawyers for instance are not
intellectuals in the relevant sense unless they talk or write about subjects
outside of their professional competence which no doubt they often do—
particularly the lawyers. Yet there is a close connection between the
intellectuals and the professions. For some professions—especially if we
count in journalism—actually do belong almost wholly to the domain of the
intellectual type; the members of all professions have the opportunity of
becoming intellectuals; and many intellectuals take to some profession for
a living. Finally, a definition by means of the contrast to manual labor would
be much too wide. 3 Yet the Duke of Wellington’s “scribbling set” seems to
be too narrow. 4 So is the meaning of hommes de lettres.

<!-- 2 Every social system is sensitive to revolt and in every social system stirring up revolt is a
business that pays in case of success and hence always attracts both brain and brawn. It did in
feudal times—very much so. But warrior nobles who revolted against their superiors attacked
individual persons or positions. They did not attack the feudal system as such. And feudal
society as a whole displayed no tendencies to encourage—intentionally or unintentionally—
attacks upon its own social system as a whole.
3 To my sorrow, I have found that the Oxford English Dictionary does not list the meaning
I wish to attach to the term. It does give the turn of phrase “a dinner of intellectuals,” but in
connection with “superior powers of intellect” which points in a very different direction. I have
been duly disconcerted, yet have not been able to discover another term that would serve my
purpose equally well.
4 The Duke’s phrase occurs in The Croker Papers (ed. L.J.Jennings, 1884). -->

But we might do worse than take our lead from the Iron Duke. Intellectuals
are in fact people who wield the power of the spoken and the written word,
and one of the touches that distinguish them from other people who do the
same is the absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs. This touch in
general accounts for another—the absence of that first-hand knowledge of
them which only actual experience can give. The critical attitude, arising no
less from the intellectual’s situation as an onlooker—in most cases also as an
outsider—than from the fact that his main chance of asserting himself lies in
his actual or potential nuisance value, should add a third touch. The profession
of the unprofessional? Professional dilettantism? The people who talk about
everything because they understand nothing? Bernard Shaw’s journalist in The
Doctor’s Dilemma? No, no. I have not said that and I do not mean that. That
sort of thing would be still more untrue than it would be offensive. Let us give
up trying to define by words and instead define “epideiktically”: in the Greek
museum we can see the object, nicely labeled. The sophists, philosophers and
rhetors—however strongly they objected to being thrown together, they were
all of the same genus—of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. illustrate ideally
what I mean. That practically all of them were teachers does not destroy the
value of the illustration.

2. When analyzing the rationalist nature of capitalist civilization (Chapter
XI) I pointed out that the development of rational thought of course precedes
the rise of the capitalist order by thousands of years; all that capitalism did
was to give a new impulse and a particular bend to the process. Similarly—
leaving aside the Graeco-Roman world—we find intellectuals in thoroughly
pre-capitalist conditions, for instance in the Kingdom of the Franks and in
the countries into which it dissolved. But they were few in number; they
were clergy-men, mostly monks; and their written performance was
accessible to only an infinitesimal part of the population. No doubt strong
individuals were occasionally able to develop unorthodox views and even to
convey them to popular audiences. This however in general implied
antagonizing a very strictly organized environment—from which at the same
time it was difficult to get away—and risking the lot of the heretic. Even so
it was hardly possible without the support or connivance of some great lord
or chieftain, as the tactics of missionaries suffice to show. On the whole,
therefore, intellectuals were well in hand, and kicking over the traces was
no joke, even in times of exceptional disorganization and license, such as
during the Black Death (in and after 1348).
But if the monastery gave birth to the intellectual of the medieval world,
it was capitalism that let him loose and presented him with the printing press.
The slow; evolution of the lay intellectual was merely an aspect of this
process; the coincidence of the emergence of humanism with the emergence
Can Capitalism Survive?148
of capitalism is very striking. The humanists were primarily philologists
but—excellently illustrating a point made above—they quickly expanded into
the fields of manners, politics, religion and philosophy. This was not alone
due to the contents of the classic works which they interpreted along with
their grammar—from the criticism of a text to the criticism of a society, the
way is shorter than it seems. Nevertheless, the typical intellectual did not
relish the idea of the stake which still awaited the heretic. As a rule, honors
and comfort suited him a great deal better. And these were after all to be
had only from princes, temporal or spiritual, though the humanists were the
first intellectuals to have a public in the modern sense. The critical attitude
grew stronger every day. But social criticism—beyond what was implied in
certain attacks on the Catholic Church and in particular its head—did not
flourish under such conditions.

Honors and emoluments can however be had in more than one way.
Flattery and subservience are often less remunerative than are their opposites.
This discovery was not made by the Aretino 5 but no mortal ever surpassed
him in exploiting it. Charles V was a devoted husband but, during his
campaigns which kept him from home for many months at a time, he lived
the life of a gentleman of his time and class. Very well, the public—and what
particularly mattered to Charles, his empress—need never know, provided
arguments of the right kind and weight were duly handed to the great critic
of politics and morals. Charles paid up. But the point is that this was not
simple blackmail which in general benefits one party only and inflicts
uncompensated loss on the other. Charles knew why he paid though
doubtless it would have been possible to secure silence by cheaper if more
drastic methods. He did not display resentment. On the contrary he even
went out of his way to honor the man. Obviously he wanted more than
silence and, as a matter of fact, he received full value for his gifts.
