## 2. The Sociology Of The Intellectual

Nevertheless, neither the opportunity of attack nor real or fancied grievances are in themselves sufficient to produce, however strongly they may favor, the emergence of active hostility against a social order.

For such an atmosphere
to develop it is necessary that there be groups to whose interest it is to work
up and organize resentment, to nurse it, to voice it and to lead it. As will be
shown in Part IV, the mass of people never develops definite opinions on its
own initiative. Still less is it able to articulate them and to turn them into
consistent attitudes and actions. All it can do is to follow or refuse to follow
such group leadership as may offer itself. Until we have discovered social
groups that will qualify for that role our theory of the atmosphere of hostility
to capitalism is incomplete.

Broadly speaking, conditions favorable to general hostility to a social
system or specific attack upon it will in any case tend to call forth groups that will exploit them. But in the case of capitalist society there is a further fact to be noted: unlike any other type of society, capitalism inevitably and by virtue
of the very logic of its civilization creates, educates and subsidizes a vested
interest in social unrest.2 

Explanation of this phenomenon, which is as curious
as it is important, follows from our argument in Chapter XI, but may be made
more telling by an excursion into the Sociology of the Intellectual.
This type is not easy to define. The difficulty is in fact symptomatic of
the character of the species. 

Intellectuals are not a social class in the sense
in which peasants or industrial laborers constitute social classes; they hail
from all the corners of the social world, and a great part of their activities
consist in fighting each other and in forming the spearheads of class interests
not their own. Yet they develop group attitudes and group interests
sufficiently strong to make large numbers of them behave in the way that is
usually associated with the con cept of social classes. Again, they cannot be
simply defined as the sum total of all the people who have had a higher
education; that would obliterate the most important features of the type. 

Yet
anyone who had—and, save exceptional cases, nobody who had not—is a
potential intellectual; and the fact that their minds are all similarly furnished
facilitates understanding between them and constitutes a bond. Nor would
it serve our purpose to make the concept coextensive with the membership
of the liberal professions; physicians or lawyers for instance are not
intellectuals in the relevant sense unless they talk or write about subjects
outside of their professional competence which no doubt they often do—
particularly the lawyers. 

Yet there is a close connection between the
intellectuals and the professions. For some professions—especially if we
count in journalism—actually do belong almost wholly to the domain of the
intellectual type; the members of all professions have the opportunity of
becoming intellectuals; and many intellectuals take to some profession for
a living. Finally, a definition by means of the contrast to manual labor would
be much too wide. 3 Yet the Duke of Wellington’s “scribbling set” seems to
be too narrow. 4 So is the meaning of hommes de lettres.

<!-- 2 Every social system is sensitive to revolt and in every social system stirring up revolt is a
business that pays in case of success and hence always attracts both brain and brawn. It did in
feudal times—very much so. But warrior nobles who revolted against their superiors attacked
individual persons or positions. They did not attack the feudal system as such. And feudal
society as a whole displayed no tendencies to encourage—intentionally or unintentionally—
attacks upon its own social system as a whole.
3 To my sorrow, I have found that the Oxford English Dictionary does not list the meaning
I wish to attach to the term. It does give the turn of phrase “a dinner of intellectuals,” but in
connection with “superior powers of intellect” which points in a very different direction. I have
been duly disconcerted, yet have not been able to discover another term that would serve my
purpose equally well.
4 The Duke’s phrase occurs in The Croker Papers (ed. L.J.Jennings, 1884). -->

But we might do worse than take our lead from the Iron Duke. Intellectuals
are in fact people who wield the power of the spoken and the written word,
and one of the touches that distinguish them from other people who do the
same is the absence of direct responsibility for practical affairs. This touch in
general accounts for another—the absence of that first-hand knowledge of
them which only actual experience can give. The critical attitude, arising no
less from the intellectual’s situation as an onlooker—in most cases also as an
outsider—than from the fact that his main chance of asserting himself lies in
his actual or potential nuisance value, should add a third touch. The profession
of the unprofessional? Professional dilettantism? 

The people who talk about
everything because they understand nothing? Bernard Shaw’s journalist in The
Doctor’s Dilemma? No, no. I have not said that and I do not mean that. That
sort of thing would be still more untrue than it would be offensive. Let us give
up trying to define by words and instead define “epideiktically”: in the Greek
museum we can see the object, nicely labeled. The sophists, philosophers and
rhetors—however strongly they objected to being thrown together, they were
all of the same genus—of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. illustrate ideally
what I mean. That practically all of them were teachers does not destroy the
value of the illustration.

2. When analyzing the rationalist nature of capitalist civilization (Chapter XI) I pointed out that the development of rational thought of course precedes the rise of the capitalist order by thousands of years; all that capitalism did was to give a new impulse and a particular bend to the process. Similarly— leaving aside the Graeco-Roman world—we find intellectuals in thoroughly pre-capitalist conditions, for instance in the Kingdom of the Franks and in the countries into which it dissolved.

But they were few in number; they
were clergy-men, mostly monks; and their written performance was
accessible to only an infinitesimal part of the population. No doubt strong
individuals were occasionally able to develop unorthodox views and even to
convey them to popular audiences. This however in general implied
antagonizing a very strictly organized environment—from which at the same
time it was difficult to get away—and risking the lot of the heretic. Even so
it was hardly possible without the support or connivance of some great lord
or chieftain, as the tactics of missionaries suffice to show. On the whole,
therefore, intellectuals were well in hand, and kicking over the traces was
no joke, even in times of exceptional disorganization and license, such as
during the Black Death (in and after 1348).

But if the monastery gave birth to the intellectual of the medieval world,
it was capitalism that let him loose and presented him with the printing press.
The slow; evolution of the lay intellectual was merely an aspect of this
process; the coincidence of the emergence of humanism with the emergence of capitalism is very striking. The humanists were primarily philologists but—excellently illustrating a point made above—they quickly expanded into
the fields of manners, politics, religion and philosophy. 

This was not alone
due to the contents of the classic works which they interpreted along with
their grammar—from the criticism of a text to the criticism of a society, the
way is shorter than it seems. Nevertheless, the typical intellectual did not
relish the idea of the stake which still awaited the heretic. As a rule, honors
and comfort suited him a great deal better. And these were after all to be
had only from princes, temporal or spiritual, though the humanists were the
first intellectuals to have a public in the modern sense. The critical attitude
grew stronger every day. But social criticism—beyond what was implied in
certain attacks on the Catholic Church and in particular its head—did not
flourish under such conditions.

Honors and emoluments can however be had in more than one way.
Flattery and subservience are often less remunerative than are their opposites.
This discovery was not made by the Aretino 5 but no mortal ever surpassed
him in exploiting it. Charles V was a devoted husband but, during his
campaigns which kept him from home for many months at a time, he lived
the life of a gentleman of his time and class. Very well, the public—and what
particularly mattered to Charles, his empress—need never know, provided
arguments of the right kind and weight were duly handed to the great critic
of politics and morals. Charles paid up. But the point is that this was not
simple blackmail which in general benefits one party only and inflicts
uncompensated loss on the other. Charles knew why he paid though
doubtless it would have been possible to secure silence by cheaper if more
drastic methods. He did not display resentment. On the contrary he even
went out of his way to honor the man. Obviously he wanted more than
silence and, as a matter of fact, he received full value for his gifts.


product but partly an independent phenomenon due to the access of wealth
and weight which came to the industrial bourgeoisie and to the incident
increase in the political importance of an anonymous public opinion—all
these boons, as well as increasing freedom from restraint, are by-products
of the capitalist engine.

In the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century the individual
patron was slow to lose the paramount importance in the intellectual’s
career that he had held at the beginning. But in the peak successes at
least, we clearly discern the growing importance of the new element—
the support of the collective patron, the bourgeois public. In this as in
every other respect, Voltaire affords an invaluable instance. His very
superficiality that made it possible for him to cover everything from
religion to Newtonian optics, allied to indomitable vitality and an
insatiable curiosity, a perfect absence of inhibitions, an unerring instinct
for and a wholesale acceptance of the humors of his time, enabled that
uncritical critic and mediocre poet and historian to fascinate—and to sell.
He also speculated, cheated, accepted gifts and appointments, but there
was always the independence founded on the solid base of his success
with the public. Rousseau’s case and type, though entirely different,
would be still more instructive to discuss.

In the last decades of the eighteenth century a striking episode displayed
the nature of the power of a free-lance intellectual who has nothing to work
with but the socio-psychological mechanism called Public Opinion. This
happened in England, the country that was then farthest advanced on the
road of capitalist evolution. John Wilkes’ attacks on the political system of
England, it is true, were launched under uniquely favorable circumstances;
moreover, it cannot be said that he actually upset the Earl of Bute’s
government which never had any chance and was bound to fall for a dozen
other reasons; but Wilkes’ North Briton was nevertheless the last straw that
broke…Lord Bute’s political back. No. 45 of the North Briton was the first
discharge in a campaign that secured the abolition of general warrants and
made a great stride toward the freedom of the press and of elections. This
does not amount to making history or to creating the conditions for a change
in social institutions, but it does amount to playing, say, the role of a
midwife’s assistant. 7 

<!-- 7 I do not fear that any historian of politics will find that I have exaggerated the importance
of Wilkes’ success. But I do fear objection to my calling him a free lance and to the implication
that he owed everything to the collective, and nothing to any individual patron. In his beginnings
he was no doubt encouraged by a coterie. On examination it will however be conceded, I think,
that this was not of decisive importance and that all the support and all the money and honors
he got afterwards were but a consequence of and tribute to previous success and to a position
independently acquired with the public. -->

The inability of Wilkes’ enemies to thwart him is the most significant fact about it all. They evidently had all the power of
organized government at their command. Yet something drove them back.
In France, the years preceding the revolution and the revolution itself
brought the rabble-raising tabloid (Marat, Desmoulins), which however did
not, like ours, completely jettison style and grammar. But we must hurry on.
The Terror and, more systematically, the First Empire put an end to this. Then
followed a period, interrupted by the rule of the roi bourgeois, of more or less
resolute repression that lasted until the Second Empire felt compelled to loosen
the reins—about the middle sixties. 

In central and southern Europe this period
also lasted about as long, and in England analogous conditions prevailed from
the beginning of the revolutionary wars to Canning’s accession to power.

4. How impossible it is to stem the tide within the framework of
capitalist society is shown by the failure of the attempts—some of them
prolonged and determined—made during that period by practically all
European governments to bring the intellectuals to heel Their histories
were nothing but so many different versions of Wilkes exploits. 

In
capitalist society—or in a society that contains a capitalist element of
decisive importance—any attack on the intellectuals must run up against
the private fortresses of bourgeois business which, or some of which, will
shelter the quarry. Moreover such an attack must proceed according to
bourgeois principles of legislative and administrative practice which no
doubt may be stretched and bent but will checkmate prosecution beyond
a certain point. Lawless violence the bourgeois stratum may accept or
even applaud when thoroughly roused or frightened, but only temporarily.
In a purely bourgeois regime like that of Louis Philippe, troops may fire
on strikers, but the police cannot round up intellectuals or must release
them forthwith; otherwise the bourgeois stratum, however strongly
disapproving some of their. doings, will rally behind them because the
freedom it disapproves cannot be crushed without also crushing the
freedom it approves.

Observe that I am not crediting the bourgeoisie with an unrealistic dose
of generosity or idealism. Nor am I unduly stressing what people think and
feel and want—on the importance of which I almost, though not quite, agree
with Marx. In defending the intellectuals as a group—not of course every
individual—the bourgeoisie defends itself and its scheme of life. Only a
government of non-bourgeois nature and non-bourgeois creed—under
modern circumstances only a socialist or fascist one—is strong enough to
discipline them. In order to do that it would have to change typically
bourgeois institutions and drastically reduce the individual freedom of all
strata of the nation. And such a government is not likely—it would not even
be able—to stop short of private enterprise.

From this follows both the unwillingness and the inability of the
capitalist order to control its intellectual sector effectively. The
unwillingness in question is unwillingness to use methods consistently
that are uncongenial to the mentality shaped by the capitalist process; the
inability is the inability to do so within the frame of institutions shaped
by the capitalist process and without submitting to non-bourgeois rule.
Thus, on the one hand, freedom of public discussion involving freedom
to nibble at the foundations of capitalist society is inevitable in the long
run. On the other hand, the intellectual group cannot help nibbling,
because it lives on criticism and its whole position depends on criticism
that stings; and criticism of persons and of current events will, in a
situation in which nothing is sacrosanct, fatally issue in criticism of
classes and institutions.

5. A few strokes will complete the modern picture. There are the
increasing means. There is the increase in the standard of life and in the
leisure of the masses that changed and is still changing the composition
of the collective patron for the tastes of whom the intellectuals have to
provide. There was and is the further cheapening of the book and
newspaper and the large-scale newspaper concern. 8 There is now the
radio. And there was and is the tendency toward complete removal of
restraints, steadily breaking down those short-run attempts at resistance
by which bourgeois society proves itself so incompetent and occasionally
so childish a disciplinarian.

<!-- 8 The emergence and the career up to date of the large-scale newspaper concern illustrate
two points which I am anxious to stress: the manifold aspects, relations and effects of every
concrete element of the social pattern that preclude simple and one-way propositions, and the
importance of distinguishing short-run and long-run phenomena for which different, sometimes
opposite, propositions hold true. The large-scale newspaper concern is in most cases simply a
capitalist business enterprise. This does not imply that it espouses capitalist or any other class
interests. It may do so, but only from one or more of the following motives, the limited
importance of which is obvious: because it is subsidized by a capitalist group for the very
purpose of advocating its interests or views—the larger the concern and its sales, the less
important this element; because it intends to sell to a public of bourgeois tastes—this, very
important until about 1914, now increasingly cuts the other way; because advertisers prefer to
use a congenial medium—but mostly they take a very businesslike view of the matter; because
the owners insist on a certain course irrespective of their interest in sales—to a certain extent,
they do and especially did, but experience teaches that they do not hold out if the conflict with
their pecuniary interest in sales is too severe. In other words, the large-scale newspaper concern
is a most powerful tool for raising the position and increasing the influence of the intellectual
group, but it is even now not completely in its control. It means employment and a wider public,
but it also means “strings.” These are mainly of importance in the short run; in fighting for
greater freedom to do as he pleases, the individual journalist may easily meet defeat. But this
short-run aspect—and the group’s recollection of past conditions—are what enters the
intellectual’s mind and what determines the colors of the picture of slavery and martyrdom he
draws for the public. In reality, it should be a picture of conquest. Conquest and victory are in
this, as in so many other cases, a mosaic composed of defeats. -->
