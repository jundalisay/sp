PART II Can Capitalism Survive?
 
PROLOGUE

CAN capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can. But this opinion of
mine, like that of every other economist who has pronounced upon the
subject, is in itself completely uninteresting. What counts in any attempt at
social prognosis is not the Yes or No that sums up the facts and arguments
which lead up to it but those facts and arguments themselves. They contain
all that is scientific in the final result. Everything else is not science but
prophecy. Analysis, whether economic or other, never yields more than a
statement about the tendencies present in an observable pattern. And these
never tell us what will happen to the pattern but only what would happen if
they continued to act as they have been acting in the time interval covered
by our observation and if no other factors intruded. “Inevitability” or
“necessity” can never mean more than this.


What follows must be read with that proviso. But there are other
limitations to our results and their reliability. The process of social life is
a function of so many variables many of which are not amenable to
anything like measurement that even mere diagnosis of a given state of
things becomes a doubtful matter quite apart from the formidable sources
of error that open up as soon as we attempt prognosis. These difficulties
should not be exaggerated, however. We shall see that the dominant traits
of the picture clearly support certain inferences which, whatever the
qualifications that may have to be added, are too strong to be neglected
on the ground that they cannot be proved in the sense in which a
proposition of Euclid’s can.

One more point before we start. The thesis I shall endeavor to establish
is that the actual and prospective performance of the capitalist system is
such as to negative the idea of its breaking down under the weight of
economic failure, but that its very success undermines the social
institutions which protect it, and “inevitably” creates conditions in which
it will not be able to live and which strongly point to socialism as the heir
apparent. My final conclusion therefore does not differ, however much my
argument may, from that of most socialist writers and in particular from
that of all Marxists. But in order to accept it one does not need to be a
socialist. Prognosis does not imply anything about the desirability of the
course of events that one predicts. If a doctor predicts that his patient will
die presently, this does not mean that he desires it. One may hate socialism or at least look upon it with cool criticism, and yet foresee its advent. Many conservatives did and do.

Nor need one accept this conclusion in order to qualify as a socialist. One
may love socialism and ardently believe in its economic, cultural and ethical
superiority but nevertheless believe at the same time that capitalist society
does not harbor any tendency toward self-destruction. There are in fact
socialists who believe that the capitalist order is gathering strength and is
entrenching itself as time goes on, so that it is chimerical to hope for its
breakdown.



## CHAPTER 5: THE RATE OF INCREASE OF TOTAL OUTPUT

The atmosphere of hostility to capitalism which we shall have to explain
presently makes it much more difficult than it otherwise would be to
form a rational opinion about its economic and cultural performance. The
public mind has by now so thoroughly grown out of humor with it as to
make condemnation of capitalism and all its works a foregone conclusion—
almost a requirement of the etiquette of discussion. Whatever his political
preference, every writer or speaker hastens to conform to this code and to
emphasize his critical attitude, his freedom from “complacency,” his belief
in the inadequacies of capitalist achievement, his aversion to capitalist and
his sympathy with anti-capitalist interests. Any other attitude is voted not
only foolish but anti-social and is looked upon as an indication of immoral
servitude. This is of course perfectly natural. New social religions will
always have that effect. Only it does not make it easier to fulfill the analyst’s
task: in 300 A.D. it would not have been easy to expound the achievements
of ancient civilization to a fervent believer in Christianity. On the one hand,
the most obvious truths are simply put out of court a limine;1 on the other
hand, the most obvious misstatements are borne with or applauded.

A first test of economic performance is total output, the total of all the
commodities and services produced in a unit of time—a year or a quarter
of a year or a month. Economists try to measure variations in this quantity
by means of indices derived from a number of series representing the output
of individual commodities. “Strict logic is a stern master, and if one
respected it, one would never construct or use any production index,” 2 for
not only the material and the technique of constructing such an index, but
the very concept of a total output of different commodities produced in ever-
changing proportions, is a highly doubtful matter. 3 Nevertheless, I believe
that this device is sufficiently reliable to give us a general idea.

<!-- 1 There is however another method of dealing with obvious though uncomfortable truth, viz.,
the method of sneering at its triviality. Such a sneer will serve as well as a refutation would,
for the average audience is as a rule perfectly unaware of the fact that it often covers the
impossibility of denial—a pretty specimen of social psychology.
2 A.F.Burns, Production Trends in the United States Since 1870, p. 262.
3 We cannot enter into this problem here. A little will, however, be said about it when
we meet it again in the next chapter. For a fuller treatment see my book on Business
Cycles, ch. ix. -->

For the United States, individual series good and numerous enough to
warrant construction of such an index of output are available since the Civil
War. Choosing what is known as the Day-Persons index of total production 4
we find that, from 1870 to 1930, the average annual rate of growth was 3.7
per cent and, in the division of manufactures alone, 4.3 per cent. Let us
concentrate on the former figure and try to visualize what it means. In order
to do this we must first apply a correction: since the durable equipment of
industry was always increasing in relative importance, output available for
consumption cannot have increased at the same rate as total production. We
must allow for that. But I believe that an allowance of 1.7 per cent is ample; 5
thus we arrive at a rate of increase in “available output” of 2 per cent
(compound interest) per year.

Now suppose that the capitalist engine keeps on producing at that rate of
increase for another half century starting from 1928. To this assumption there
are various objections which will have to be noticed later on, but it cannot
be objected to on the ground that in the decade from 1929 to 1939 capitalism
had already failed to live up to that standard. For the depression that ran its
course from the last quarter of 1929 to the third quarter of 1932 does not
prove that a secular break has occurred in the propelling mechanism of
capitalist production because depressions of such severity have repeatedly
occurred—roughly once in fifty-five years—and because the effects of one
of them—the one from 1873 to 1877—are taken account of in the annual
average of 2 per cent. The subnormal recovery to 1935, the subnormal
prosperity to 1937 and the slump after that are easily accounted for by the
difficulties incident to the adaptation to a new fiscal policy, new labor
legislation and a general change in the attitude of government to private
enterprise all of which can, in a sense to be defined later, be distinguished
from the working of the productive apparatus as such.

Since misunderstandings at this point would be especially undesirable, I
wish to emphasize that the last sentence does not in itself imply either an
adverse criticism of the New Deal policies or the proposition—which I do
believe to be true but which I do not need just now—that policies of that
type are in the long run incompatible with the effective working of the
system of private enterprise. All I now mean to imply is that so extensive
and rapid a change of the social scene naturally affects productive
performance for a time, and so much the most ardent New Dealer must and
also can admit. I for one do not see how it would otherwise be possible to

account for the fact that this country which had the best chance of recovering
quickly was precisely the one to experience the most unsatisfactory recovery.
The only somewhat similar case, that of France, supports the same inference.
It follows that the course of events during the decade from 1929 to 1939 does
not per se constitute a valid reason for refusing to listen to the argument in
hand which, moreover, may in any case serve to illustrate the meaning of
past performance.

Well, if from 1928 on available production under the conditions of the
capitalist order continued to develop as it did before, i.e., at a long-run
average rate of increase of 2 per cent per year, it would after fifty years,
in 1978, reach an amount of roughly 2.7 (2.6916) times the 1928 figure.
In order to translate this into terms of average real income per head of
population, we first observe that our rate of increase in total output may
be roughly equated to the rate of increase in the sum total of private money
incomes available for consumption, 6 corrected for changes in the
purchasing power of the consumers’ dollars. Second, we must form an idea
about the increase in population we are to expect; we will choose Mr.
Sloane’s estimate, which gives 160 millions for 1978. Average income per
head during those fifty years would therefore increase to a little more than
double its 1928 amount, which was about $650, or to about $1300 of 1928
purchasing power. 7
<<<<<<< HEAD

Perhaps some readers feel that a proviso should be added about the
distribution of the total monetary income. Until about forty years ago,
many economists besides Marx believed that the capitalist process tended
to change relative shares in the national total so that the obvious
inference from our average might be invalidated by the rich growing
richer and the poor growing poorer, at least relatively. But there is no
such tendency. Whatever may be thought of the statistical measures
devised for the purpose, this much is certain: that the structure of the
pyramid of incomes, expressed in terms of money, has not greatly
changed during the period covered by our material—which for England

<!-- 6 “Consumption” includes the acquisition of durable consumers’ goods such as motor cars,
refrigerators and homes. We do not distinguish between transient consumers’ goods and what
is sometimes referred to as “consumers’ capital.”

7 That is to say, average real income per head would increase at a compound interest rate
of 1? per cent. It so happens that in England, during the century preceding the First World War,
real income per head of population increased at almost exactly that rate (see Lord Stamp in
Wealth and Taxable Capacity). No great confidence can be placed in this coincidence. But I
think it serves to show that our little calculation is not wildly absurd. In Number 241 of the
National Industrial Conference Board Studies, Table I, pp. 6 and 7, we find that “per capita
realized national income” adjusted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the National
Industrial Conference Board cost of living index, was in 1929 a little over four times the 1829
figure—a similar result, though open to still more serious doubts as to reliability. -->

includes the whole of the nineteenth century 8 —and that the relative share
of wages plus salaries has also been substantially constant over time.
There is, so long as we are discussing what the capitalist engine might
do if left to itself, no reason to believe that the distribution of incomes
or the dispersion about our average would in 1978 be significantly
different from what it was in 1928.

One way of expressing our result is that, if capitalism repeated its past
performance for another half century starting with 1928, this would do away
with anything that according to present standards could be called poverty,
even in the lowest strata of the population, pathological cases alone excepted.
Nor is this all. Whatever else our index may do or may not do, it
certainly does not overstate the actual rate of increase. It does not take
account of the commodity, Voluntary Leisure. New commodities escape
or are inadequately represented by an index which must rest largely on
basic commodities and intermediate products. For the same reason
improvements in quality almost completely fail to assert themselves
although they constitute, in many lines, the core of the progress
achieved—there is no way of expressing adequately the difference
between a motorcar of 1940 and a motorcar of 1900 or the extent to
which the price of motorcars per unit of utility has fallen. 

It would be
more nearly possible to estimate the rate at which given quantities of
raw materials or semi-finished products are made to go further than
they used to—a steel ingot or a ton of coal, though they may be
unchanged in physical quality, represent a multiple of their economic
efficiency sixty years ago. But little has been done along this line. I
have no idea about what would happen to our index if there were a
method for correcting it for these and similar factors. It is certain,
however, that its percentage rate of change would be increased and that
we have here a reserve that should make the estimate adopted proof
against the effects of any conceivable downward revision. Moreover,
even if we had the means of measuring the change in the technological
efficiency of industrial products, this measure would still fail to convey
an adequate idea of what it means for the dignity or intensity or
pleasantness of human life—for all that the economists of an earlier
generation subsumed under the heading of Satisfaction of Wants. And
this, after all, is for us the relevant consideration, the true “output” of
8 See Stamp, op. cit. The same phenomenon can be observed in all countries for which there
is sufficient statistical information, if we clear the latter of the disturbing effect of the cycles
of various span that are covered by the available material. The measure of income distribution
(or of inequality of incomes) devised by Vilfredo Pareto is open to objection. But the fact itself
is independent of its shortcomings.

capitalist production, the reason why we are interested in the index of
production and the pounds and gallons that enter into it and would
hardly be worth while in themselves.

Relative shares in national income have remained
substantially constant over the last hundred years. This, however, is true
only if we measure them in money. Measured in real terms, relative shares
have substantially changed in favor of the lower income groups. This
follows from the fact that the capitalist engine is first and last an engine
of mass production which unavoidably means also production for the
masses, whereas, climbing upward in the scale of individual incomes, we
find that an increasing proportion is being spent on personal services and
on handmade commodities, the prices of which are largely a function of
wage rates.

Verification is easy. There are no doubt some things available to the
modern workman that Louis XIV himself would have been delighted to
have yet was unable to have—modern dentistry for instance. On the whole,
however, a budget on that level had little that really mattered to gain from
capitalist achievement. Even speed of traveling may be assumed to have
been a minor consideration for so very dignified a gentleman. Electric
lighting is no great boon to anyone who has money enough to buy a
sufficient number of candles and to pay servants to attend to them. It is
the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and
so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as
a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen
Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not
typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in
bringing them within the reach of factory girls in return for steadily
decreasing amounts of effort.

The same fact stands out still better if we glance at those long waves in
economic activity, analysis of which reveals the nature and mechanism of
the capitalist process better than anything else. Each of them consists of an
“industrial revolution” and the absorption of its effects. For instance, we are
able to observe statistically and historically—the phenomenon is so clear that
even our scanty information suffices to establish it—the rise of such a long
wave toward the end of the 1780’s, its culmination around 1800, its
downward sweep and then a sort of recovery ending at the beginning of the
1840’s. This was the Industrial Revolution dear to the heart of textbook
writers. Upon its heels, however, came another such revolution producing
another long wave that rose in the forties, culminated just before 1857 and ebbed away to 1897, to be followed in turn by the one that reached its peak
about 1911 and is now in the act of ebbing away. 9

These revolutions periodically reshape the existing structure of industry
by introducing new methods of production—the mechanized factory, the
electrified factory, chemical synthesis and the like; new commodities, such
as railroad service, motorcars, electrical appliances; new forms of
organization—the merger movement; new sources of supply—La Plata wool,
American cotton, Katanga copper; new trade routes and markets to sell in
and so on. This process of industrial change provides the ground swell that
gives the general tone to business: while these things are being initiated we
have brisk expenditure and predominating “prosperity”—interrupted, no
doubt, by the negative phases of the shorter cycles that are superimposed on
that ground swell—and while those things are being completed and their
results pour forth we have elimination of antiquated elements of the
industrial structure and predominating “depression.” Thus there are
prolonged periods of rising and of falling prices, interest rates, employment
and so on, which phenomena constitute parts of the mechanism of this
process of recurrent rejuvenation of the productive apparatus.
Now these results each time consist in an avalanche of consumers’ goods
that permanently deepens and widens the stream of real income although in
the first instance they spell disturbance, losses and unemployment. And if
we look at those avalanches of consumers’ goods we again find that each
of them consists in articles of mass consumption and increases the
purchasing power of the wage dollar more than that of any other dollar—in
other words, that the capitalist process, not by coincidence but by virtue of
its mechanism, progressively raises the standard of life of the masses. It does
so through a sequence: of vicissitudes, the severity of which is proportional
to the speed of the advance. But it does so effectively. One problem after
another of the supply of commodities to the masses has been successfully
solved 10 by being brought within the reach of the methods of capitalist
production. The most important one of those that remain, housing, is
approaching solution by means of the pre-fabricated house.
And still this is not all. Appraisal of an economic order would be
incomplete—and incidentally un-Marxian—if it stopped at the output which
the corresponding economic conveyor hands to the various groups of society
and left out of account all those things that the conveyor does not serve

<!-- 9 These are the “long waves” which, in business cycle literature, are primarily associated
with the name of N.D.Kondratieff.

which was entirely the work of large-scale capitalist enterprise (railroads, shipping, agricultural
machinery, fertilizers). -->

directly but for which it provides the means as well as the political volition,
and all those cultural achievements that are induced by the mentality it
generates. Deferring consideration of the latter (Chapter XI), we shall now
turn to some aspects of the former.

The technique and atmosphere of the struggle for social legislation
obscures the otherwise obvious facts that, on the one hand, part of this
legislation presupposes previous capitalist success (in other words, wealth
which had previously to be created by capitalist enterprise) and that, on
the other hand, much of what social legislation develops and generalizes
had been previously initiated by the action of the capitalist stratum itself.
Both facts must of course be added to the sum total of capitalist
performance. Now if the system had another run such as it had in the
sixty years preceding 1928 and really reached the $1300 per head of
population, it is easy to see that all the desiderata that have so far been
espoused by any social reformers—practically without exception,
including even the greater part of the cranks—either would be fulfilled
automatically or could be fulfilled without significant interference with
the capitalist process. Ample provision for the unemployed in particular
would then be not only a tolerable but a light burden. Irresponsibility in
creating unemployment and in financing the support of the unemployed
might of course at any time create insoluble problems. But managed with
ordinary prudence, an average annual expenditure of 16 billions on an
average number of 16 million unemployed including dependents (10 per
cent of the population) would not in itself be a serious matter with an
available national income of the order of magnitude of 200 billion dollars
(purchasing power of 1928).

May I call the reader’s attention to the reason why unemployment which
everyone agrees must be one of the most important issues in any discussion
of capitalism—with some critics so much so that they base their indictment
exclusively on this element of the case—will play a comparatively small
role in my argument? I do not think that unemployment is among those
evils which, like poverty, capitalist evolution could ever eliminate of itself.
I also do not think that there is any tendency for the unemployment
percentage to increase in the long run. The only series covering a
respectable time interval—roughly the sixty years preceding the First
World War—gives the English trade-union percentage of unemployed
members. It is a typically cyclical series and displays no trend (or a
11 That series has often been charted and analyzed. See for instance, A.C.Pigou. Industrial
Fluctuations or my Business Cycles. For every country there seems to be an irreducible
minimum and, superimposed on that, a cyclical movement, the strongest component of which
has a period of about nine to ten years.

horizontal one). 11 Since this is theoretically understandable—there is no
theoretical reason to call the evidence in question—those two propositions
seem established for the prewar time to 1913 inclusive. In the postwar time
and in most countries unemployment was mostly at an abnormally high
level even before 1930. But this and still more the unemployment during
the thirties can be accounted for on grounds that have nothing to do with
a long-run tendency of unemployment percentages to increase from causes
inherent in the capitalist mechanism itself. I have mentioned above those
industrial revolutions which are so characteristic of the capitalist process.
Supernormal unemployment is one of the features of the periods of
adaptation that follow upon the “prosperity phase” of each of them. We
observe it in the 1820’s and 1870’s, and the period after 1920 is simply
another of those periods. So far the phenomenon is essentially temporary
in the sense that nothing can be inferred about it for the future. But there
were a number of other factors which tended to intensify it—war effects,
dislocations of foreign trade, wage policies, certain institutional changes
that swelled the statistical figure, in England and Germany fiscal policies
(also important in the United States since 1935) and so on. Some of these
are no doubt symptoms of an “atmosphere” in which capitalism will work
with decreasing efficiency. That however is another matter which will
engage our attention later on.

But whether lasting or temporary, getting worse or not, unemployment
undoubtedly is and always has been a scourge. In the next part of this book
we shall have to list its possible elimination among the claims of the
socialist order to superiority. Nevertheless, I hold that the real tragedy is
not unemployment per se, but unemployment plus the impossibility of
providing adequately for the unemployed without impairing the conditions
of further economic development: for obviously the suffering and
degradation—the destruction of human values—which we associate with
unemployment, though not the waste of productive resources, would be
largely eliminated and unemployment would lose practically all its terror
if the private life of the unemployed were not seriously affected by their
unemployment. The indictment stands that in the past—say, roughly, to the
end of the nineteenth century—the capitalist order was not only unwilling
but also quite incapable of guaranteeing this. But since it will be able to
do so if it keeps up its past performance for another half century this
indictment would in that case enter the limbo filled by the sorry specters
of child labor and sixteen-hour working days and five persons living in one
room which it is quite proper to emphasize when we are talking about the
past social costs of capitalist achievement but which are not necessarily
relevant to the balance of alternatives for the future. Our own time is somewhere between the disabilities of earlier stages in capitalist evolution
and the abilities of the system in full maturity. In this country at least, the
better part of the task could even now be accomplished without undue
strain on the system. The difficulties do not seem to consist so much in
the lack of a surplus sufficient to blot out the darkest hues in the picture:
they consist, on the one hand, in the fact that the unemployment figure has
been increased by anti-capitalist policies beyond what it need have been
in the thirties and, on the other hand, in the fact that public opinion as soon
as it becomes at all alive to the duty in question, immediately insists on
economically irrational methods of financing relief and on lax and wasteful
methods of administering it.

Much the same argument applies to the future—and to a great extent the
present—possibilities held out by capitalist evolution for the care of the aged
and sick, for education and hygiene and so on. Also, an increasing number
of commodities might reasonably be expected, from the standpoint of the
individual household, to pass out of the class of economic goods and to be
available practically up to the satiety point. This could be brought about
either by arrangements between public agencies and producing concerns or
by nationalization or municipalization, gradual progress with which would
of course be a feature of the future development even of an otherwise
unfettered capitalism.
