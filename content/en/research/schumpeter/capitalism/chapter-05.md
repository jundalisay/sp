PART II Can Capitalism Survive?
 
PROLOGUE

CAN capitalism survive? No. I do not think it can. But this opinion of
mine, like that of every other economist who has pronounced upon the
subject, is in itself completely uninteresting. What counts in any attempt at
social prognosis is not the Yes or No that sums up the facts and arguments
which lead up to it but those facts and arguments themselves. They contain
all that is scientific in the final result. Everything else is not science but
prophecy. Analysis, whether economic or other, never yields more than a
statement about the tendencies present in an observable pattern. And these
never tell us what will happen to the pattern but only what would happen if
they continued to act as they have been acting in the time interval covered
by our observation and if no other factors intruded. “Inevitability” or
“necessity” can never mean more than this.
What follows must be read with that proviso. But there are other
limitations to our results and their reliability. The process of social life is
a function of so many variables many of which are not amenable to
anything like measurement that even mere diagnosis of a given state of
things becomes a doubtful matter quite apart from the formidable sources
of error that open up as soon as we attempt prognosis. These difficulties
should not be exaggerated, however. We shall see that the dominant traits
of the picture clearly support certain inferences which, whatever the
qualifications that may have to be added, are too strong to be neglected
on the ground that they cannot be proved in the sense in which a
proposition of Euclid’s can.

One more point before we start. The thesis I shall endeavor to establish
is that the actual and prospective performance of the capitalist system is
such as to negative the idea of its breaking down under the weight of
economic failure, but that its very success undermines the social
institutions which protect it, and “inevitably” creates conditions in which
it will not be able to live and which strongly point to socialism as the heir
apparent. My final conclusion therefore does not differ, however much my
argument may, from that of most socialist writers and in particular from
that of all Marxists. But in order to accept it one does not need to be a
socialist. Prognosis does not imply anything about the desirability of the
course of events that one predicts. If a doctor predicts that his patient will
die presently, this does not mean that he desires it. One may hate socialism or at least look upon it with cool criticism, and yet foresee its advent. Many conservatives did and do.

Nor need one accept this conclusion in order to qualify as a socialist. One
may love socialism and ardently believe in its economic, cultural and ethical
superiority but nevertheless believe at the same time that capitalist society
does not harbor any tendency toward self-destruction. There are in fact
socialists who believe that the capitalist order is gathering strength and is
entrenching itself as time goes on, so that it is chimerical to hope for its
breakdown.



CHAPTER V
THE RATE OF INCREASE OF TOTAL OUTPUT
T HE atmosphere of hostility to capitalism which we shall have to explain
presently makes it much more difficult than it otherwise would be to
form a rational opinion about its economic and cultural performance. The
public mind has by now so thoroughly grown out of humor with it as to
make condemnation of capitalism and all its works a foregone conclusion—
almost a requirement of the etiquette of discussion. Whatever his political
preference, every writer or speaker hastens to conform to this code and to
emphasize his critical attitude, his freedom from “complacency,” his belief
in the inadequacies of capitalist achievement, his aversion to capitalist and
his sympathy with anti-capitalist interests. Any other attitude is voted not
only foolish but anti-social and is looked upon as an indication of immoral
servitude. This is of course perfectly natural. New social religions will
always have that effect. Only it does not make it easier to fulfill the analyst’s
task: in 300 A.D. it would not have been easy to expound the achievements
of ancient civilization to a fervent believer in Christianity. On the one hand,
the most obvious truths are simply put out of court a limine;1 on the other
hand, the most obvious misstatements are borne with or applauded.
A first test of economic performance is total output, the total of all the
commodities and services produced in a unit of time—a year or a quarter
of a year or a month. Economists try to measure variations in this quantity
by means of indices derived from a number of series representing the output
of individual commodities. “Strict logic is a stern master, and if one
respected it, one would never construct or use any production index,” 2 for
not only the material and the technique of constructing such an index, but
the very concept of a total output of different commodities produced in ever-
changing proportions, is a highly doubtful matter. 3 Nevertheless, I believe
that this device is sufficiently reliable to give us a general idea.

<!-- 1 There is however another method of dealing with obvious though uncomfortable truth, viz.,
the method of sneering at its triviality. Such a sneer will serve as well as a refutation would,
for the average audience is as a rule perfectly unaware of the fact that it often covers the
impossibility of denial—a pretty specimen of social psychology.
2 A.F.Burns, Production Trends in the United States Since 1870, p. 262.
3 We cannot enter into this problem here. A little will, however, be said about it when
we meet it again in the next chapter. For a fuller treatment see my book on Business
Cycles, ch. ix. -->

For the United States, individual series good and numerous enough to
warrant construction of such an index of output are available since the Civil
War. Choosing what is known as the Day-Persons index of total production 4
we find that, from 1870 to 1930, the average annual rate of growth was 3.7
per cent and, in the division of manufactures alone, 4.3 per cent. Let us
concentrate on the former figure and try to visualize what it means. In order
to do this we must first apply a correction: since the durable equipment of
industry was always increasing in relative importance, output available for
consumption cannot have increased at the same rate as total production. We
must allow for that. But I believe that an allowance of 1.7 per cent is ample; 5
thus we arrive at a rate of increase in “available output” of 2 per cent
(compound interest) per year.

Now suppose that the capitalist engine keeps on producing at that rate of
increase for another half century starting from 1928. To this assumption there
are various objections which will have to be noticed later on, but it cannot
be objected to on the ground that in the decade from 1929 to 1939 capitalism
had already failed to live up to that standard. For the depression that ran its
course from the last quarter of 1929 to the third quarter of 1932 does not
prove that a secular break has occurred in the propelling mechanism of
capitalist production because depressions of such severity have repeatedly
occurred—roughly once in fifty-five years—and because the effects of one
of them—the one from 1873 to 1877—are taken account of in the annual
average of 2 per cent. The subnormal recovery to 1935, the subnormal
prosperity to 1937 and the slump after that are easily accounted for by the
difficulties incident to the adaptation to a new fiscal policy, new labor
legislation and a general change in the attitude of government to private
enterprise all of which can, in a sense to be defined later, be distinguished
from the working of the productive apparatus as such.

Since misunderstandings at this point would be especially undesirable, I
wish to emphasize that the last sentence does not in itself imply either an
adverse criticism of the New Deal policies or the proposition—which I do
believe to be true but which I do not need just now—that policies of that
type are in the long run incompatible with the effective working of the
system of private enterprise. All I now mean to imply is that so extensive
and rapid a change of the social scene naturally affects productive
performance for a time, and so much the most ardent New Dealer must and
also can admit. I for one do not see how it would otherwise be possible to
account for the fact that this country which had the best chance of recovering
quickly was precisely the one to experience the most unsatisfactory recovery.
The only somewhat similar case, that of France, supports the same inference.
It follows that the course of events during the decade from 1929 to 1939 does
not per se constitute a valid reason for refusing to listen to the argument in
hand which, moreover, may in any case serve to illustrate the meaning of
past performance.

<!-- 4 See W.M.Persons, Forecasting Business Cycles, ch. xi.
5 That allowance is in fact absurdly large. See also Professor F.C.Mill’s estimate of 3.1 per
cent for the period 1901–1913, and of 3.8 per cent for the period 1922–1929 (construction
excluded; Economic Tendencies in the United States, 1932). -->



Well, if from 1928 on available production under the conditions of the
capitalist order continued to develop as it did before, i.e., at a long-run
average rate of increase of 2 per cent per year, it would after fifty years,
in 1978, reach an amount of roughly 2.7 (2.6916) times the 1928 figure.
In order to translate this into terms of average real income per head of
population, we first observe that our rate of increase in total output may
be roughly equated to the rate of increase in the sum total of private money
incomes available for consumption, 6 corrected for changes in the
purchasing power of the consumers’ dollars. Second, we must form an idea
about the increase in population we are to expect; we will choose Mr.
Sloane’s estimate, which gives 160 millions for 1978. Average income per
head during those fifty years would therefore increase to a little more than
double its 1928 amount, which was about $650, or to about $1300 of 1928
purchasing power. 7
