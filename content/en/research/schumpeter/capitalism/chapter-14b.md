3. In order to realize what all this means for the efficiency of the capitalist engine of production we need only recall that the family and the family home used to be the mainspring of the typically bourgeois kind of profit motive.

Economists have not always given due weight to this fact. When we look more
closely at their idea of the self-interest of entrepreneurs and capitalists we cannot
fail to discover that the results it was supposed to produce are really not at all
what one would expect from the rational self-interest of the detached individual
or the childless couple who no longer look at the world through the windows
of a family home. Consciously or unconsciously they analyzed the behavior of
the man whose views and motives are shaped by such a home and who means
to work and to save primarily for wife and children. As soon as these fade out
from the moral vision of the businessman, we have a different kind of homo
oeconomicus before us who cares for different things and acts in different ways.

For him and from the standpoint of his individualistic utilitarianism, the behavior
of that old type would in fact be completely irrational. He loses the only sort of
romance and heroism that is left in the unromantic and unheroic civilization of
capitalism—the heroism of navigare necesse est, vivere non necesse est.4 

He loses the capitalist ethics that enjoins working for the future irrespective of
whether or not one is going to harvest the crop oneself.

The last point may be put more tellingly. In the preceding chapter it was
observed that the capitalist order entrusts the long-run interests of society to
the upper strata of the bourgeoisie. They are really entrusted to the family
motive operative in those strata. The bourgeoisie worked primarily in order
to invest, and it was not so much a standard of consumption as a standard
of accumulation that the bourgeoisie struggled for and tried to defend against
governments that took the short-run view. 5 With the decline of the driving
power supplied by the family motive, the businessman’s time-horizon
shrinks, roughly, to his life expectation. And he might now be less willing
than he was to fulfill that function of earning, saving and investing even if
he saw no reason to fear that the results would but swell his tax bills.

He drifts into an anti-saving frame of mind and accepts with an increasing
readiness anti-saving theories that are indicative of a short-run philosophy.
But anti-saving theories are not all that he accepts. With a different
attitude to the concern he works for and with a different scheme of private
life he tends to acquire a different view of the values and standards of the
capitalist order of things. Perhaps the most striking feature of the picture is
the extent to which the bourgeoisie, besides educating its own enemies,
allows itself in turn to be educated by them. It absorbs the slogans of current
radicalism and seems quite willing to undergo a process of conversion to a
creed hostile to its very existence. Haltingly and grudgingly it concedes in
part the implications of that creed. This would be most astonishing and
indeed very hard to explain were it not for the fact that the typical bourgeois
is rapidly losing faith in his own creed. And this again becomes fully
understandable as soon as we realize that the social conditions which account
for its emergence are passing.

This is verified by the very characteristic manner in which particular
capitalist interests and the bourgeoisie as a whole behave when facing direct
attack. They talk and plead—or hire people to do it for them; they snatch at
every chance of compromise; they are ever ready to give in; they never put
up a fight under the flag of their own ideals and interests—in this country
there was no real resistance anywhere against the imposition of crushing
financial burdens during the last decade or against labor legislation
incompatible with the effective management of industry. Now, as the reader
will surely know by this time, I am far from overestimating the political
power of either big business or the bourgeoisie in general. Moreover, I am
prepared to make large allowances for cowardice. But still, means of defense
were not entirely lacking as yet and history is full of examples of the success
of small groups who, believing in their cause, were resolved to stand by their
guns. The only explanation for the meekness we observe is that the bourgeois
order no longer makes any sense to the bourgeoisie itself and that, when all
is said and nothing is done, it does not really care.

excepting certain matters outside of party politics such as conservation of natural resources, it
hardly ever does. -->


Thus the same economic process that undermines the position of the bourgeoisie by decreasing the importance of the functions of entrepreneurs and capitalists, by breaking up protective strata and institutions, by creating
an atmosphere of hostility, also decomposes the motor forces of capitalism
from within. Nothing else shows so well that the capitalist order not only
rests on props made of extra-capitalist material but also derives its energy
from extra-capitalist patterns of behavior which at the same time it is bound
to destroy.

We have rediscovered what from different standpoints and, so I believe,
on inadequate grounds has often been discovered before: there is inherent
in the capitalist system a tendency toward self-destruction which, in its
earlier stages, may well assert itself in the form of a tendency toward
retardation of progress.

I shall not stay to repeat how objective and subjective, economic and
extra-economic factors, reinforcing each other in imposing accord, contribute
to that result. Nor shall I stay to show what should be obvious and in
subsequent chapters will become more obvious still, viz., that those factors
make not only for the destruction of the capitalist but for the emergence of
a socialist civilization. They all point in that direction. The capitalist process
not only destroys its own institutional framework but it also creates the
conditions for another. Destruction may not be the right word after all.
Perhaps I should have spoken of transformation. The outcome of the process
is not simply a void that could be filled by whatever might happen to turn
up; things and souls are transformed in such a way as to become increasingly
amenable to the socialist form of life. With every peg from under the
capitalist structure vanishes an impossibility of the socialist plan. In both
these respects Marx’s vision was right. We can also agree with him in linking
the particular social transformation that goes on under our eyes with an
economic process as its prime mover. What our analysis, if correct, disproves
is after all of secondary importance, however essential the role may be which
it plays in the socialist credo. In the end there is not so much difference as
one might think between saying that the decay of capitalism is due to its
success and saying that it is due to its failure.
But our answer to the question that heads this part posits far more
problems than it solves. 

1. So far we have not learned anything about the kind of socialism that may be looming in the future.

Marx and for most of his followers—
and this was and is one of the most serious shortcomings of their doctrine—
socialism meant just one definite thing. But the definiteness really goes no
further than nationalization of industry would carry us and with this an
indefinite variety of economic and cultural possibilities will be seen to be
compatible.

2. We know nothing as yet about the precise way by
which socialism may be expected to come except that there must be a great
many possibilities ranging from a gradual bureaucratization to the most
picturesque revolution. 

Strictly speaking we do not even know whether
socialism will actually come to stay. For to repeat: perceiving a tendency and
visualizing the goal of it is one thing and predicting that this goal will
actually be reached and that the resulting state of things will be workable,
let alone permanent, is quite another thing. Before humanity chokes (or
basks) in the dungeon (or paradise) of socialism it may well burn up in the
horrors (or glories) of imperialist wars. 6

3. The various components of the tendency we have been trying
to describe, while everywhere discernible, have as yet nowhere fully revealed
themselves. 

Things have gone to different lengths in different countries but
in no country far enough to allow us to say with any confidence precisely
how far they will go, or to assert that their “underlying trend” has grown too
strong to be subject to anything more serious than temporary reverses.

Industrial integration is far from being complete. Competition, actual and
potential, is still a major factor in any business situation. Enterprise is still
active, the leadership of the bourgeois group still the prime mover of the
economic process. The middle class is still a political power. Bourgeois
standards and bourgeois motivations though being increasingly impaired are
still alive. Survival of traditions—and family ownership of controlling parcels
of stock—still make many an executive behave as the owner-manager did
of old. The bourgeois family has not yet died; in fact, it clings to life so
tenaciously that no responsible politician has as yet dared to touch it by any
method other than taxation. From the standpoint of immediate practice as
well as for the purposes of shortrun forecasting—and in these things, a
century is a “short run” 7
—all this surface may be more important than the
tendency toward another civilization that slowly works deep down below.

7 This is why the facts and arguments presented in this and the two preceding chapters do
not invalidate my reasoning about the possible economic results of another fifty years of
capitalist evolution. The thirties may well turn out to have been the last gasp of capitalism—
the likelihood of this is of course greatly increased by the current war. But again they may not.
In any case there are no purely economic reasons why capitalism should not have another
successful run which is all I wished to establish. -->
