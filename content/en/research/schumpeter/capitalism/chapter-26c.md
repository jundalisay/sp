<!-- III. SOCIALIST GROUPS In the UNITED STATES -->

In the United States a totally different social pattern proved as
unfavorable as was the Russian to the growth of a genuinely socialist
mass movement. Thus the two cases present similarities that are no less
interesting than the differences. 

If the agrarian world of Russia, in spite
of the streak of communism inherent in the structure of the Russian
village, was practically impervious to the influence of modern
socialism, the agrarian world of the United States provided an anti-
socialist force that stood ready to make short work of any activities on
Marxist lines important enough to be noticed by it. If the industrial
sector of Russia failed to produce a significant socialist mass party
because capitalist evolution was so sluggish, the industrial sector of the
United States failed to do so because capitalist evolution rushed on at
such a vertiginous pace. 11

The most important difference was between the respective intellectual
groups: unlike Russia, the United States did not, until the end of the
nineteenth century, produce an under-employed and frustrated set of
intellectuals. The scheme of values that arose from the national task of
developing the economic possibilities of the country drew nearly all the
brains into business and impressed the businessman’s attitudes upon the soul
of the nation. Outside of New York, intellectuals in our sense were not
numerous enough to count. Most of them moreover accepted this scheme of
values. If they did not. Main Street refused to listen and instinctively frowned
upon them, and this was much more effective in disciplining them than were
the methods of the Russian political police. Middle-class hostility to
railroads, utilities and big business in general absorbed almost all there was
of “revolutionary” energy.

The average competent and respectable workman was, and felt himself
to be, a businessman. He successfully applied himself to exploiting his own
individual opportunities, to getting on or, in any case, to selling his labor
as advantageously as possible. He understood and largely shared his
employer’s way of thinking. When he found it useful to ally himself with
his peers within the same concern, he did so in the same spirit. Since
roughly the middle of the nineteenth century this practice increasingly took
adequate as the result of his supreme ability in handling them. In this respect, though in no
other, Professor Laski’s proskynesis in the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (article
Ulyanov) is fully understandable, provided of course that intellectuals must prostrate themselves
before the idols of their time.

<!-- 11 The presence of the “frontier” of course greatly reduced the possibilities of friction. The
importance of this element, though great, is however likely to be over-estimated. That pace of
industrial evolution incessantly created new industrial frontiers, and this fact was much more
important than was the opportunity of packing one’s bags and going west. -->

the form of employees’ committees, the forerunners of the postwar
company unions that acquired their full economic and cultural significance
in company towns. 12

Beyond that, it was frequently good business for the workman to combine
on a national scale with the other members of his craft in order further to
improve his bargaining position as against employers directly and as against
other crafts indirectly. This interest shaped many trade unions that are
typically American, largely accounts for the adoption of the craft principle
which is much more effective than any other principle can be in keeping
away would-be entrants, and really produced workmen’s cartels. Naturally
enough, these cartels displayed that lack of radicalism which was and is so
eloquently lamented by both domestic and foreign socialists and fellow
travelers. 

Nothing but wage rates and hours mattered to them and they were
quite prepared to study the wishes of the public or even of the employers in
everything else, particularly in their phraseology. This is illustrated to
perfection by the type and behavior of the leaders both of individual unions
and of the American Federation of Labor which embodied that spirit, as well
as by the attempts of the trade-union bureaucracy to enter, with trade-union
funds, the sphere of industrial and financial enterprise that was quite
congenial to them. 13


<!-- 12 The common sense of the arrangement and its particular suitability to American conditions
are as obvious as is the fact that it was a thorn in the flesh of trade unions and also of the radical
intellectuals of a later type. The slogans of our days—recently officialized—have thus
stigmatized company unions as the product of a diabolical attempt by employers to thwart the
efforts toward effective representation of the workmen’s interests. While this view too is
perfectly understandable from a standpoint from which militant organization of the proletariat
is in the nature of a moral axiom—and from the standpoint of the corporative state that grows
up before our eyes—it vitiates historical interpretation. The fact that employers provided
facilities for this type of organization, often took the initiative and tried to influence it so as to
be able to get along with it, does not exclude or disprove the other fact that company unions
and their forerunners fulfilled a much-needed function and that, in the normal case, they served
the interests of the men quite well.

13 The figure of Warren Sanford Stone, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, affords
an excellent (though later) illustration of the last-mentioned aspect as well as of the others.
Further examples from the time of Samuel Gompers will so readily occur to the reader that
there is no need of mentioning them. But the above should not be interpreted to mean that the
trade union with high entrance fees and long waiting lists which looks so strangely like a copper
corner is or was the only kind of trade union in this country. On the contrary, immigrants
imported every European variety, and, irrespective of this, forms similar to those found in
Europe developed where conditions were favorable, that is, especially in the relatively old and
consolidated locations and branches of industry. -->

To be sure, the fact that the creeds and slogans—the ideologies—were so
unrevolutionary and so averse to class war is in itself of limited importance.
American trade unionists were not much given to theorizing. If they had been
they might have put a Marxist interpretation upon their practice. It remains true however that, bargaining aside, they did not consider themselves on the
other side of the fence in all things and that cooperation—which those of
us who do not like it will call collusion—with employers was in accord not
only with their principles but also with the logic of their situation. Beyond
a narrow range of questions, political action was not only unnecessary but
even meaningless to them. And for the influence he was able to exert, the
radical intellectual might just as well have tried to convert the board of the
Pennsylvania Railroad.

But there was another world within the world of American labor. Along
with elements of supernormal quality, immigration included from the first
some substandard ones also which increased in relative as well as absolute
numbers after the Civil War. These numbers were swelled by individuals who,
though not subnormal as to physical fitness or intelligence or energy, yet
gravitated into that group, owing to past misfortunes or to the persistence of
the influence of the unfavorable environments from which they sprang or
simply owing to restlessness, inadaptable temperament or criminal proclivities.
All these types were an easy prey to exploitation which was facilitated by the
absence of moral bonds, and some of them reacted by a blind and impulsive
hatred that readily crystallized into crime. In many new and rapidly growing
industrial communities where people of the most varied origins and
propensities were thrown together and law and order had to be kept, if at all,
by action that was itself outside of the law, rough people, made still rougher
by the treatment they received, faced employers, or agents of employers, who
had not yet developed a sense of responsibility and were often driven to brutal
courses by a fear not only for their property but also for their lives.
There, so the socialist observer is inclined to say, was class war in the
most literal sense—actual guns going off to illustrate the Marxist concept.
As a matter of fact, it was nothing of the sort. It is hard to imagine any
set of conditions less favorable to the development of political laborism or
of serious socialism, and very little of either showed as long as those
conditions lasted.

The history of the Knights of Labor, the one really important and nation-
wide organization of all wageworkers regardless of skill or craft—and in fact
of all who cared to join—covers about a decade of significant power and
activity (1878–1889). In 1886 the Noble Order’s membership was almost
700,000. The part of it which consisted of industrial—mainly unskilled—
laborers energetically participated in or even initiated the strikes or boycotts
that accompanied the depressions of that time. A scrutiny of programs and
pronouncements reveals a somewhat incoherent medley of all sorts of
socialist, cooperative and, occasionally, anarchist ideas that we can trace, if
we wish, to a wide variety of sources—Owen, the English agrarian socialists, Marx, and the Fabians among them. The political point of view was much in evidence and so was the idea of general planning and of social
reconstruction. But such definiteness of aims as we may discover is really
due to our reading back from the standpoint of our own time. In reality there
were no definite aims and it was precisely the comprehensive character of
the ideology of the Good Life—Uriah S.Stephens, the founder, had been
trained for the ministry—and of the American Constitution which appealed
to so many people, farmers and professional men included. The Order thus
was a sort of exchange for the plans of all kinds of reformers. In this respect
it indeed filled a function which its leaders had in mind when they stressed
the educational aspect of its activities. But an organization formed of such
different clays was constitutionally incapable of action. When definitely
socialist profession was insisted on, it broke. Similar movements (Populists,
Henry George’s and others) tell the same tale.

The obvious inference is that in the American environment of that time
there was not and could not be either the requisite material or the requisite
motive power for a socialist mass movement. This can be verified by following
the thread that leads from the Knights to the Industrial Workers of the World.
This thread is embodied in the career of a Marxist intellectual, Daniel De Leon,
and hence should have, for the faithful, considerable specific weight.14 It was
under his command that, in 1893, socialists within the Order of the Knights
rose against the old leader, Powderly, thereby, as it turned out, dealing a death
blow to the organization. The idea was to create an instrument for political
action on more or less Marxian lines. Class war, revolution, destruction of the
capitalist state and the rest of it were to be sponsored by a proletarian party.
But neither the Socialist Labor Party (1890) nor De Leon’s Socialist Trade and
Labor Alliance (1895) had any life in it. Not only was the working-class
following small—this would not in itself have been decisive—but success even
of the Russian kind, that is to say, conquest of a controlling nucleus of
intellectuals, was not attained. The Socialist Labor party first split and then lost
most of the remaining ground to the new Socialist party.

The latter came as near to being an orthodox success as any group did in
this country. To begin with, its origin was orthodox. It arose from the labor
struggles during 1892–1894, when strikes were broken by the use of force,
the federal government and the judiciary lending resolute support to the

<!-- 14 All the more so as Lenin himself went out of his way to pay homage, quite unusual for
him, to De Leon’s work and thought. -->

15 It will be observed that this was done at a time when most European governments were
rapidly adopting another attitude. However, this does not simply spell “backwardness” on this
side of the Atlantic. It is true that the social and political prestige of the business interest was
here much greater than anywhere else and that American democracy in consequence took a
much narrower view of labor problems than did, say, the Junker government in Prussia. But
employers. 15 This converted many a man who had been previously a
“conservative” craft unionist. At any rate, it converted Eugene V. Debs first
to industrial unionism and then to the principle of political action. Secondly,
the general attitude adopted by the Socialist party was orthodox. It tried to
work with and to “bore from within” the trade unions. It gave itself a regular
political organization. It was in principle revolutionary in the same sense as
were the great socialist parties of Europe. Its doctrine was not quite orthodox.

In fact it did not stress doctrinal aspects to any great extent—either under
Debs or later—and it allowed considerable latitude to the teaching activities
within its ranks. But though it never succeeded in absorbing the little local
labor parties that kept on cropping up all over the country, it developed fairly
well up to the postwar period when communist competition asserted itself.

A majority of socialists would, I think, agree in calling it the one genuine
socialist party of this country. Its voting strength, though swelled as that of
most socialist parties is by non-socialist sympathizers, measures the scope
there was for serious socialist effort.

De Leon however had another chance. It came from—and went with—the Western Federation of Miners whose radicalism, quite independent of any
doctrinal background, was nothing but the product of rough people reacting
to a rough environment. This union provided the corner stone for the
structure of the I.W.W. (1905). De Leon and his, associates added the
wreckage of their own and other unsuccessful organizations as well as
splinters mostly of dubious character—intellectual or proletarian or both—
from everywhere and nowhere. But the leadership—and in consequence the
phraseology—was strong. Besides De Leon himself, there were Haywood,
Trautmann, Foster and others.

Shock tactics that knew no inhibitions and the spirit of uncompromising
warfare account for a series of isolated successes, and the absence of
anything else but phrases and shock tactics, for the ultimate failure that was
hastened by quarrels with and defections to the communists as well as by
incessant internal dissensions. But I need not retell a story that has been told
so often from every conceivable standpoint. What matters to us is this. The
organization has been called syndicalist—even anarchist—and later on the
criminal syndicalism laws enacted in several states were applied to it. The
principle of “direct” action on the spot and the doctrinal concession to the
Western Federation of Miners which assigned to industrial unions a basic
one can recognize this and even judge it according to one’s moral or humanitarian standard,
and at the same time also recognize that partly owing to the undeveloped state of public
administration, partly owing to the presence of elements with which no gentler method would
have worked, and partly owing to the nation’s determination to press forward on the road of
economic development, problems did present themselves under a different aspect and would
have done so even to a governmental agency completely free from bourgeois blinkers.


role in the construction of socialist society—De Leon’s contribution to or
deviation from classical Marxism—no doubt suggest that it was. But it seems
more correct to speak of the insertion of syndicalist elements into what
substantially was and remained an offshoot, of the Marxian stem than to base
diagnosis entirely on those elements.

Thus that great sociologist, the man in the street, has been right once
more. He said that socialism and socialists were un-American. If I catch
his meaning, it amounts pretty much to what, less succinctly, I have
been trying to convey. American development practically skipped the
phase of socialism which saw the career of unadulterated Marxism and
of the Second International. Their essential problems were hardly
understood. The attitudes appropriate to them existed only as sporadic
imports. American problems and attitudes occasionally borrowed these
imported articles. But that was all. And the events of the next phase
impinged on intellectuals and on a proletariat that had not gone through
the Marxian school.
