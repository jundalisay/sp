5. So would that family likeness between commercial and socialist
economy which the reader cannot have failed to notice all along. Since this
resemblance seems to have given pleasure to non-socialists and some
socialists and to have annoyed other socialists, it is just as well to restate
explicitly in what it consists and to what it is due. 

It will then be seen how
little reason there is for either the pleasure or the annoyance. In trying to
construct a rational schema of a socialist economy we have made use of
mechanisms and concepts traditionally specified by terms that are familiar
to us from our discussions of the processes and problems of capitalist
economy. We have described a mechanism which is immediately understood
as soon as we utter the words “market,” “buying and selling,” “competing”
and so on. 

We seem to have used, or barely avoided using, such terms
savoring of capitalism as prices, costs, incomes and even profits while rent,
interest, wages and others, money among them, have, as it were, hovered
about our path.

Let us consider what to most socialists would certainly seem to be one
of the worst cases, that of rent, meaning thereby returns from the productive
use of natural agents, let us say “land.” Our schema evidently cannot imply
that ground rent would be paid to any landholders. What then does it imply?
Simply that any kind of land which is not plentiful beyond all requirements
in the calculable future must be used economically or allocated rationally
exactly like labor or any other type of productive resources, and that for this
purpose it must receive an index of economic significance with which any
new use that may suggest itself must be compared and by means of which
the land enters the social bookkeeping process. If this were not done the
commonwealth would be behaving irrationally. But no concession to
capitalism or to the spirit of capitalism is implied in doing it. All that is
commercial or capitalist about ground rent, in both its economic and its
sociological associations, and all that can possibly be sympathetic to the
advocate of private property (private income, the landlord and so on) has
been completely removed.

The “incomes” with which we endowed the comrades at the start are not
wages. In fact they would on analysis be seen to be composites of disparate
economic elements of which one only could be linked to marginal
productivity of labor. The premiums which we introduced later have more
to do with the wages of capitalist society. But the counterpart of the latter
really exists nowhere except in the books of the central board and again
consists in a mere index of significance associated, for the purposes of
rational allocation, with every type and grade of labor—an index from which has vanished a whole bundle of meanings that pertain to the capitalist world.

In passing, we may observe that since we can call as we please the units into
which we split the vouchers that represent the comrade’s claims to
consumers’ goods, we can also call them hours of labor. And since the total
number of these units is—within the limits set by convenience—no less
arbitrary we could make it equal to the hours actually worked, adjusting all
kinds and grades of labor to some standard quality in the Ricardo-Marxian
way. Finally our commonwealth can adopt, just as well as any other, the
principle that “incomes” should be proportional to the hours of standard
work contributed by each comrade. Then we should have a system of labor
notes. And the interesting point about it is that barring technical difficulties
which do not concern us now such a system would prove quite workable.
But it is easy to see why even then these “incomes” would not be “wages.”
It is no less obvious that the workability of such an arrangement does not
prove anything for the labor theory of value.

It is hardly necessary to perform the same operation on profits, interest,
prices and costs. The cause of that family likeness is by now clearly visible
without doing so: our socialism borrows nothing from capitalism, but
capitalism borrows much from the perfectly general logic of choice. Any
rational behavior must of course display certain formal similarities with any
other rational behavior, and it so happens that in the sphere of economic
behavior the molding influence of mere rationality goes pretty far, at least
with regard to the pure theory of it. The concepts which express the
behaviorist pattern are then drenched with all the particular meanings of a
historical epoch and will tend to retain, in the layman’s mind, the colors thus
acquired. If our historical acquaintance with economic phenomena had been
made in socialist environments, we should now seem to be borrowing
socialist concepts when analyzing a capitalist process.

So far, there is nothing for capitalist-minded economists to congratulate
themselves on in the discovery that socialism could after all only use
capitalist mechanisms and categories. There should be as little reason for
socialists to object. For only the most naïve mind can feel disappointed at
the fact that the socialist miracle does not create a logic of its own, and only
the crudest and most stupid variants of the socialist creed can be endangered
by any demonstration to that effect—those variants according to which the
capitalist process is nothing but a wild jumble without any logic or order at
all. 

Reasonable people of both persuasions can agree on such resemblance
as there is and remain just as far apart as ever. But an objection on the score
of terminology might remain: it may be argued that it is not convenient to
use terms loaded with adventitious yet very important meaning which not
everyone can be trusted to discard. Moreover, we must not forget that one may accept the result arrived at about the essential sameness of the economic logic of socialist and commercial production and yet object to the particular
schema or model by means of which we have arrived at it (see below)
This is not all however. Some socialist as well as non-socialist economists
have been not only willing but anxious to recognize a particularly strong
family likeness between a socialist economy of the type envisaged and a
commercial economy of the perfectly competitive type. We might almost
speak of a school of socialist thought that tends to glorify perfect competition
and to advocate socialism on the ground that it offers the only method by
which the results of perfect competition can be attained in the modern world.
