IN my theory of vanishing investment opportunity, a reservation was made in favor of the possibility that the economic wants
of humanity might some day be so completely satisfied that little motive
would be left to push productive effort still further ahead. Such a state of
satiety is no doubt very far off even if we keep within the present scheme
of wants; and if we take account of the fact that, as higher standards of
life are attained, these wants automatically expand and new wants emerge
or are created, 1 satiety becomes a flying goal, particularly if we include
leisure among consumers’ goods. 

However, let us glance at that possibility,
assuming, still more unrealistically, that methods of production have
reached a state of perfection which does not admit of further improvement
A more or less stationary state would ensue. Capitalism, being essentially
an evolutionary process, would become atrophic. 

There would be nothing left
for entrepreneurs to do. They would find themselves in much the same
situation as generals would in a society perfectly sure of permanent peace.
Profits and along with profits the rate of interest would converge toward zero.
The bourgeois strata that live on profits and interest would tend to disappear.
The management of industry and trade would become a matter of current
administration, and the personnel would unavoidably acquire the characteristics
of a bureaucracy. Socialism of a very sober type would almost automatically
come into being. Human energy would turn away from business. Other than
economic pursuits would attract the brains and provide the adventure.
For the calculable future this vision is of no importance. But all the
greater importance attaches to the fact that many of the effects on the
structure of society and on the organization of the productive process that
we might expect from an approximately complete satisfaction of wants or
from absolute technological perfection can also be expected from a
development that is clearly observable already. Progress itself may be
mechanized as well as the management of a stationary economy, and this
mechanization of progress may affect entrepreneurship and capitalist society nearly as much as the cessation of economic progress would. 

In order to see
this it is only necessary to restate, first, what the entrepreneurial function
consists in and, secondly, what it means for bourgeois society and the
survival of the capitalist order.

<!-- 1 Wilhelm Wundt called this the Heterogony of Aims (Heterogonie der Zwecke). -->

We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize
the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an
untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing
an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials
or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on. Railroad
construction in its earlier stages, electrical power production before the First
World War, steam and steel, the motorcar, colonial ventures afford spectacular
instances of a large genus which comprises innumerable humbler ones—down
to such things as making a success of a particular kind of sausage or
toothbrush. This kind of activity is primarily responsible for the recurrent
“prosperities” that revolutionize the economic organism and the recurrent
“recessions” that are due to the disequilibrating impact of the new products
or methods. To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct
economic function, first, because they lie outside of the routine tasks which
everybody understands and, secondly, because the environment resists in many
ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to
finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to
produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and
to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small
fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as
the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either
inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions which the enterprise
exploits. It consists in getting things done.

This social function is already losing importance and is bound to lose it
at an accelerating rate in the future even if the economic process itself of
which entrepreneurship was the prime mover went on unabated. For, on the
one hand, it is much easier now than it has been in the past to do things that
lie outside familiar routine—innovation itself is being reduced to routine.
Technological progress is increasingly becoming the business of teams of
trained specialists who turn out what is required and make it work in
predictable ways. The romance of earlier commercial adventure is rapidly
wearing away, because so many more things can be strictly calculated that
had of old to be visualized in a flash of genius.

On the other hand, personality and will power must count for less in
environments which have become accustomed to economic change—best
instanced by an incessant stream of new consumers’ and producers’ goods—
and which, instead of resisting, accept it as a matter of course. The resistance which comes from interests threatened by an innovation in the productive
process is not likely to die out as long as the capitalist order persists. It is,
for instance, the great obstacle on the road toward mass production of cheap
housing which presupposes radical mechanization and wholesale elimination
of inefficient methods of work on the plot. But every other kind of
resistance—the resistance, in particular, of consumers and producers to a new
kind of thing because it is new—has well-nigh vanished already.
Thus, economic progress tends to become depersonalized and
automatized. Bureau and committee work tends to replace individual action.
Once more, reference to the military analogy will help to bring out the
essential point.

Of old, roughly up to and including the Napoleonic Wars, generalship
meant leadership and success meant the personal success of the man in
command who earned corresponding “profits” in terms of social prestige.
The technique of warfare and the structure of armies being what they were,
the individual decision and driving power of the leading man—even his
actual presence on a showy horse—were essential elements in the strategical
and tactical situations. Napoleon’s presence was, and had to be, actually felt
on his battlefields. This is no longer so. Rationalized and specialized office
work will eventually blot out personality, the calculable result, the “vision.”
The leading man no longer has the opportunity to fling himself into the fray.
He is becoming just another office worker—and one who is not always
difficult to replace.

Or take another military analogy. Warfare in the Middle Ages was a very
personal affair. The armored knights practiced an art that required lifelong
training and every one of them counted individually by virtue of personal
skill and prowess. It is easy to understand why this craft should have become
the basis of a social class in the fullest and richest sense of that term. But
social and technological change undermined and eventually destroyed both
the function and the position of that class. Warfare itself did not cease on
that account. It simply became more and more mechanized—eventually so
much so that success in what now is a mere profession no longer carries that
connotation of individual achievement which would raise not only the man
but also his group into a durable position of social leadership.
Now a similar social process—in the last analysis the same social
process—undermines the role and, along with the role, the social position
of the capitalist entrepreneur. His role, though less glamorous than that of
medieval warlords, great or small, also is or was just another form of
individual leadership acting by virtue of personal force and personal
responsibility for success. His position, like that of warrior classes, is
threatened as soon as this function in the social process loses its importance, and no less if this is due to the cessation of the social needs it served than if those needs are being served by other, more impersonal, methods.

But this affects the position of the entire bourgeois stratum. Although
entrepreneurs are not necessarily or even typically elements of that stratum from
the outset, they nevertheless enter it in case of success. Thus, though
entrepreneurs do not per se form a social class, the bourgeois class absorbs them
and their families and connections, thereby recruiting and revitalizing itself
currently while at the same time the families that sever their active relation to
“business” drop out of it after a generation or two. Between, there is the bulk
of what we refer to as industrialists, merchants, financiers and bankers; they are
in the intermediate stage between entrepreneurial venture and mere current
administration of an inherited domain. The returns on which the class lives are
produced by, and the social position of the class rests on, the success of this more
or less active sector—which of course may, as it does in this country, form over
90 per cent of the bourgeois stratum—and of the individuals who are in the act
of rising into that class. Economically and sociologically, directly and indirectly,
the bourgeoisie therefore depends on the entrepreneur and, as a class, lives and
will die with him, though a more or less prolonged transitional stage—eventually
a stage in which it may feel equally unable to die and to live—is quite likely to
occur, as in fact it did occur in the case of the feudal civilization.

If capitalist evolution—“progress”— either ceases or becomes completely automatic, the economic basis of the
industrial bourgeoisie will be reduced eventually to wages such as are paid
for current administrative work excepting remnants of quasi-rents and
monopoloid gains that may be expected to linger on for some time. Since
capitalist enterprise, by its very achievements, tends to automatize progress,
we conclude that it tends to make itself superfluous—to break to pieces
under the pressure of its own success. 

The perfectly bureaucratized giant industrial unit not only ousts the small or medium-sized firm and
“expropriates” its owners, but in the end it also ousts the entrepreneur and
expropriates the bourgeoisie as a class which in the process stands to lose
not only its income but also what is infinitely more important, its function.
The true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who
preached it but the Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Rockefellers. 

This result may
not in every respect be to the taste of Marxian socialists, still less to the taste
of socialists of a more popular (Marx would have said, vulgar) description.
But so far as prognosis goes, it does not differ from theirs.
