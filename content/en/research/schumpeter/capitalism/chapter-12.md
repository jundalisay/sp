I. THE OBSOLESCENCE O F T HE E NTREPRENEURIAL F UNCTION


IN OUR discussion of the theory of vanishing investment opportunity, a
reservation was made in favor of the possibility that the economic wants
of humanity might some day be so completely satisfied that little motive
would be left to push productive effort still further ahead. Such a state of
satiety is no doubt very far off even if we keep within the present scheme
of wants; and if we take account of the fact that, as higher standards of
life are attained, these wants automatically expand and new wants emerge
or are created, 1 satiety becomes a flying goal, particularly if we include
leisure among consumers’ goods. However, let us glance at that possibility,
assuming, still more unrealistically, that methods of production have
reached a state of perfection which does not admit of further improvement
A more or less stationary state would ensue. Capitalism, being essentially
an evolutionary process, would become atrophic. There would be nothing left
for entrepreneurs to do. They would find themselves in much the same
situation as generals would in a society perfectly sure of permanent peace.
Profits and along with profits the rate of interest would converge toward zero.
The bourgeois strata that live on profits and interest would tend to disappear.
The management of industry and trade would become a matter of current
administration, and the personnel would unavoidably acquire the characteristics
of a bureaucracy. Socialism of a very sober type would almost automatically
come into being. Human energy would turn away from business. Other than
economic pursuits would attract the brains and provide the adventure.
For the calculable future this vision is of no importance. But all the
greater importance attaches to the fact that many of the effects on the
structure of society and on the organization of the productive process that
we might expect from an approximately complete satisfaction of wants or
from absolute technological perfection can also be expected from a
development that is clearly observable already. Progress itself may be
mechanized as well as the management of a stationary economy, and this
mechanization of progress may affect entrepreneurship and capitalist society nearly as much as the cessation of economic progress would. In order to see
this it is only necessary to restate, first, what the entrepreneurial function
consists in and, secondly, what it means for bourgeois society and the
survival of the capitalist order.

<!-- 1 Wilhelm Wundt called this the Heterogony of Aims (Heterogonie der Zwecke). -->

We have seen that the function of entrepreneurs is to reform or revolutionize
the pattern of production by exploiting an invention or, more generally, an
untried technological possibility for producing a new commodity or producing
an old one in a new way, by opening up a new source of supply of materials
or a new outlet for products, by reorganizing an industry and so on. Railroad
construction in its earlier stages, electrical power production before the First
World War, steam and steel, the motorcar, colonial ventures afford spectacular
instances of a large genus which comprises innumerable humbler ones—down
to such things as making a success of a particular kind of sausage or
toothbrush. This kind of activity is primarily responsible for the recurrent
“prosperities” that revolutionize the economic organism and the recurrent
“recessions” that are due to the disequilibrating impact of the new products
or methods. To undertake such new things is difficult and constitutes a distinct
economic function, first, because they lie outside of the routine tasks which
everybody understands and, secondly, because the environment resists in many
ways that vary, according to social conditions, from simple refusal either to
finance or to buy a new thing, to physical attack on the man who tries to
produce it. To act with confidence beyond the range of familiar beacons and
to overcome that resistance requires aptitudes that are present in only a small
fraction of the population and that define the entrepreneurial type as well as
the entrepreneurial function. This function does not essentially consist in either
inventing anything or otherwise creating the conditions which the enterprise
exploits. It consists in getting things done.
This social function is already losing importance and is bound to lose it
at an accelerating rate in the future even if the economic process itself of
which entrepreneurship was the prime mover went on unabated. For, on the
one hand, it is much easier now than it has been in the past to do things that
lie outside familiar routine—innovation itself is being reduced to routine.
Technological progress is increasingly becoming the business of teams of
trained specialists who turn out what is required and make it work in
predictable ways. The romance of earlier commercial adventure is rapidly
wearing away, because so many more things can be strictly calculated that
had of old to be visualized in a flash of genius.
On the other hand, personality and will power must count for less in
environments which have become accustomed to economic change—best
instanced by an incessant stream of new consumers’ and producers’ goods—
and which, instead of resisting, accept it as a matter of course. The resistance
Crumbling Walls 133
which comes from interests threatened by an innovation in the productive
process is not likely to die out as long as the capitalist order persists. It is,
for instance, the great obstacle on the road toward mass production of cheap
housing which presupposes radical mechanization and wholesale elimination
of inefficient methods of work on the plot. But every other kind of
resistance—the resistance, in particular, of consumers and producers to a new
kind of thing because it is new—has well-nigh vanished already.
Thus, economic progress tends to become depersonalized and
automatized. Bureau and committee work tends to replace individual action.
Once more, reference to the military analogy will help to bring out the
essential point.
Of old, roughly up to and including the Napoleonic Wars, generalship
meant leadership and success meant the personal success of the man in
command who earned corresponding “profits” in terms of social prestige.
The technique of warfare and the structure of armies being what they were,
the individual decision and driving power of the leading man—even his
actual presence on a showy horse—were essential elements in the strategical
and tactical situations. Napoleon’s presence was, and had to be, actually felt
on his battlefields. This is no longer so. Rationalized and specialized office
work will eventually blot out personality, the calculable result, the “vision.”
The leading man no longer has the opportunity to fling himself into the fray.
He is becoming just another office worker—and one who is not always
difficult to replace.
Or take another military analogy. Warfare in the Middle Ages was a very
personal affair. The armored knights practiced an art that required lifelong
training and every one of them counted individually by virtue of personal
skill and prowess. It is easy to understand why this craft should have become
the basis of a social class in the fullest and richest sense of that term. But
social and technological change undermined and eventually destroyed both
the function and the position of that class. Warfare itself did not cease on
that account. It simply became more and more mechanized—eventually so
much so that success in what now is a mere profession no longer carries that
connotation of individual achievement which would raise not only the man
but also his group into a durable position of social leadership.
Now a similar social process—in the last analysis the same social
process—undermines the role and, along with the role, the social position
of the capitalist entrepreneur. His role, though less glamorous than that of
medieval warlords, great or small, also is or was just another form of
individual leadership acting by virtue of personal force and personal
responsibility for success. His position, like that of warrior classes, is
threatened as soon as this function in the social process loses its importance,
Can Capitalism Survive?134
and no less if this is due to the cessation of the social needs it served than
if those needs are being served by other, more impersonal, methods.
But this affects the position of the entire bourgeois stratum. Although
entrepreneurs are not necessarily or even typically elements of that stratum from
the outset, they nevertheless enter it in case of success. Thus, though
entrepreneurs do not per se form a social class, the bourgeois class absorbs them
and their families and connections, thereby recruiting and revitalizing itself
currently while at the same time the families that sever their active relation to
“business” drop out of it after a generation or two. Between, there is the bulk
of what we refer to as industrialists, merchants, financiers and bankers; they are
in the intermediate stage between entrepreneurial venture and mere current
administration of an inherited domain. The returns on which the class lives are
produced by, and the social position of the class rests on, the success of this more
or less active sector—which of course may, as it does in this country, form over
90 per cent of the bourgeois stratum—and of the individuals who are in the act
of rising into that class. Economically and sociologically, directly and indirectly,
the bourgeoisie therefore depends on the entrepreneur and, as a class, lives and
will die with him, though a more or less prolonged transitional stage—eventually
a stage in which it may feel equally unable to die and to live—is quite likely to
occur, as in fact it did occur in the case of the feudal civilization.
To sum up this part of our argument: if capitalist evolution—“progress”—
either ceases or becomes completely automatic, the economic basis of the
industrial bourgeoisie will be reduced eventually to wages such as are paid
for current administrative work excepting remnants of quasi-rents and
monopoloid gains that may be expected to linger on for some time. Since
capitalist enterprise, by its very achievements, tends to automatize progress,
we conclude that it tends to make itself superfluous—to break to pieces
under the pressure of its own success. The perfectly bureaucratized giant
industrial unit not only ousts the small or medium-sized firm and
“expropriates” its owners, but in the end it also ousts the entrepreneur and
expropriates the bourgeoisie as a class which in the process stands to lose
not only its income but also what is infinitely more important, its function.
The true pacemakers of socialism were not the intellectuals or agitators who
preached it but the Vanderbilts, Carnegies and Rockefellers. This result may
not in every respect be to the taste of Marxian socialists, still less to the taste
of socialists of a more popular (Marx would have said, vulgar) description.
But so far as prognosis goes, it does not differ from theirs.
II. T HE D ESTRUCTION O F T HE P ROTECTING S TRATA
So far we have been considering the effects of the capitalist process upon
the economic bases of the upper strata of capitalist society and upon their
Crumbling Walls 135
social position and prestige. But effects further extend to the institutional
framework that protected them. In showing this we shall take the term in its
widest acceptance so as to include not only legal institutions but also
attitudes of the public mind and policies.
1. Capitalist evolution first of all destroyed, or went far toward destroying,
the institutional arrangements of the feudal world—the manor, the village, the
craft guild. The facts and mechanisms of this process are too familiar to detain
us. Destruction was wrought in three ways. The world of the artisan was
destroyed primarily by the automatic effects of the competition that came from
the capitalist entrepreneur; political action in removing atrophic organizations
and regulations only registered results. The world of the lord and the peasant
was destroyed primarily by political—in some cases revolutionary—action and
capitalism merely presided over adaptive transformations say, of the German
manorial organizations into large-scale agricul tural units of production. But
along with these industrial and agrarian revolutions went a no less
revolutionary change in the general attitude of legislative authority and public
opinion. Together with the old economic organization vanished the economic
and political privileges of the classes or groups that used to play the leading
role in it, particularly the tax exemptions and the political prerogatives of the
landed nobility and gentry and of the clergy.
Economically all this meant for the bourgeoisie the breaking of so many
fetters and the removal of so many barriers. Politically it meant the
replacement of an order in which the bourgeois was a humble subject by
another that was more congenial to his rationalist mind and to his immediate
interests. But, surveying that process from the standpoint of today, the
observer might well wonder whether in the end such complete emancipation
was good for the bourgeois and his world. For those fetters not only
hampered, they also sheltered. Before proceeding further we must carefully
clarify and appraise this point.
2. The related processes of the rise of the capitalist bourgeoisie and of
the rise of national states produced, in the sixteenth, seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, a social structure that may seem to us amphibial though
it was no more amphibial or transitional than any other. Consider the
outstanding instance that is afforded by the monarchy of Louis XIV. The
royal power had subjugated the landed aristocracy and at the same time
conciliated it by proffering employment and pensions and by conditionally
accepting its claim to a ruling or leading class position. The same royal
power had subjugated and allied itself with the clergy. 2 It had finally
strengthened its sway over the bourgeoisie, its old ally in the struggle with
2 Gallicanism was nothing else but the ideological reflex of this.
Can Capitalism Survive?136
the territorial magnates, protecting and propelling its enterprise in order to
exploit it the more effectively in turn. Peasants and the (small) industrial
proletariat were likewise managed, exploited and protected by public
authority—though the protection was in the case of the French ancien régime
very much less in evidence than for instance in the Austria of Maria Theresa
or of Joseph II—and, vicariously, by landlords or industrialists. This was not
simply a government in the sense of nineteenth-century liberalism, i.e., a
social agency existing for the performance of a few limited functions to be
financed by a minimum of revenue. On principle, the monarchy managed
everything, from consciences to the patterns of the silk fabrics of Lyons, and
financially it aimed at a maximum of revenue. Though the king was never
really absolute, public authority was all-comprehensive.
Correct diagnosis of this pattern is of the utmost importance for our subject.
The king, the court, the army, the church and the bureaucracy lived to an
increasing extent on revenue created by the capitalist process, even purely
feudal sources of income being swelled in consequence of contemporaneous
capitalist developments. To an increasing extent also, domestic and foreign
policies and institutional changes were shaped to suit and propel that
development. As far as that goes, the feudal elements in the structure of the
so-called absolute monarchy come in only under the heading of atavisms
which in fact is the diagnosis one would naturally adopt at first sight.
Looking more closely, however, we realize that those elements meant
more than that. The steel frame of that structure still consisted of the human
material of feudal society and this material still behaved according to
precapitalist patterns. It filled the offices of state, officered the army, devised
policies—it functioned as a classe dirigente and, though taking account of
bourgeois interests, it took care to distance itself from the bourgeoisie. The
centerpiece, the king, was king by the grace of God, and the root of his
position was feudal, not only in the historical but also in the sociological
sense, however much he availed himself of the economic possibilities offered
by capitalism. All this was more than atavism. It was an active symbiosis of
two social strata, one of which no doubt supported the other economically
but was in turn supported by the other politically. Whatever we may think
of the achievements or shortcomings of this arrangement, whatever the
bourgeois himself may have thought of it at the time or later—and of the
aristocratic scapegrace or idler—it was of the essence of that society.
3. Of that society only? The subsequent course of things, best exemplified
by the English case, suggests the answer. The aristocratic element continued
to rule the roost right to the end of the period of intact and vital capitalism.
No doubt that element—though nowhere so effectively as in England—
currently absorbed the brains from other strata that drifted into politics; it
Crumbling Walls 137
made itself the representative of bourgeois interests and fought the battles
of the bourgeoisie; it had to surrender its last legal privileges; but with these
qualifications, and for ends no longer its own, it continued to man the
political engine, to manage the state, to govern.
The economically operative part of the bourgeois strata did not offer much
opposition to this. On the whole, that kind of division of labor suited them
and they liked it. Where they did revolt against it or where they got into the
political saddle without having to revolt, they did not make a conspicuous
success of ruling and did not prove able to hold their own. The question
arises whether it is really safe to assume that these failures were merely due
to lack of opportunity to acquire experience and, with experience, the
attitudes of a politically ruling class.
It is not. There is a more fundamental reason for those failures such as
are instanced by the French or German experiences with bourgeois attempts
at ruling—a reason which again will best be visualized by contrasting the
figure of the industrialist or merchant with that of the medieval lord. The
latter’s “profession” not only qualified him admirably for the defense of his
own class interest—he was not only able to fight for it physically—but it also
cast a halo around him and made of him a ruler of men. The first was
important, but more so were the mystic glamour and the lordly attitude—
that ability and habit to command and to be obeyed that carried prestige with
all classes of society and in every walk of life. That prestige was so great
and that attitude so useful that the class position outlived the social and
technological conditions which had given rise to it and proved adaptable, by
means of a transformation of the class function, to quite different social and
economic conditions. With the utmost ease and grace the lords and knights
metamorphosed themselves into courtiers, administrators, diplomats,
politicians and into military officers of a type that had nothing whatever to
do with that of the medieval knight. And—most astonishing phenomenon
when we come to think of it—a remnant of that old prestige survives even
to this day, and not only with our ladies.
Of the industrialist and merchant the opposite is true. There is surely no trace
of any mystic glamour about him which is what counts in the ruling of men.
The stock exchange is a poor substitute for the Holy Grail. We have seen that
the industrialist and merchant, as far as they are entrepreneurs, also fill a function
of leadership. But economic leadership of this type does not readily expand, like
the medieval lord’s military leadership, into the leadership of nations. On the
contrary, the ledger and the cost calculation absorb and confine.
I have called the bourgeois rationalist and unheroic. He can only use
rationalist and unheroic means to defend his position or to bend a nation to
his will. He can impress by what people may expect from his economic
Can Capitalism Survive?138
performance, he can argue his case, he can promise to pay out money or
threaten to withhold it, he can hire the treacherous services of a condottiere
or politician or journalist. But that is all and all of it is greatly overrated as
to its political value. Nor are his experiences and habits of life of the kind
that develop personal fascination. A genius in the business office may be,
and often is, utterly unable outside of it to say boo to a goose—both in the
drawing room and on the platform. Knowing this he wants to be left alone
and to leave politics alone.
Again exceptions will occur to the reader. But again they do not amount
to much. Aptitude for, and interest and success in, city management is the
only important exception in Europe, and this will be found to strengthen our
case instead of weakening it. Before the advent of the modern metropolis,
which is no longer a bourgeois affair, city management was akin to business
management. Grasp of its problems and authority within its precincts came
naturally to the manufacturer and trader, and the local interests of
manufacturing and trading supplied most of the subject matter of its politics
which therefore lent itself to treatment by the methods and in the spirit of
the business office. Under exceptionally favorable conditions, exceptional
developments sprouted from those roots, such as the developments of the
Venetian or Genoese republics. The case of the Low Countries enters into
the same pattern, but it is particularly instructive by virtue of the fact that
the merchants’ republic invariably failed in the great game of international
politics and that in practically every emergency it had to hand over the reins
to a warlord of feudal complexion. As regards the United States, it would
be easy to list the uniquely favorable circumstances—rapidly waning—that
explain its case. 3
4. The inference is obvious: barring such exceptional conditions, the
bourgeois class is ill equipped to face the problems, both domestic and
international, that have normally to be faced by a country of any importance.
The bourgeois themselves feel this in spite of all the phraseology that seems
to deny it, and so do the masses. Within a protecting framework not made
of bourgeois material, the bourgeoisie may be successful, not only in the
political defensive but also in the offensive, especially as an opposition. For
a time it felt so safe as to be able to afford the luxury of attacking the
protective frame itself; such bourgeois opposition as there was in imperial
Germany illustrates this to perfection. But without protection by some non-
bourgeois group, the bourgeoisie is politically helpless and unable not only
to lead its nation but even to take care of its particular class interest. Which
amounts to saying that it needs a master.
3 This line of reasoning will he taken up again in Part IV.
Crumbling Walls 139
But the capitalist process, both by its economic mechanics and by its
psycho-sociological effects, did away with this protecting master or, as in
this country, never gave him, or a substitute for him, a chance to develop.
The implications of this are strengthened by another consequence of the
same process. Capitalist evolution eliminates not only the king Dei Gratia
but also the political entrenchments that, had they proved tenable, would
have been formed by the village and the craft guild. Of course, neither
organization was tenable in the precise shape in which capitalism found it.
But capitalist policies wrought destruction much beyond what was
unavoidable. They attacked the artisan in reservations in which he could have
survived for an indefinite time. They forced upon the peasant all the
blessings of early liberalism—the free and unsheltered holding and all the
individualist rope he needed in order to hang himself.
In breaking down the pre-capitalist framework of society, capitalism
thus broke not only barriers that impeded its progress but also flying
buttresses that prevented its collapse. That process, impressive in its
relentless necessity, was not merely a matter of removing institutional
deadwood, but of removing partners of the capitalist stratum, symbiosis
with whom was an essential element of the capitalist schema. Having
discovered this fact which so many slogans obscure, we might well wonder
whether it is quite correct to look upon capitalism as a social form sui
generis or, in fact, as anything else but the last stage of the decomposition
of what we have called feudalism. On the whole, I am inclined to believe
that its peculiarities suffice to make a type and to accept that symbiosis of
classes which owe their existence to different epochs and processes as the
rule rather than as an exception—at least it has been the rule these 6000
years, i.e., ever since primitive tillers of the soil became the subjects of
mounted nomads. But there is no great objection that I can see against the
opposite view alluded to.
III. T HE D ESTRUCTION O F T HE I NSTITUTIONAL F RAMEWORK
O F C APITALIST S OCIETY
We return from our digression with a load of ominous facts. They are almost,
though not quite, sufficient to establish our next point, viz., that the capitalist
process in much the same way in which it destroyed the institutional
framework of feudal society also undermines its own.
It has been pointed out above that the very success of capitalist enterprise
paradoxically tends to impair the prestige or social weight of the class
primarily associated with it and that the giant unit of control tends to oust
the bourgeoisie from the function to which it owed that social weight. The
corresponding change in the meaning, and the incidental loss in vitality, of
Can Capitalism Survive?140
the institutions of the bourgeois world and of its typical attitudes are easy
to trace.
On the one hand, the capitalist process unavoidably attacks the economic
standing ground of the small producer and trader. What it did to the pre-
capitalist strata it also does—and by the same competitive mechanism—to
the lower strata of capitalist industry. Here of course Marx scores. It is true
that the facts of industrial concentration do not quite live up to the ideas the
public is being taught to entertain about it (see Chapter XIX). The process
has gone less far and is less free from setbacks and compensatory tendencies
than one would gather from many a popular exposition. In particular,
largescale enterprise not only annihilates but also, to some extent, creates
space for the small producing, and especially trading, firm. Also, in the case
of the peasants and farmers, the capitalist world has at last proved both
willing and able to pursue an expensive but on the whole effective policy of
conservation. In the long run, however, there can. be little doubt about the
fact we are envisaging, or about its consequences. Outside of the agrarian
field, moreover, the bourgeoisie has shown but little awareness of the
problem4 or its importance for the survival of the capitalist order. The profits
to be made by rationalizing the organization of production and especially by
cheapening the tortuous way of commodities from the factory to the ultimate
consumer are more than the mind of the typical businessman can resist.
Now it is important to realize precisely what these consequences consist
in. A very common type of social criticism which we have already met
laments the “decline of competition” and equates it to the decline of
capitalism because of the virtues it attributes to competition and the vices it
attributes to modern industrial “monopolies.” In this schema of
interpretation, monopolization plays the role of arteriosclerosis and reacts
upon the fortunes of the capitalist order through increasingly unsatisfactory
economic performance. We have seen the reasons for rejecting this view.
Economically neither the case for competition nor the case against
concentration of economic control is anything like as strong as this argument
implies. And, whether weak or strong, it misses the salient point. Even if the
giant concerns were all managed so perfectly as to call forth applause from
the angels in heaven, the political consequences of concentration would still
be what they are. The political structure of a nation is profoundly affected
by the elimination of a host of small and mediumsized firms the owner-
managers of which, together with their dependents, henchmen and
connections, count quantitatively at the polls and have a hold on what we
4 Although some governments did; the government of imperial Germany did much to fight
this particular kind of rationalization, and there is now a strong tendency to do the same in
this country.
Crumbling Walls 141
may term the foreman class that no management of a large unit can ever
have; the very foundation of private property and free contracting wears
away in a nation in which its most vital, most concrete, most meaningful
types disappear from the moral horizon of the people.
On the other hand, the capitalist process also attacks its own institutional
framework—let us continue to visualize “property” and “free contracting” as
partes pro toto—within the precincts of the big units. Excepting the cases that
are still of considerable importance in which a corporation is practically owned
by a single individual or family, the figure of the proprietor and with it the
specifically proprietary interest have vanished from the picture. There are the
salaried executives and all the salaried managers and submanagers. There are
the big stockholders. And then there are the small stockholders. The first group
tends to acquire the employee attitude and rarely if ever identifies itself with
the stockholding interest even in the most favorable cases, i.e., in the cases in
which it identifies itself with the interest of the concern as such. The second
group, even if it considers its connection with the concern as permanent and
even if it actually behaves as financial theory would have stockholders behave,
is at one remove from both the functions and the attitudes of an owner. As to
the third group, small stockholders often do not care much about what for most
of them is but a minor source of income and, whether they care or not, they
hardly ever bother, unless they or some representatives of theirs are out to
exploit their nuisance value; being often very ill used and still more often
thinking themselves ill used, they almost regularly drift into an attitude hostile
to “their” corporations, to big business in general and, particularly when things
look bad, to the capitalist order as such. No element of any of those three
groups into which I schematized the typical situation unconditionally takes the
attitude characteristic of that curious phenomenon, so full of meaning and so
rapidly passing, that is covered by the term Property.

Freedom of contracting is in the same boat. In its full vitality it meant
individual contracting regulated by individual choice between an indefinite
number of possibilities. The stereotyped, unindividual, impersonal and
bureaucratized contract of today—this applies much more generally, but a
potiori we may fasten upon the labor contract—which presents but restricted
freedom of choice and mostly turns on a c’est à prendre ou à laisser, has none
of the old features the most important of which become impossible with giant
concerns dealing with other giant concerns or impersonal masses of workmen
or consumers. The void is being filled by a tropical growth of new legal
structures—and a little reflection shows that this could hardly be otherwise.

Thus the capitalist process pushes into the background all those
institutions, the institutions of property and free contracting in particular, that
expressed the needs and ways of the truly “private” economic activity. Where it does not abolish them, as it already has abolished free contracting in the
labor market, it attains the same end by shifting the relative importance of
existing legal forms—the legal forms pertaining to corporate business for
instance as against those pertaining to the partnership or individual firm—
or by changing their contents or meanings. The capitalist process, by
substituting a mere parcel of shares for the walls of and the machines in a
factory, takes the life out of the idea of property. It loosens the grip that once
was so strong—the grip in the sense of the legal right and the actual ability
to do as one pleases with one’s own; the grip also in the sense that the holder
of the title loses the will to fight, economically, physically, politically, for
“his” factory and his control over it, to die if necessary on its steps. And this
evaporation of what we may term the material substance of property—its
visible and touchable reality—affects not only the attitude of holders but also
that of the workmen and of the public in general. Dematerialized,
defunctionalized and absentee ownership does not impress and call forth
moral allegiance as the vital form of property did. Eventually there will be
nobody left who really cares to stand for it—nobody within and nobody
without the precincts of the big concerns.
