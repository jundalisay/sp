3. In a sense, therefore, the Aretino’s pen was indeed stronger than the
sword. But, perhaps through ignorance, I do not know of comparable
instances of that type for the next hundred and fifty years, 6 during which
intellectuals do not seem to have played any great role outside and
independently of the established professions, mainly the law and the church.

This setback roughly coincides with the setback in capitalist evolution
which in most countries of continental Europe occurred in that troubled
period. And the subsequent recovery of capitalist enterprise was similarly
shared by the intellectuals. The cheaper book, the cheap newspaper or
pamphlet, together with the widening of the public that was in part their

product but partly an independent phenomenon due to the access of wealth
and weight which came to the industrial bourgeoisie and to the incident
increase in the political importance of an anonymous public opinion—all
these boons, as well as increasing freedom from restraint, are by-products
of the capitalist engine.

In the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century the individual
patron was slow to lose the paramount importance in the intellectual’s
career that he had held at the beginning. But in the peak successes at
least, we clearly discern the growing importance of the new element—
the support of the collective patron, the bourgeois public. In this as in
every other respect, Voltaire affords an invaluable instance. His very
superficiality that made it possible for him to cover everything from
religion to Newtonian optics, allied to indomitable vitality and an
insatiable curiosity, a perfect absence of inhibitions, an unerring instinct
for and a wholesale acceptance of the humors of his time, enabled that
uncritical critic and mediocre poet and historian to fascinate—and to sell.
He also speculated, cheated, accepted gifts and appointments, but there
was always the independence founded on the solid base of his success
with the public. Rousseau’s case and type, though entirely different,
would be still more instructive to discuss.

In the last decades of the eighteenth century a striking episode displayed
the nature of the power of a free-lance intellectual who has nothing to work
with but the socio-psychological mechanism called Public Opinion. This
happened in England, the country that was then farthest advanced on the
road of capitalist evolution. John Wilkes’ attacks on the political system of
England, it is true, were launched under uniquely favorable circumstances;
moreover, it cannot be said that he actually upset the Earl of Bute’s
government which never had any chance and was bound to fall for a dozen
other reasons; but Wilkes’ North Briton was nevertheless the last straw that
broke…Lord Bute’s political back. No. 45 of the North Briton was the first
discharge in a campaign that secured the abolition of general warrants and
made a great stride toward the freedom of the press and of elections. This
does not amount to making history or to creating the conditions for a change
in social institutions, but it does amount to playing, say, the role of a
midwife’s assistant. 7 The inability of Wilkes’ enemies to thwart him is the
most significant fact about it all. They evidently had all the power of
organized government at their command. Yet something drove them back.
In France, the years preceding the revolution and the revolution itself
brought the rabble-raising tabloid (Marat, Desmoulins), which however did
not, like ours, completely jettison style and grammar. But we must hurry on.
The Terror and, more systematically, the First Empire put an end to this. Then
followed a period, interrupted by the rule of the roi bourgeois, of more or less
resolute repression that lasted until the Second Empire felt compelled to loosen
the reins—about the middle sixties. In central and southern Europe this period
also lasted about as long, and in England analogous conditions prevailed from the beginning of the revolutionary wars to Canning’s accession to power.


<!-- 7 I do not fear that any historian of politics will find that I have exaggerated the importance
of Wilkes’ success. But I do fear objection to my calling him a free lance and to the implication
that he owed everything to the collective, and nothing to any individual patron. In his beginnings
he was no doubt encouraged by a coterie. On examination it will however be conceded, I think,
that this was not of decisive importance and that all the support and all the money and honors
he got afterwards were but a consequence of and tribute to previous success and to a position
independently acquired with the public. -->


4. How impossible it is to stem the tide within the framework of
capitalist society is shown by the failure of the attempts—some of them
prolonged and determined—made during that period by practically all
European governments to bring the intellectuals to heel Their histories
were nothing but so many different versions of Wilkes exploits. In
capitalist society—or in a society that contains a capitalist element of
decisive importance—any attack on the intellectuals must run up against
the private fortresses of bourgeois business which, or some of which, will
shelter the quarry. Moreover such an attack must proceed according to
bourgeois principles of legislative and administrative practice which no
doubt may be stretched and bent but will checkmate prosecution beyond
a certain point. Lawless violence the bourgeois stratum may accept or
even applaud when thoroughly roused or frightened, but only temporarily.
In a purely bourgeois regime like that of Louis Philippe, troops may fire
on strikers, but the police cannot round up intellectuals or must release
them forthwith; otherwise the bourgeois stratum, however strongly
disapproving some of their. doings, will rally behind them because the
freedom it disapproves cannot be crushed without also crushing the
freedom it approves.

Observe that I am not crediting the bourgeoisie with an unrealistic dose
of generosity or idealism. Nor am I unduly stressing what people think and
feel and want—on the importance of which I almost, though not quite, agree
with Marx. In defending the intellectuals as a group—not of course every
individual—the bourgeoisie defends itself and its scheme of life. Only a
government of non-bourgeois nature and non-bourgeois creed—under
modern circumstances only a socialist or fascist one—is strong enough to
discipline them. In order to do that it would have to change typically
bourgeois institutions and drastically reduce the individual freedom of all
strata of the nation. And such a government is not likely—it would not even
be able—to stop short of private enterprise.
Growing Hostility 151
From this follows both the unwillingness and the inability of the
capitalist order to control its intellectual sector effectively. The
unwillingness in question is unwillingness to use methods consistently
that are uncongenial to the mentality shaped by the capitalist process; the
inability is the inability to do so within the frame of institutions shaped
by the capitalist process and without submitting to non-bourgeois rule.
Thus, on the one hand, freedom of public discussion involving freedom
to nibble at the foundations of capitalist society is inevitable in the long
run. On the other hand, the intellectual group cannot help nibbling,
because it lives on criticism and its whole position depends on criticism
that stings; and criticism of persons and of current events will, in a
situation in which nothing is sacrosanct, fatally issue in criticism of
classes and institutions.
