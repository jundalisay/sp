Thus our criterion of superiority or inferiority after all covers more ground
than it seems to. But if we stand by it, what is that strong case for the
superiority of the socialist blueprint of which I spoke before?
The reader who has perused the analysis in Chapter VIII may well wonder.

Most of the arguments usually advanced in support of the socialist and against
the capitalist regi2me, as we have seen, fail as soon as proper account is taken
of the conditions created for business by a rapid rate of progress. Some of
those arguments, on closer inspection, even turn out to cut the other way. Much
of what is being considered pathological is seen to be physiological—to fulfill
important functions in the process of creative destruction. Many wastes carry compensations that sometimes completely, in other cases partly, invalidate the
inference. Socially irrational allocation of resources is not nearly as frequent
or important as it is made out to be. In some cases, moreover, it is no less likely
to occur in a socialist economy. Excess capacity, also partly inevitable in a
socialist economy, will often bear an interpretation which rebuts criticism. And
even unrelieved blemishes are after all but incidents of an achievement that is
great enough to cover a multitude of sins.


9 It should however be noted that an income consisting exclusively of returns on investments
is no indication of the economic idleness of its receiver, because his work may be embodied
in his investments. The classroom illustration of this will serve as well as a longer argument
could: suppose a man reclaims a piece of land by the work of his hands; the return he will
thereafter receive is a “return on an appliance made by man” or, as economists call it, a quasi-rent. 

If the improvement is permanent, it will become undistinguishable from the rent of land
proper and hence look like the very incarnation of unearned income whereas in reality it is a
form of wages if we define wages as returns attributable to personal productive exertions.
Generalizing, we may say that effort may be undergone in order to secure revenues which may,
but need not, take the form of wages.

The answer so our question follows from the last paragraph of the preceding
chapter. It might be of doubtful validity as long as capitalist evolution is in
full swing but it will be decisive as soon as it permanently slackens down,
whether from reasons inherent in or external to its economic mechanism.
There are cases in which capitalist industries are so circumstanced that
prices and output become theoretically indeterminate. They may occur,
though they do not always occur, whenever there is oligopoly. In a socialist
economy everything—limiting cases without practical importance alone
excepted—is uniquely determined. But even when there exists a theoretically
determined state it is much more difficult and expensive to reach in the
capitalist economy than it would be in the socialist economy. In the former
endless moves and counter moves are necessary and decisions have to be
taken in an atmosphere of uncertainty that blunts the edge of action, whereas
that strategy and that uncertainty would be absent from the latter. That this
applies not only to “monopolistic” capitalism but, though for other reasons,
still more to the competitive species is shown by the hogcycle case 10 and by
the behavior of more or less perfectly competitive industries in general
depressions or in vicissitudes of their own.

But this means more than it seems to mean at first sight. Those
determinate solutions of the problems of production are rational or optimal
from the standpoint of given data, and anything that shortens, smoothens or
safeguards the road that leads to them is bound to save human energy and
material resources, and to reduce the costs at which a given result is attained.
Unless the resources thus saved are completely wasted, efficiency in our
sense must necessarily increase.

Under this heading some of the sweeping indictments of the capitalist
system which have been glanced at above acquire a qualified justification.
As an instance, take excess capacity. It is not true that it would be entirely
absent in socialism; it would be absurd for the central board to insist on full
utilization of a new railroad through as yet unsettled country. Nor is it true
that excess capacity spells loss in all cases. But there are types of excess
capacity which do spell loss and can be avoided by a socialist management, the chief case being that of reserve capacity for the purpose of economic warfare.

Whatever the importance of the particular case—I do not think it
is very considerable—it shows up a point to which I have already adverted:
there are things which within the conditions of capitalist evolution are, or
may be, perfectly rational and even necessary and therefore need not, ex visu
of the capitalist order, constitute blemishes at all; nor need they constitute
weaknesses of “monopolistic” as against competitive capitalism if they are
associated, as conditions, with achievements of the former that are out of the
reach of the latter; but even if that be so they may yet constitute weaknesses
as against the socialist blueprint.

This is particularly true of most of the phenomena that make up the
mechanism of trade cycles. Capitalist enterprise does not lack regulators,
some of which may well be met with again in the practice of the ministry
of production. But the planning of progress, in particular the systematic
coordination and orderly distribution in time of new ventures in all lines,
would be incomparably more effective in preventing bursts at some times and
depressive reactions at others than any automatic or manipulative variations
of the rate of interest or the supply of credit can be. 

In fact, it would
eliminate the cause of the cyclical ups and downs whereas in the capitalist
order it is only possible to mitigate them. And the process of discarding the
obsolete that in capitalism—especially in competitive capitalism—means
temporary paralysis and losses that are in part functionless, could be reduced
to what “discarding the obsolete” actually conveys to the layman’s mind
within a comprehensive plan providing in advance for the shifting to other
uses of the non-obsolete complements of the obsolete plants or pieces of
equipment. Concretely: a crisis centering in the cotton industry may in the
capitalist order put a stop to residential construction; in the socialist order it
may of course also happen that the production of cotton goods has to be
drastically curtailed at short notice, though it is not so likely to happen; but
this would be a reason to speed up residential construction instead of
stopping it.

Whatever the economic goals desired by whoever is in the position to
give effect to his desires, socialist management could attain them with less
disturbance and loss without necessarily incurring the disadvantages that
would attend attempts at planning progress within the framework of
capitalist institutions. One aspect of this might be expressed by saying that
the socialist management could steer a course approximating the long-run
trend of output, thus developing a tendency which as we have seen is not
foreign to big-business policy. And the whole of our argument might be
put in a nutshell by saying that socialization means a stride beyond big
business on the way that has been chalked out by it or, what amounts to the same thing, that socialist management may conceivably prove as
superior to big-business capitalism as big-business capitalism has proved
to be to the kind of competitive capitalism of which the English industry
of a hundred years ago was the prototype. It is quite possible that future
generations will look upon arguments about the inferiority of the socialist
plan as we look upon Adam Smith’s arguments about joint-stock
companies which, also, were not simply false.

<!-- Of course, all that I have said so far refers exclusively to the logic of
blueprints, hence to “objective” possibilities which socialism in practice may
be quite unable to realize. But  -->
