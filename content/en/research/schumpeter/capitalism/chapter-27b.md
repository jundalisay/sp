II. THE EFFECTS of the First WORLD War on THE CHANCES Of THE SOCIALIST PARTIES OF EUROPE

1. Any major war that ends in defeat will shake the social fabric and
threaten the position of the ruling group; the loss of prestige resulting from
military defeat is one of the hardest things for a regime to survive. I do
not know of any exception to this rule. But the converse proposition is not
so certain. Unless success be quick or, at all events, striking and clearly
associated with the performance of the ruling stratum—as was, for
instance, Germany’s success in 1870—exhaustion, economic, physical and
psychological may well produce, even in the case of victory, effects on the
relative position of classes, groups and parties that do not differ essentially
from those of defeat.

The First World War illustrates this. In the United States the effort had
not been sufficiently prolonged and exhausting to show it. Even here the
administration responsible for the war suffered a crushing defeat at the
polls. But in all other victorious countries the prestige of the ruling strata
and their hold on their people were impaired and not enhanced. For the
fortunes of the German and English socialist parties, this meant the advent
of power or, at all events, office. In Germany control of the central organs
of society was thrust upon the party: though in order to save doctrinal face
some of them as well as some anti-socialists insisted on speaking of a
revolution, the fact was that they undertook government by request—and
a humble request it was. In England the labor vote that had been at little
over half a million in January 1910 and not quite two millions and a
quarter in 1918, 7 went to 4,236,733 in 1922 and to 5,487,620 in 1924 
(8,362,594 in 1929). MacDonald reconquered the leadership and in 1924
the party came into office if not really into power. In France the structure
of the political world prevented any such clear-cut consummation, but the
general contours were the same: there was a syndicalist revival immediately
after the war, but the Confédération Générale du Travail, leaving the newly
founded Confédération Générale du Travail Syndicaliste and the
communist Confédération Générale du Travail Unitaire to absorb
inadaptable elements, discouraged revolutionary courses and slowly
prepared itself for a dominant political role.

Moreover, the socialist or quasi-socialist parties who then shouldered
the responsibility that came to them may well have felt that they had
almost a monopoly of many of the qualifications required in order to
make a success of their venture. Better than any other group they were
able to handle the masses that seethed with discontent. As the German
example shows, they even were in a better position than anyone else was
for the time being to deal firmly with revolutionary outbreaks—if need
be, by force. At any rate, they were the very people to administer the
right dose of social reform, to carry it on the one hand, and to make the
masses accept it on the other. Most important of all, they were, from their
standpoint, quite justified in believing that they were also the people to
heal the wounds the “imperialist war” had inflicted, to restore
international relations and to clear up the mess which, without any fault
of theirs, purely bourgeois governments had made of the peace. In this
they committed the same kind of error which from a different standpoint
was committed by their bourgeois competitors who believed in collective
security, the League of Nations, the reconstruction of gold currencies and
the removal of trade barriers. But once we grant the erroneous premise
we must also grant that the socialists were right in hoping for success,
particularly in the field of foreign policy.

2. The achievements of the two MacDonald governments—MacDonald’s
and Henderson’s work at the foreign office—are sufficient to illustrate this.
But the German case is still more significant. First of all, only the Social
Democrats were in a moral position to accept the peace treaty and to support
a policy that aimed at fulfilling its provisions. They lamented the national
catastrophe, of course, and the burdens it imposed. But feeling as they did
about military glory, neither the defeat itself nor the peace spelled unbearable
humiliation for them. Some of them almost subscribed to the Anglo-French
theory of the war. Most of them cared little for rearmament. While other
Germans looked on in sullen disgust, they worked for peaceful understanding

and the simplification of the electoral qualification. -->

with the victors in a spirit that was perfectly free, if not from resentment,
yet from passionate hatred. In the matter of what to others was an imposed
democracy, they even saw eye to eye with the western nations: having
disposed of the communist revolts in 1918–1919 and having by judicious
compromise acquired a dominant role in domestic politics, they were in their
most democratic mood.

Second, their hold on the masses was strong enough to make this attitude
politically effective. For the moment, a great part of the population saw
things in the same light. Their views of the situation and the right way of
dealing with it temporarily became the official view whatever the politics of
the government that happened to be in office. They provided the political
support for the coalitions which negotiated the Dawes plan and the Locarno
pact and which could never have been formed or, if formed, could never have
taken that line without them. Stresemann was no socialist. Yet the policy
associated with his name was the policy of the Social Democratic party—
the policy for which they were to get all the credit during one decade and
all the punishment in another.

Third, they were at an advantage in their relations to political opinion
abroad. The world knew little about Germany. But it understood two things:
on the one hand, it realized that there was a party that was ready to accept
for good many of the postwar arrangements and in fact quite approved of
some of them, a party that was the enemy of what France and England had
convinced themselves was their enemy; on the other hand, it realized that
German Social Democracy need not be feared on other counts—however
conservative a government might be, there was no need for it to object to
German as it did object to Russian socialism. 

In the long run this was a
weakness. It had much to do with the dilatory treatment dealt out to German
grievances, for it induced the foreign offices of England and France to
believe that Germany would remain indefinitely the meek petitioner who
could be made happy by assurances that some day he might be promoted to
a position of equality with the superior nations. In the short run, however,
and especially during the dark days of the Ruhr invasion, it was an asset:
the party—or rather governments known to depend on the support of the
party—had an entrée that would have been denied to others.

Fourth, there were the old contacts of the Social Democratic party with
the corresponding parties in other countries which dated from the Second
International. These contacts had not been completely severed by the war.
After all, the Second International had never been officially dissolved, and
many individuals and groups within it—especially, but by no means
exclusively, those of the neutral countries—had kept their internationalist
beliefs intact. The secretary (C. Huysmans) had continued to act, and in 1917, on the suggestion of the Scandinavian socialists, he had even made
an attempt to convene a congress which failed only because the Allied
powers, by that time determined to crush their adversary, refused to grant
passports. 8 Thus it was but natural that many socialists should have thought
of reviving it as a matter of course.

3. It was revived but not without difficulties. The first conferences that
were held for this purpose in 1919 and 1920 were only moderately
successful. The Communist (Third) International that had emerged
meanwhile (see below) exerted an attraction that proved a serious obstacle
to unity among the laborite and socialist parties of the world. And several
important groups that were in no mind to throw in their lot with the
communists still wanted something more up to date than the Second
International. 

This situation was met successfully by a clever tactical
device. On the initiative of the Austrian Socialists who were joined by the
German Independents and the English Independent Labor Party, a new
organization, the Workers’ International Union of Socialist Parties (the so-
called Vienna International), was formed in order to radicalize the groups
in the revived Second International, to restrain the groups that leaned too
much toward communism and to bring them both into line by judicious formulations of aims. 9

The meaning of the venture is exactly rendered by the sobriquet the
communists immediately found for it, the “International number two and
one-half.” That is precisely why it was able to serve the needs of the time.
At the Congress of Hamburg (1923) the Second and the Vienna
Internationals were united in order to form the Labor and Socialist
International, to stigmatize the peace as “imperialist” and to call for a united
front against international reaction—which at any rate sounded well—for the
eight-hour day and for international social legislation. The reduction of
Germany’s indemnity to a definite and reasonable figure, the abolishment of
interallied debts and the evacuation of German territory had been declared
necessary a year before (Frankfort Resolutions, 1922). In the light of
subsequent events we cannot fail to realize how great an achievement—and
service—that was.

<!-- 8 Before that there had actually been two conventions in Switzerland—at Zimmerwald
(1915) and at Kienthal (1916)—which acquired, contrary to the original intention I believe, a
different color owing to the fact that the attendance was not representative of the official parties.
I shall return briefly to them later on.

9 Some of those formulations would have done credit to any eighteenth-century diplomatist.
The great stumbling block was class war. The continental groups could not live without it, the
English could not live with it. So, when the merger was consummated at the Congress of
Hamburg, the Klassenkampf and the lutte des classes were retained in the German and French
texts but in the English text they were replaced by an unrecognizable circumlocution. -->
