1. Socialist parties had always had trouble with hyper-radical wings. 10

<!-- That such “leftist” groups should gain ground in the troubled days that
followed upon the war and that they should seize the opportunity to
acquire the status of distinct parties is no more surprising than that they
should follow classical usage and call themselves “communist” or that
they should display a much stronger internationalist slant than the official
parties did at the time.

Bear in mind that all this is completely independent of the Russian aspect
of the case. There would be communist parties and there would be a
Communist International if the tsars still reigned over Russia. But since the
Russian element became a factor in shaping the fortunes of both socialism
and communism all over the world—in fact, in shaping the social and
political history of our time—it is essential to restate how it developed and
to appraise its nature and importance. For this purpose we shall divide its
development into three stages. -->

2. Until the bolsheviks seized power in 1917, there was nothing Russian about the development of the communist groups except that the strongest man was a Russian with Mongol despotism

At the outbreak of the war:
- the Second International suspended itself via facti
- Lenin declared that:
  - it was dead
  - the time had come for more effective methods

It was natural for those who felt as he did to get together. 

Opportunity presented itself at the 2 conventions that were held in Switzerland, at Zimmerwald (1915) and at
Kienthal (1916).

<!-- 10 The splits that occurred in England and Germany over the war issue were of course a different matter and of only temporary importance. Even the German Spartacus League, founded in 1916 by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, though it went much further in its opposition to war than the Independents approved, took time to develop a definitely hostile attitude and even then did not go, officially at least, beyond insisting on the letter of the old Erfurt program. So far as I know, neither Liebknecht nor Mrs. Luxemburg ever completely severed contact with the party. The latter was one of the most relentless critics of bolshevist practice. -->


<!-- Since practically all of those who had espoused the causes
of their nations stayed away,  -->

The militants found it easy to rally to Lenin’s program of converting the imperialist war into an international revolution. 

<!-- There was more in this than a mere profession of faith in pristine Marxism and its Messianic promise. 

There was, with some of them, also the clear perception of the truth, to which the bourgeois of all countries were so completely blind, that the fabric of bourgeois society is unequal to the strains and stresses of prolonged “total” warfare and that breakdowns would occur at least in some countries. 

Beyond that however Lenin’s leadership was not accepted. 

Most of those who were present thought of convincing, bullying and using existing socialist parties rather than of destroying them.  -->

Lenin agreed that the international revolution was to be brought about by the individual actions of the national proletariats, and in the “advanced” countries first.

The second stage is from 1917 to 1927 from the rise of the bolsheviks to power in Russia to Trotsky’s expulsion from the Central Committee of the Bolshevik party (October 1927). 

That decade witnessed the emergence of communist parties and of a Communist (the “Third”) International. 

It also witnessed the (for the time being) definitive break with the socialist and laborite parties which, in the case of Germany, was embittered beyond remedy by the severely repressive measures adopted by the Social Democrats in power during the winter of 1918 to 1919. 

It witnessed the forging of the Russian chain.

But during the whole of that decade, the chain neither galled nor distorted. It must be remembered that the bolshevik conquest of the rule over the most backward of all the great nations was nothing but a fluke. 11 

To a certain extent Lenin himself recognized this. He repeated over and over again that final victory would be won only by the action of the revolutionary forces in more advanced countries and that this action was the really important thing. Of course he dictated to communists as he had done before, and he insisted on a strictly centralist organization of the Communist International—whose bureau took power to prescribe every move of the individual parties—but he did so in his role of communist leader and not in his role of Russian despot. 

That made all the difference. The headquarters of the International were in Moscow, the actual leader was Russian, but policy was directed in a thoroughly internationalist spirit, without any particular reference to Russian national interests and on principles with which the communists of all countries substantially agreed. Though the personal relation between the Bureau of the International and the Political Bureau of the Soviet power 12 was then much closer than it was later on, the two were nevertheless much more nearly distinct agencies. Thus the International itself and the individual parties did not behave differently than they would have behaved in the absence of the link with Russia.

<!-- 11 For this fluke, bolshevism was possibly indebted to the German general staff, by whose
orders Lenin was transported to Russia. If this should be thought an exaggeration of his personal
share in the events of 1917, there were enough other chance factors in the situation to teach us
the freakishness of this piece of history. -->

During that decade, therefore, the importance of the Russian connection, though great, did not amount to more than this. 

1. A communist group would have low quality and quantity of membership. But it had backing from the Russian Empire. 

<!-- might be and however little claim to being taken seriously it might have, it could bask in the glory reflected by that other group which had conquered an empire, and it could derive encouragement from such a backing.  -->

2. Bolshevist reality notwithstanding—the terror, the misery, the confession of failure implied in the adoption of the New Economic Policy after the Kronstadt revolt—it was henceforth possible to point to a socialist system that “worked.” 

The bolsheviks were masters in exploiting the fact that public opinion in England and the United States will swallow anything provided it is served up in the garb of familiar slogans. 

This of course also redounded to the advantage of the other communist parties. 

3. Communists believed in the imminence of a world revolution.

<!-- The Russian army meant as much to them as the army of Tsar Nicholas I had meant to the reactionary groups during the second quarter of the nineteenth century. 13 

In 1919 such hopes were less unreasonable and nearer to fulfillment than people are now prepared to believe. It is true that communist republics were actually established only in Bavaria and in Hungary. 14 -->

<!-- 12 In Lenin’s time, administrative authority was wielded by the Political Bureau, run by
Lenin himself, by the Military Council, Trotsky’s domain, and by the Cheka, then managed by
Dzerzhinsky. All three bodies were unknown to the constitution of the Soviet state, which vested
that authority in the “Soviet of the People’s Commissars.” Perhaps they should theoretically
be called organs of the party. But the party was the state.
13 It should be noticed that communists had dropped anti-militarism and noninterventionism
as easily as they had dropped democracy.
14 The Hungarian case (the government of Béla Kun) is highly instructive. The paralysis of
the upper classes and the indifference of the peasantry made it possible für a small group of
intellectuals to seize power without meeting significant resistance. They were a strange crowd—
some of them displaying (the same was true in Bavaria) unmistakably pathological symptoms—
and utterly unequal to this or any other serious task. But they had unbounded confidence in
themselves and their creed and no objection whatever to terrorist methods. And that proved quite
sufficient. They were allowed to stage their opera and might have gone on for an indefinite time
if the Allies had not permitted (or ordered) the Rumanian army to eject them.
 -->

But in Germany, Austria and Italy the social structure was perilously near toppling and there-is no saying what would have happened in those countries and possibly farther west if Trotsky’s war machine had been in working order at that time and not engaged in the civil and the Polish wars. 15

The Communist
International was founded in that atmosphere of impending life and death
struggle. Many things which acquired a different meaning afterwards—
such as the centralized management that has unlimited power over the
individual parties and deprives them of all freedom of action—may then
have seemed quite reasonable from that aspect.

The third stage I have dated from the expulsion of Trotsky (1927)
because this is a convenient landmark in the rise of Stalin to absolute
power. After that every actual decision in matters of policy seems to
have been his, though he still met some opposition in the Political
Bureau and elsewhere until the “trial” of Kamenew and Zinoviev (1936)
or even until Yezhov’s reign of terror (1937). For our purpose this
means that every decision was thenceforth the decision of a Russian
statesman acting on behalf of national Russian interests as seen from
the standpoint of a streamlined despotism. And this in turn, if correct,
defines what his attitude to the “Comintern” (the Communist
International) and to foreign communist parties must have been. 

They
became tools of Russian policy, taking rank within the huge arsenal of
such tools and being realistically evaluated relative to others according
to circumstances. Up to the present war which may revive it, the world
revolution was a frozen asset. The surviving veterans as well as the
neophytes of internationalist communism may have been contemptible.
But they were still of some use. They could preach the glories of the
Russian regime. They could serve as pins with which to prick hostile
governments. They increased the bargaining power of Russia. So it was
worth while to go to some trouble and expense in order to keep them
in subjection, to supervise them by agents of the secret police, and to
man the Comintern’s bureau with absolutely obsequious serfs who
would obey in fear and trembling.

3. In all this (and in lying about it) Stalin followed the established practice
of the ages. Most national governments have acted as he did and it is pure
hypocrisy to profess specific indignation in his case.

<!-- 15 Therefore it is doubtful whether it is correct to say that the western powers acted foolishly
and inefficiently in supporting in a half-hearted way the various counterrevolutions that were
attempted in Russia, particularly the Denikin and Wrangel ventures. It seems to me that,
whether by a shrewd appraisal of the situation or by luck, they attained exactly what they could
have wished: they neutralized the Soviet power at a crucial moment and thus stopped the
advance of bolshevism. Less than this would have endangered their own social systems; more
than this would have involved prolonged, costly and perhaps unprofitable efforts that might
easily have defeated their aims. -->

The most obvious examples are afforded by the practice of governments
who espoused a religious creed. As long as the respective creeds were
sufficiently vital to motivate action, these governments often used foreign
groups of the same creed for their purposes. But, as the history of the years
from 1793 to 1815 is sufficient to prove, the practice is much more general
than these examples suggest. No less standardized is the reaction—
phraseological and other—by the governments which are affected by it:
politicians of all types and classes are happy to seize the opportunity of
calling an opponent a traitor.

But for the communist parties outside of Russia it was a serious matter
to receive orders from a caput mortuum in the hands of a modernized tsar.
Their abject servility raises two questions, one as to its causes and another
as to its possible bearing on the future character and fate of revolutionary
socialism.

The first question is perhaps less difficult to answer than it seems. All we
have to do is to put ourselves in the communist’s chair and, taking account
of his type, look at his situation in a practical spirit. He would not object to
the Stalin regime on humanitarian considerations. He may even glory in the
slaughter—some neurasthenic degenerates do, and others, the communists
from failure and resentment, experience satisfaction at the sufferings of a
certain class of victims. Moreover, why should he resent cruelties that do not
prevent thoroughly bourgeois people from idolizing the regime? Why should
he, on that ground, condemn bolshevism when the Dean of Canterbury does
not? 16 Why indeed?

Again, there was hardly any reason for communists to object on the
ground of Thermidorism. This phrase was first used by the opponents of the
New Economic Policy but Trotsky adopted it later in order to stigmatize
Stalin’s regime as “reactionary” in the sense in which the action of the men
who overthrew Robespierre in 1794 was “reactionary.” But it is completely
meaningless. After all, it was Stalin who collectivized agriculture,
“liquidated” the Kulaks, reversed the New Economic Policy. In fact, like a
good tactician, he suppressed opposition and substantially carried out the
opposition’s program.


Finally, what the protecting power does at home is not of primary
importance to the communist in another country as long as that power
plays fair with him. And even if it does not play fair with him, what is
16 The sentiments expressed in the book by that ecclesiastic cannot be defended on the
ground that the principles of the “Russian experiment” are one thing and the mode of its
execution is another thing. For the really terrible point about the Stalin regime is not what it
did to millions of victims but the fact that it had to do it if it wished to survive. In other words,
those principles and that practice are inseparable.

he to do? The chain tightened and galled. But it also supported. The
socialist parties would not have accepted him. The normal healthy-
minded workman turned from him with a groan. He would have been at
loose ends like Trotsky. He was in no position to do without the chain, 17
and in accepting his slavery he may have hoped—he may still hope—that
junctures will arise in which he may be able to pull it his way…after the
present World War perhaps…

The last point goes some way toward answering the second question.
Certainly there is a possibility that Russian despotism will spread over the
ruins of European civilization—or even beyond them—and that in this case
the communist parties all over the world will be turned into Russian
garrisons. But there are many other possibilities. And one of them is that the
Russian regime will founder in the process or that in spreading over other
countries it will acquire traits more congenial to the individual national soils.
A special case of this kind would be that in the end the Russian element will
have changed nothing in the future character of revolutionary socialism. To
bank on this is no doubt risky. But it is not as foolish as it is to hope that
our civilization will emerge unscathed from the present conflagration—
unless of course this conflagration subsides more quickly than we have a
right to expect.
