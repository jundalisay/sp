If a physicist observes that the same mechanism works differently at different times and places, he concludes that its functioning depends on extraneous conditions.

These conditions are as it was to see what the conditions were under which the classical doctrine of democracy might be expected to fit reality to an acceptable degree.

This conclusion definitely commits us to that strictly, relativist view that
has been indicated all along. 

Exactly as there is no case for or against
socialism at all times and in all places, so there is no absolutely general
case for or against the democratic method. And exactly as with socialism,
this makes it difficult to argue by means of a ceteris paribus clause, for
“other things” cannot be equal as between situations in which democracy
is a workable, or the only workable, arrangement and situations in which
it is not. 

Democracy thrives in social patterns that display certain characteristics and it might well be doubted whether there is any sense in asking how it would fare in others that lack those characteristics—or how
the people in those other patterns would fare with it. The conditions which
I hold must be fulfilled for the democratic method to be a success 5 —in
societies in which it is possible for it to work at all—I shall group under
four headings; and I shall confine myself to the great industrial nations of
the modern type.

The first condition is that the human material of politics—the people who
man the party machines, are elected to serve in parliament, rise to cabinet
office—should be of sufficiently high quality. This means more than that
individuals of adequate ability and moral character must exist in sufficient
numbers. As has been pointed out before, the democratic method selects not
simply from the population but only from those elements of the population
that are available for the political vocation or, more precisely, that offer
themselves for election. All methods of selection do this of course. All of
them therefore may, according to the degree to which a given vocation
attracts talent and character, produce in it a level of performance that is above
or below the national average. But the competitive struggle for responsible
office is, on the one hand, wasteful of personnel and energy. On the other
hand, the democratic process may easily create conditions in the political
sector that, once established, will repel most of the men who can make a
success at anything else. For both these reasons, adequacy of material is
particularly important for the success of democratic government. It is not true
that in a democracy people always have the kind and quality of government
they want or merit.

<!-- 5 By “success” I mean no more than that the democratic process reproduce itself steadily
without creating situations that enforce resort to non-democratic methods and that it cope with
current problems in a way which all interests that count politically find acceptable in the long
run. I do not mean that every observer, from his own individual standpoint, need approve of
the results. -->


There may be many ways in which politicians of sufficiently good quality can be secured. Thus far however, experience seems to suggest that the only
effective guarantee is in the existence of a social stratum, itself a product of
a severely selective process, that takes to politics as a matter of course. If
such a stratum be neither too exclusive nor too easily accessible for the
outsider and if it be strong enough to assimilate most of the elements it
currently absorbs, it not only will present for the political career products
of stocks that have successfully passed many tests in other fields—served,
as it were, an apprenticeship in private affairs—but it will also increase their
fitness by endowing them with traditions that embody experience, with a
professional code and with a common fund of views.

It is hardly mere coincidence that England, which is the only country
to fulfill our condition completely, is also the only country to have a
political society in this sense. Still more instructive is the case of Germany
in the period of the Weimar Republic (1918–1933). As I hope to show in
Part V, there was nothing about the German politicians of that period that
would ordinarily be considered a glaring defect. The average member of
parliament and the average prime and cabinet minister were honest,
reasonable and conscientious. This applies to all parties. However, with due
respect for the sprinkling of talent that showed here and there, though
rarely in a position of or near high command, it must be added that most
of them were distinctly below par, in some cases pitifully so. Obviously
this cannot have been due to any lack of ability and energy in the nation
as a whole. But ability and energy spurned the political career. And there
was no class or group whose members looked upon politics as their
predestined career. That political system missed fire for many reasons. But
the fact that eventually it met smashing defeat at the hands of an anti-
democratic leader is nevertheless indicative of the lack of inspiring
democratic leadership

The second condition for the success of democracy is that the effective
range of political decision should not be extended too far. How far it can be
extended depends not only on the general limitations of the democratic
method which follow from the analysis presented in the preceding section
but also on the particular circumstances of each individual case. To put this
more concretely: the range does not only depend, for instance, on the kind
and quantity of matters that can be successfully handled by a government
subject to the strain of an incessant struggle for its political life; it also
depends, at any given time and place, on the quality of the men who form
that government and on the type of political machine and the pattern of
public opinion they have to work with. From the standpoint of our theory
of democracy it is not necessary to require, as it would be from the
standpoint of the classical theory, that only such matters should be dealt with by the political apparatus which the people at large can fully understand and
have a serious opinion about. 

But a less exacting requirement of the same
nature still imposes itself. It calls for additional comment.
Of course there cannot be any legal limits to what a parliament, led by
the prime minister, might subject to its decision, if need be, by means of a
constitutional amendment. But, so Edmund Burke argued in discussing the
behavior of the English government and Parliament with respect to the
American colonies, in order to function properly that all-powerful parliament
must impose limits upon itself. Similarly we may argue that, even within the
range of matters that have to be submitted to parliamentary vote, it is often
necessary for government and parliament to pass measures on which their
decision is purely formal or, at most, of a purely supervisory nature.
Otherwise the democratic method may turn out legislative freaks. Take for
instance the case of so bulky and so technical a measure as a criminal code.
The democratic method will apply to the question whether or not a country
is to have such a codification at all. It will also apply to certain “issues” that
the government may choose to select for political decision which is more
than formal—for instance, whether certain practices of labor or employers’
associations should or should not be considered criminal. But for the rest,
government and parliament will have to accept the specialists’ advice
whatever they may think themselves. For crime is a complex phenomenon.
The term in fact covers many phenomena that have very little in common.
Popular slogans about it are almost invariably wrong. And a rational
treatment of it requires that legislation in this matter should be protected
from both the fits of vindictiveness and the fits of sentimentality in which
the laymen in the government and in the parliament are alternatingly prone
to indulge. This is what I meant to convey by stressing the limitations upon
the effective range of political decision—the range within which politicians
decide in truth as well as in form.

Again, the condition in question can indeed be fulfilled by a
corresponding limitation of the activities of the state. But it would be a
serious misunderstanding if the reader thought that such a limitation is
necessarily implied. Democracy does not require that every function of the
state be subject to its political method. For instance, in most democratic
countries a large measure of independence from political agencies is granted
to the judges. Another instance is the position held by the Bank of England
until 1914. Some of its functions were in fact of a public nature. Nevertheless
these functions were vested with what legally was just a business corporation
that was sufficiently independent of the political sector to have a policy of
its own. Certain federal agencies in this country are other cases in point. 

The Interstate Commerce Commission embodies an attempt to extend the sphere of public authority without extending the sphere of political decision. Or, to present still another example, certain of our states finance state universities
“without any strings,” that is to say, without interfering with what in some
cases amounts to practically complete autonomy.

Thus, almost any type of human affairs may conceivably be made to enter
the sphere of the state without becoming part of the material of the
competitive struggle for political leadership beyond what is implied in
passing the measure that grants the power and sets up the agency to wield
it and the contact that is implied in the government’s role of general
supervisor. It is of course true that this supervision may degenerate into
vitiating influence. The politician’s power to appoint the personnel of non-
political public agencies, if remorselessly used, will often suffice in itself to
corrupt them. But that does not affect the principle in question.

As a third condition, democratic government in modern industrial society must be able to command, for all purposes the sphere of public
activity is to include—no matter whether this be much or little—the
services of a well-trained bureaucracy of good standing and tradition,
endowed with a strong sense of duty and a no less strong esprit de corps.
Such a bureaucracy is the main answer to the argument about government
by amateurs. Potentially it is the only answer to the question so often heard
in this country: democratic politics has proved itself unable to produce
decent city government; how can we expect the nation to fare if everything,
eventually including the whole of the productive process, is to be handed
over to it?

Finally, it is also the principal answer to the question about
how our second condition can be fulfilled 6 whenever the sphere of public
control is wide.

It is not enough that the bureaucracy should be efficient in current
administration and competent to give advice. It must also be strong enough
to guide and, if need be, to instruct the politicians who head the ministries.
In order to be able to do this it must be in a position to evolve principles of
its own and sufficiently independent to assert them. It must be a power in
its own right. This amounts to saying that in fact though not in form
appointment, tenure and promotion must depend largely—within civil service
rules that politicians hesitate to violate—on its own corporate opinion in spite
of all the clamor that is sure to arise whenever politicians or the public find
themselves crossed by it as they frequently must.



<!-- 6 Reference to some comments on the subject of bureaucracy in ch. xviii will convince
the reader that, in all three respects, the answer provided by bureaucracy is not held to be
ideal in any sense. On the other hand readers should not allow themselves to be unduly
influenced by the associations the term carries in popular parlance. In any case that answer
is the only realistic one. -->

Again, as in the case of the personnel of politics, the question of the available human material is all-important. Training though essential is
quite secondary to this. And again, both requisite material and the
traditional code necessary for the functioning of an official class of this
kind can be most easily secured if there is a social stratum of adequate
quality and corresponding prestige that can. be drawn upon for recruits—
not too rich, not too poor, not too exclusive, not too accessible. 

The bureaucracies of Europe, in spite of the fact that they have drawn enough
hostile criticism to blur their records, ex-emplify very well what I am
trying to convey. They are the product of a long development that started
with the ministeriales of medieval magnates (originally serfs selected for
administrative and military purposes who thereby acquired the status of
petty nobles) and went on through the centuries until the powerful engine
emerged which we behold today. It cannot be created in a hurry. It cannot
be “hired” with money. But it grows everywhere, whatever the political
method a nation may adopt. Its expansion is the one certain thing about
our future.

The fourth set of conditions may be summed up in the phrase Democratic
Self-control. Everybody will of course agree that the democratic method
cannot work smoothly unless all the groups that count in a nation are willing
to accept any legislative measure as long as it is on the statute book and all
executive orders issued by legally competent authorities. But democratic self-
control implies much more than this.

Above all, electorates and parliaments must be on an intellectual and
moral level high enough to be proof against the offerings of the crook and
the crank, or else men who are neither will be driven into the ways of both.
Moreover, miscarriages that will discredit democracy and undermine
allegiance to it may also occur if measures are passed without regard to the
claims of others or to the national situation. The individual proposals for
legislative reform or executive action must, as it were, be content to stand
in an orderly breadline; they must not attempt to rush the shop. Recalling
what has been said in the preceding chapter about the modus operandi of
the democratic method, the reader will realize that this involves a lot of
voluntary subordination.
In particular, politicians in parliament must resist the temptation to upset
or embarrass the government each time they could do so. No successful
policy is possible if they do this. This means that the supporters of the
government must accept its lead and allow it to frame and act upon a
program and that the opposition should accept the lead of the “shadow
cabinet” at its head and allow it to keep political warfare within certain rules.
Fulfillment of this requirement, habitual violation of which spells the
beginning of the end of a democracy, will be seen to call for just the right amount—not too much, not too little—of traditionalism. To protect this
traditionalism is in fact one of the purposes for which rules of parliamentary
procedure and etiquette exist.

The voters outside of parliament must respect the division of labor
between themselves and the politicians they elect. They must not withdraw
confidence too easily between elections and they must understand that, once
they have elected an individual, political action is his business and not theirs.
This means that they must refrain from instructing him about what he is to
do—a principle that has indeed been universally recognized by constitutions
and political theory ever since Edmund Burke’s time. But its implications
are not generally understood. On the one hand, few people realize that this
principle clashes with the classical doctrine of democracy and really spells
its abandonment. For if the people are to rule in the sense of deciding
individual issues, what could be more natural for them to do than to issue
instructions to their representatives as the voters for the French States-
General did in and before 1789? On the other hand, it is still less recognized
that if the principle be accepted, not only instructions as formal as those
French cahiers but also less formal attempts at restricting the freedom of
action of members of parliament—the practice of bombarding them with
letters and telegrams for instance—ought to come under the same ban.
We cannot enter into the various delicate problems which this raises
concerning the true nature of democracy as defined by us. All that matters
here is that successful democratic practice in great and complicated
societies has invariably been hostile to political back-seat driving—to the
point of resorting to secret diplomacy and lying about intentions and
commitments—and that it takes a lot of self-control on the part of the
citizen to refrain from it.

Finally, effective competition for leadership requires a large measure of
tolerance for difference of opinion. It has been pointed out before that this
tolerance never is and never can be absolute. But it must be possible for
every would-be leader who is not lawfully excluded to present his case
without producing disorder. And this may imply that people stand by
patiently while somebody is attacking their most vital interests or offending
their most cherished ideals—or as an alternative, that the would-be leader
who holds such views restrains himself correspondingly. Neither is possible
without genuine respect for the opinions of one’s fellow citizens amounting
to a willingness to subordinate one’s own opinions.

Every system can stand deviating practice to a certain extent. But even
the necessary minimum of democratic self-control evidently requires a
national character and national habits of a certain type which have not
everywhere had the opportunity to evolve and which the democratic method itself cannot be relied on to produce. And nowhere will that self-
control stand tests beyond a varying degree of severity. In fact the reader
need only review our conditions in order to satisfy himself that democratic
government will work to full advantage only if all the interests that matter
are practically unanimous not only in their allegiance to the country but
also in their allegiance to the structural principles of the existing society.
Whenever these principles are called in question and issues arise that rend
a nation into two hostile camps, democracy works at a disadvantage. And
it may cease to work at all as soon as interests and ideals are involved on
which people refuse to compromise.


This may be generalized to read that the democratic method will be at a
disadvantage in troubled times. In fact, democracies of all types recognize
with practical unanimity that there are situations in which it is reasonable
to abandon competitive and to adopt monopolistic leadership. In ancient
Rome a non-elective office conferring such a monopoly of leadership in
emergencies was provided for by the constitution. The incumbent was called
magister populi or dictator. Similar provisions are known to practically all
constitutions, our own included: the President of the United States acquires
in certain conditions a power that makes him to all intents and purposes a
dictator in the Roman sense, however great the differences are both in legal
construction and in practical details. If the monopoly is effectively limited
either to a definite time (as it originally was in Rome) or to the duration of
a definite short-run emergency, the democratic principle of competitive
leadership is merely suspended. If the monopoly, either in law or in fact, is
not limited as to time—and if not limited as to time it will of course tend to
become unlimited as to everything else—the democratic principle is
abrogated and we have the case of dictatorship in the present-day sense. 7
