My definition agrees with all the others.

It turns on an exclusively economic point. 

Every socialist wishes to revolutionize society from the economic angle and all the blessings he expects are to come through a change in
economic institutions. This of course implies a theory about social
causation—the theory that the economic pattern is the really operative
element in the sum total of the phenomena that we call society. 

1. With reference to socialism, neither for us, the observers, nor for the people that are to put their trust in socialism, is the economic aspect the only or even the most important one.

<!-- 1 Price, in modern theory, is defined as a mere coefficient of transformation. Cost, in
the sense of opportunity cost, is a general logical category. We shall however soon return
to this. -->

<!-- In defining as I did, I did not intend to deny that. And in fairness to all the
civilized socialists whom I have ever met or read, it should be stated that
the same holds true for them: that  -->

Socialists stress the economic element because of the causative importance their creed attributes to it.

They do not mean to
suggest that nothing is worth struggling for except beefsteaks and radios.
There are indeed insufferable stick-in-the-muds who mean precisely that And
many who are not stick-in-the-muds will nevertheless, in the hunt for votes,
emphasize the economic promise because of its immediate appeal. In doing
so they distort and degrade their creed. We will not do the same. Instead we
will keep in mind that socialism aims at higher goals than full bellies, exactly
as Christianity means more than the somewhat hedonistic values of heaven
and hell.

1. Socialism means a new cultural world. For the sake of it, one might conceivably be a fervent socialist even though believing
that the socialist arrangement is likely to be inferior as to economic
performance. 2 Hence no merely economic argument for or against can ever
be decisive, however successful in itself.

2. What cultural world? We might try to answer this question
by surveying the actual professions of accredited socialists in order to see
whether a type emerges from them. At first sight, the material seems to be
abundant. 

Some socialists are ready enough, with folded hands and the smile
of the blessed on their lips, to chant the canticle of justice, equality, freedom
in general and freedom from “the exploitation of man by man” in particular,
of peace and love, of fetters broken and cultural energies unchained, of new
horizons opened, of new dignities revealed. But that is Rousseau adulterated
with some Bentham. Others simply voice the interests and appetites of the
radical wing of trade unionism. Still others, however, are remarkably reticent.
Because they despise cheap slogans but cannot think of anything else?
Because, though they do think of something else, they doubt its popular
appeal? Because they know that they differ hopelessly with their comrades?
So we cannot proceed on this line. Instead we have to face what I shall
refer to as the Cultural Indeterminateness of Socialism. In fact, according to
our definition as well as to most others, a society may be fully and truly
socialist and yet be led by an absolute ruler or be organized in the most
democratic of all possible ways; it may be aristocratic or proletarian; it may
be a theocracy and hierarchic or atheist or indifferent as to religion; it may
be much more strictly disciplined than men are in a modern army or
completely lacking in discipline; it may be ascetic or eudemonist in spirit;
energetic or slack; thinking only of the future or only of the day; warlike
and nationalist or peaceful and internationalist; equalitarian or the opposite;

<!-- 2 The reverse is also true of course: one might concede the economic claims made on behalf
of socialism and yet hate it on cultural grounds. -->


it may have the ethics of lords or the ethics of slaves; its art may be
subjective or objective; 3 its forms of life individualistic or standardized;
and—what for some of us would by itself suffice to command our allegiance
or to arouse our contempt—it may breed from its supernormal or from its
subnormal stock and produce supermen or submen accordingly.

Why is this so? Well, the reader may have his choice. He may say either
that Marx is wrong and that the economic pattern does not determine a
civilization or else that the complete economic pattern would determine it
but that, without the aid of further economic data and assumptions, the
element that constitutes socialism in our sense does not. We should not
have fared any better with capitalism, by the way, had we tried to
reconstruct its cultural world from nothing but the facts embodied in our
definition of it. We have in this case no doubt an impression of
determinateness and find it possible to reason on tendencies in capitalist
civilization. But this is only because we have a historic reality before us
that supplies us with all the additional data we need and via facti excludes
an infinite number of possibilities.

We have, however, used the word determinateness in a rather strict and
technical sense and, moreover, with reference to a whole cultural world.
Indeterminateness in this sense is no absolute bar to attempts at
discovering certain features or tendencies that the socialist arrangement
as such may be more likely to produce than others, especially features
of, and tendencies in, particular spots of the cultural organism. 

Nor is it
impossible to frame reasonable additional assumptions. This much is
obvious from the above survey of possibilities. If, for instance, we
believe as many socialists do—wrongly, as I think—that wars are nothing
but one of the forms of the conflict of capitalist interests, it readily
follows that socialism would be pacifist and not warlike. 

Or if we assume
that socialism evolves along with, and is inseparable from, a certain type
of rationalism we shall conclude that it is likely to be irreligious if not
anti-religious. We shall ourselves try our hand at this game here and
there, although in the main we had better yield the floor to the only truly
great performer in that field, Plato. 

But all this does not do away with
the fact that socialism is indeed a cultural Proteus and that its cultural
possibilities can be made more definite only if we resign ourselves to
speaking of special cases within the socialist genus—each of which to
be sure will be the only true one for the man who stands for it but any
one of which may be in store for us.

<!-- 3 Paradoxical as it sounds, individualism and socialism are not necessarily opposites. One
may argue that the socialist form of organization will guarantee “truly” individualistic
realization of personality. This would in fact be quite in the Marxian line. -->
