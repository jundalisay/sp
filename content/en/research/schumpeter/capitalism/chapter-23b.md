Parliament is in session, he is lucky if he has a couple of hours in the morning left for thinking things over and for real work. Individual miscarriages and defeats of a government as a whole are not infrequently due to physical exhaustion of the leading man or men. 4 How could he, so it might well be asked, undertake to lead and supervise an administrative organism that is to embrace all the problems of economic life?

But this wastage of governmental energy is not all. The incessant
competitive struggle to get into office or to stay in it imparts to every
consideration of policies and measures the bias so admirably expressed by
the phrase about “dealing in votes.” The fact that in a democracy government
must attend primarily to the political values of a policy or a bill or an
administrative act—that is to say, the very fact that enforces the democratic
principle of the government’s dependence upon the voting of parliament and
of the electorate—is likely to distort all the pro’s and con’s. In particular, it
forces upon the men at or near the helm a short-run view and makes it
extremely difficult for them to serve such long-run interests of the nation as
may require consistent work for far-off ends; foreign policy, for instance, is
in danger of degenerating into domestic politics. And it makes it no less
difficult to dose measures rationally. The dosing that a government decides
on with an eye to its political chances is not necessarily the one that will
produce the results most satisfactory to the nation.

Thus the prime minister in a democracy might be likened to a horseman
who is so fully engrossed in trying to keep in the saddle that he cannot plan
his ride, or to a general so fully occupied with making sure that his army will
accept his orders that he must leave strategy to take care of itself. And this
remains true (and must, in the case of some countries such as France and Italy,
be frankly recognized as one of the sources from which anti-democratic feeling
has spread) in spite of the facts that may be invoked in extenuation.
There is, to begin with, the fact that the instances in which those
consequences show to an extent that may be felt to be unbearable can often
be explained on the ground that the social pattern is not up to the task of
working democratic institutions. As the examples of France and Italy show,
this may happen in countries that are much more civilized than some which do succeed in that task. But nevertheless the weight of the criticism is
thereby reduced to the statement that the satisfactory working of the
democratic method is contingent upon fulfillment of certain conditions—a
subject that will be taken up presently.


<!-- 4 To give a portentous example: no student of the origins, of the World War of 1914–1918
can fail to be struck by the passivity of the English government from the murder of the
Archduke to the declarations of war. Not that no efforts were made to avoid the conflagration.
But they were singularly ineffective and fell far short of what could have been done. It is of
course possible to explain this on the theory that the Asquith government did not really wish
to avoid the war. But if this theory be considered unsatisfactory, as I think it should be, then
we are driven back upon another: it is just possible that the gentlemen on the treasury bench
were so absorbed in their political game that they did not wake up to the dangers of the
international situation until it was too late. -->

Then there is the question of the alternative. These weaknesses are
obviously not absent in non-democratic patterns. Paving one’s way to a
leading position, say, at a court, may absorb quite as much energy and
distort one’s views about issues quite as much as does the democratic
struggle though that waste or distortion does not stand out so publicly. This
amounts to saying that attempts at comparative appraisal of engines of
government will have to take account of many other factors besides the
institutional principles involved.

Moreover, some of us will reply to the critic that a lower level of
governmental efficiency may be exactly what we want. We certainly do not
want to be the objects of dictatorial efficiency, mere material for deep games.
Such a thing as the Gosplan may at present be impossible in the United
States. But does not this prove precisely that, just like the Russian Gosplan,
its hypothetical analogue in this country would violate the spirit as well as
the organic structure of the commonwealth?

Finally, something can be done to reduce the pressure on the leading men
by appropriate institutional devices. The American arrangement for instance
shows up to advantage on this point. The American “prime minister” must
no doubt keep his eye on his political chessboard. But he need not feel
responsible for every individual measure. And, not sitting in Congress, he
is at least exempt from the physical strain this would involve. He has all the
opportunity he wants to nurse his strength.

Third, our analysis in the preceding chapter brings into bold relief the
problem of the quality of the men the democratic method selects for
positions of leadership. The well-known argument about this hardly needs
recalling: the democratic method creates professional politicians whom
it then turns into amateur administrators and “statesmen.” Themselves
lacking all the acquirements necessary for dealing with the tasks that
confront them, they appoint Lord Macaulay’s “judges without law and
diplomatists without French,” ruining the civil service and discouraging
all the best elements in it. Worse still, there is another point, distinct from
any question of specialized competence and experience: the qualities of
intellect and character that make a good candidate are not necessarily
those that make a good administrator, and selection by means of success
at the polls may work against the people who would be successes at the
head of affairs. And even if the products of this selection prove successes
in office these successes may well be failures for the nation. The politician who is a good tactician can successfully survive any number
of administrative miscarriages.

Recognition of the elements of truth in all this should again be tempered
by the recognition of the extenuating facts. In particular, the case for
democracy stands to gain from a consideration of the alternatives: no system
of selection whatever the social sphere—with the possible exception of
competitive capitalism—tests exclusively the ability to perform and selects in
the way a stable selects its Derby crack. Though to varying degrees, all systems
put premiums on other qualities as well, qualities that are often inimical to
performance. But we may perhaps go further than this. It is not quite true that
in the average case political success proves nothing for a man or that the
politician is nothing but an amateur. There is one very important thing that he
knows professionally, viz., the handling of men. And, as a broad rule at least,
the ability to win a position of political leadership will be associated with a
certain amount of personal force and also of other aptitudes that will come in
usefully in a prime minister’s workshop. There are after all many rocks in the
stream that carries politicians to national office which are not entirely
ineffective in barring the progress of the moron or the windbag.

That in such matters general argument one way or another does not lead
to a definite result is only what we should expect. It is much more curious
and significant that factual evidence is not, at first sight at least, any more
conclusive. Nothing is easier than to compile an impressive list of failures
of the democratic method, especially if we include not only cases in which
there was actual breakdown or national discomfiture but also those in which,
though the nation led a healthy and prosperous life, the performance in the
political sector was clearly substandard relative to the performance in others.
But it is just as easy to marshal hardly less impressive evidence in favor of
the politician. To cite one outstanding illustration: It is true that in antiquity
war was not so technical an affair as it has become of late. Yet one would
think that the ability to make a success at it had even then very little to do
with the ability to get oneself elected to political office. All the Roman
generals of the republican era however were politicians and all of them got
their commands directly through the elective offices they held or had
previously held. Some of the worst disasters were due to this. But on the
whole, these politician-soldiers did remarkably well.
Why is that so? There can be only one answer to this question.
