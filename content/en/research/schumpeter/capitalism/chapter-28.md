PART V
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties

PROLOGUE
IT IS not for me to write a history of the socialist parties. Both the settings
in which they rose and fell and the ways in which they grappled with their
problems call for a larger canvas and a mightier brush than mine. Also, the
time has not yet come to make the attempt: though the last twenty years have
brought up many valuable monographs that shed all the light we need on
particular situations or phases, a vast amount of research has still to be done
before a history of modern socialism in action can be written that will meet
the requirements of scholarship. But certain facts are necessary in order to
complement and to put into the proper perspective much of what has been
said in the preceding parts of this book. And some other points that have
occurred to me from study or personal observation1 I wish to present because
they seem to be interesting on their own account. For this double purpose I
have assembled the fragments that are to follow, in the hope that even
fragments may indicate the contours of the whole.
Not every reader—not even every socialist reader—will approve of the central
position this fragment gives to Marx and Marxism. I readily confess to personal
bias in the matter. For me, the fascinating thing about socialist policy—the thing
that gives it a special claim to attention and a dignity all its own that is both
intellectual and moral—is its clear and close relation to a doctrinal basis. In
principle at least, it is theory implemented by action or inaction turning on the
true or false perception of a historical necessity. (See Part I.) Even considerations
of expediency and mere tactics carry that character indelebilis and always have
been discussed in the light of that principle. But all this is true only of the
Marxian streak; no truer, of course, than it is, within the bourgeois compound,
of the Benthamite radicals—the “philosophical” radicals as they were
significantly called. All non-Marxian socialist groups are more or less like other
groups and parties; only Marxists of pure persuasion consistently walked in the
light of a doctrine that to them contained all answers to all questions. As will
be seen, I do not admire this attitude unconditionally. It may well be called
narrow and even naïve. But the doctrinaires of all types, whatever their practical
disabilities, have certain esthetic qualities that raise them high above the common
run of political practitioners. Also they command sources of strength which mere
practitioners will never be able to understand.
1 One of these points has been dealt with elsewhere. See ch. xx.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE NONAGE
S OCIALIST doctrines, in some of their roots presumably as old as
articulate thought, were dreams, beautiful or hateful—impotent longings
out of contact with social realities—so long as they lacked the means to
convince anybody that the social process worked for the realization of
socialism. Socialist effort amounted to preaching in the desert so long as it had
no established contact with an existing or potential source of social power—
to preaching of the Platonic type about which no politician need bother and
which no observer of social processes need list among operative factors.
This is the gist of Marx’s criticism of most of the socialists who preceded
him or in his day offered competitive teaching, and the reason why he called
them Utopian. The point was not so much that many of their schemes were
obviously freaks or otherwise below par intellectually, but that those schemes
were essentially unimplemented and unimplementable. A few examples will
illustrate this and will stand instead of a survey of a large body of literature.
Also they will suffice to show how far Marx’s judgment was wrong.
Sir Thomas More’s (1478–1535) Utopia, read, admired and even
copied right into the nineteenth century—witness the success of Cabet
and of Bellamy—unfolds the picture of a frugal, moral and equalitarian
society that was the exact opposite of English society in More’s day. This
ideal may be but the literary form of social criticism. Perhaps we need
not accept it for a presentation of More’s opinion about the aims of
practical social planning. However, if it be understood in the latter
sense—and so it was—the trouble with it does not lie in its
impracticability. In some respects it is less impracticable than are certain
present-day forms of idyllic socialism. For instance, it faces the question
of authority and it frankly accepts the prospect—exalted no doubt into a
virtue—of a modest standard of life. The real trouble is that there is no
attempt to show how society is to evolve toward that ideal state (except
possibly by conversion) or what the real factors are that might be worked
upon in order to produce it. We can like or dislike the ideal. But we
cannot do much about it. To put the practical dot on the i, there is nothing
in it on which to found a party and to provide a program.
Another type may be instanced by Robert Owen’s (1771–1858) socialism.
A manufacturer and practical reformer, he was not content to conceive—or
The Nonage 307
adopt—the idea of small self-sufficing communities, producing and
consuming their means of livelihood according to communist principles in
the word’s boldest acceptance. He actually went about realizing it. First he
hoped for government action, then he tried the effect of setting an example.
So it might seem that the plan was more operational than More’s: there was
not only an ideal but also a bridge leading to it. Actually however that kind
of bridge only serves to illustrate more precisely the nature of utopianism.
For both government action and individual efforts are introduced as dei ex
machina—the thing would have had to be done just because some agent
thought it worth while. No social force working toward the goal was
indicated or could have been indicated. No soil was provided for the rose
trees—they were left to feed on beauty. 1
The same applies to Proudhon’s (1809–1865) anarchism, except that in
his case definite economic error is much more in evidence than it is with
most of the other classics of anarchism who despised economic argument
and, whether stressing the ideal of free and stateless cooperation of
individuals or the task of destruction to be accomplished in order to make
way for it, avoided errors of reasoning largely by avoiding reasoning. Like
“poet, lunatic and lover of imagination all compact,” they were
constitutionally unable to do anything except to upset socialist applecarts and
to add to confusion in situations of revolutionary excitement. It is not
difficult to sympathize with Marx’s disgust, that sometimes was not unmixed
with despair, at the doings of M.Bakunin.
But anarchism was utopianism with a vengeance. The pathological species
has been mentioned only in order to make it quite clear that such revivals
of fourteenth-century mentality should not be confused with the genuine
brand of Utopian socialism which St. Simon’s (1760–1825) writings display
at its best. There we find sense and responsibility coupled with considerable
analytic power. The goal envisaged was not absurd or visionary. What was
lacking was the way: again the only method suggested was government
action—action by governments that at the time were essentially bourgeois.
If this view be accepted, the great break that put an end to the nonage of
socialism must in fact be associated with the name and work of Karl Marx.
1 The same is true of the similar plan of Charles Fourier (1772–1837) which will not
however be called socialist by everyone, since labor was to receive only 5/12 of the social
product, the rest going to capital and management. Though in itself this was a meritorious
attempt to take account of realities, it is amusing to note that labor would in that ideal state of
things have done worse than it actually does in capitalist society. In prewar England for instance
(see A.Bowley, The Division of the Product of Industry, 1921, p. 37), wages and salaries under
£160 absorbed, in manufacturing and mining, 62 per cent of the value of net output or, counting
in salaries above £160, 68 per cent. Of course Fourier’s ideals were not primarily economic,
but as far as they were, they illustrate well how large an element of ignorance about capitalist
facts enters into reformist creeds
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties308
We may then date it, so far as in such matters dating is possible at all, by
the issue of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) or by the
foundation of the First International (1864): it was in that period that both
the doctrinal and the political criteria of seriousness were met. But, on the
one hand, this achievement only summed up the developments of the
centuries of nonage and, on the other hand, it formulated them in a particular
way that perhaps was practically, but certainly was not logically, the only
possible one. To some extent, therefore, the judgment passed by orthodox
socialism on the men of the nonage must be revised.
First of all, if the socialist schemes of those centuries were dreams, most
of them were rationalized dreams. And what individual thinkers more or less
perfectly succeeded in rationalizing were not simply their individual dreams
but the dreams of the non-ruling classes. Thus, those thinkers were not living
completely in the clouds; they also helped to bring to the surface what
slumbered below but was getting ready to wake up. In this respect even the
anarchists, back to their medieval predecessors who nourished in many a
convent and still more in the tertiary groups of the Franciscan Order, acquire
a significance which Marxists usually do not accord to them. However
contemptible their beliefs may seem to the orthodox socialist, much of the
propelling force of socialism comes, even today, from those irrational
longings of the hungry soul—not belly—which they voiced. 2
Second, the socialist thinkers of the nonage provided many a brick and
many a tool that proved useful later on. After all, the very idea of a socialist
society was their creation, and it was owing to their efforts that Marx and
his contemporaries were able to discuss it as a thing familiar to everyone.
But many of the utopians went much further than that. They worked out
details of the socialist plan or of certain variants of it, thereby formulating
problems—however inadequately—and clearing much ground. Even their
contribution to purely economic analysis cannot be neglected. It provided a
much-needed leaven in an otherwise distressingly stodgy pudding. Much of
it moreover was simply professional work that improved existing theory and,
among other things, stood Marx in good stead. The English socialists and
quasi-socialists who elaborated the labor theory of value—such men as
William Thompson—afford the best example of this.
Third, not all of those whom Marxists include among the utopians lacked
2 That is why the trained socialist’s endeavors to shake off what he himself admits to be
nonsensical or visionary in the creed of the untutored believer can never be wholly successful.
The popular appeal of socialism is due not to what can be rationally established about it, but
precisely to those mystic heresies which bourgeois and socialist economists unite in
condemning. In trying to distance himself, the socialist not only is being ungrateful to the
wave that carries him, but he is also courting the danger that its forces might be harnessed
into other service.
The Nonage 309
contact with mass movements. Some contact inevitably resulted from the fact
that the social and economic conditions which set in motion the intellectual’s
pen will also set in motion some group or class of the people—peasants or
artisans or agricultural laborers or simply the vagrants and the rabble. But
many of the utopians established much closer contact. The demands of the
peasants during the revolutions of the sixteenth century were already
formulated by intellectuals, and coordination and cooperation steadily became
closer as the centuries rolled on. “Gracchus” Babeuf, the leading spirit of the
only purely socialist movement within the French Revolution, was considered
of sufficient importance for the government to pay him the compliment of
executing him in 1797. Again England best illustrates this development. We
need only compare, from this angle, the history of the Leveller movement in
the seventeenth and the Chartist movement in the nineteenth centuries. In the
first case, Winstanley joined and led as an individual; in the second case,
groups of intellectuals reacted in a body and though their cooperation tapered
off into Christian Socialism, it was not merely an affair of the student’s closet
entirely divorced from a contemporaneous mass movement. In France, the best
example is afforded by Louis Blanc’s activities in 1848. In this as in other
respects, therefore, Utopian socialism differed from “scientific” socialism in
degree rather than in kind: the relation of the socialists of the nonage to class
movements was occasional and not as a rule a matter of fundamental principle,
whereas with Marx and with post-Marxian socialism it became precisely a
matter of fundamental principle and similar to the relation of a government
to its standing army.
A very important point—I hope it will not prove a stumbling block—
remains to be made. I have said that the doctrine which avers the presence
of a tendency toward socialism,3 and the permanent contact with an existing
or potential source of social power—the two requisites of socialism as a
serious political factor—were definitely established around the middle of the
nineteenth century in a way that was logically not the only possible one.
Marx and most of his contemporaries imparted a particular slant to their
doctrine by hold ing that the laboring class was the only one to be actively
associated with this tendency and that hence it was the only source of power
for the socialist to tap. For them, socialism meant primarily liberation of
labor from exploitation, and “the emancipation of the workers must be the
task of the working class itself.”
3 For the precise meaning of this phrase the reader should again turn to our discussions in
Parts I and II. Here it means two things: first, that real social forces, independent of
desirabilities or undesirabilities, are making for socialism which therefore will increasingly
acquire the character of a practical proposition; second, that this being so, there is present room
for party activities on socialist lines. The latter point will be discussed in ch. xxv.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties310
Now it is easy to understand why, as a practical proposition, the
conquest of the labor interest should have appealed to Marx more than any
other course, and why his doctrine should have been shaped accordingly.
But the idea has become so firmly rooted, also in some non-socialist minds,
as to blot out completely some facts which it takes a lot of trouble to
explain away, viz., that the labor movement, though often allied with
socialism, has remained distinct from it to this day, and that it proved by
no means so easy for socialists to establish in the workers’ world spheres
of influence in which their creed is accepted as a matter of course.
However we may interpret these facts, it should be clear that the labor
movement is not essentially socialist, just as socialism is not necessarily
laborite or proletarian. Nor is this surprising. For we have seen in Part II
that though the capitalist process slowly socializes economic life and much
besides, this spells transformation of the whole of the social organism all
parts of which are equally affected. The real income and the social weight
of the working class rise in this process, and capitalist society becomes
more and more incapable of dealing with labor difficulties. But this is a
poor substitute for the Marxian picture of labor being goaded into the
grand revolution by increasingly intolerable suffering. If we discard this
picture and realize that what actually increases is labor’s stake in the
capitalist system, we shall inevitably think less of the particular call
addressed to the working class by the logic of evolution. Still less
convincing is the role that Marxism assigns to the proletariat in the
catastrophe of the social drama. There is little for it to do if the
transformation is gradual. And if there be a grand revolution, the proletariat
will simply be talked and bullied into consent. The spearhead will be
formed by intellectuals assisted by the semicriminal rabble. And Marx’s
ideas on the subject are nothing but “ideology”—just as utopian as any
beliefs of the utopists.
Thus, while it remains substantially true that, unlike most of his
predecessors, Marx intended to rationalize an existing movement and not a
dream, and also that he and his successors actually gained partial control of
that movement, the difference is smaller than Marxists would have us
believe. There was, as we have seen, more of realism in the thought of the
utopists, and there was more of unrealistic dreaming in Marx’s thought than
they admit.
In the light of this fact, we shall think better of the socialists of the
nonage because they did not exclusively stress the proletarian aspect. In
particular their appeal to governments or to classes other than the
proletariat will appear to us less visionary and more realistic than it
appeared to Marx. For the state, its bureaucracy and the groups that man
The Nonage 311
the political engine are quite promising prospects for the socialist looking
for his source of social power. As should be evident by now, they are likely
to move in the desired direction with no less “dialectical” necessity than
are the masses. And that excrescence of the bourgeois stratum which we
shall term (a potiori) Fabian Socialism 4 is also suggestive. Marx’s choice
of social motive power thus produced a special case which, though
practically the most important, yet stands logically on a par with others that
are frauds and heresies to the orthodox.
4 See ch. xxvi. Marxists will naturally reply that those phenomena are mere derivates of
the genuine one, mere effects of the forward march of the proletariat. This is true if it means
that the latter is one of the factors in the situation which produced and is producing the former.
But taken in this sense, this proposition does not constitute an objection. If it means that there
is a one-way or purely cause-effect relation between proletarian and state socialism, then it does
constitute an objection but it is wrong. The socio-psychological process described in Part II will,
without any pressure from below, produce state and Fabian socialism which will even help to
produce that pressure. As we shall presently see, it is a fair question to ask where socialism
would be without the fellow traveler. It is certain that socialism (as distinguished from the labor
movement of the trade-union type) would be nowhere without the intellectual leader of
bourgeois extraction.

CHAPTER XXV
THE SITUATION THAT MARX FACED
1. According to Engels, Marx in 1847 adopted the term “communist” in
preference to the term “socialist,” because socialism had by that time
acquired a flavor of bourgeois respectability. However that may have been
and however we choose to explain this fact if it was a fact—more than once
we have seen good reason for interpreting socialism as a product of the
bourgeois mentality—there cannot be any doubt that Marx and Engels
themselves were typical bourgeois intellectuals. Exiles of bourgeois
extraction and tradition—this formula accounts for a lot both in Marx’s
thought and in the policies and political tactics he recommended. The
astounding thing is the extent to which his ideas prevailed.
First of all, the uprooted intellectual, with the formative experience of
1848 forever impressed upon his whole soul, cast off his own class and was
cast off by it. Similarly uprooted intellectuals and, at one remove, the
proletarian masses were henceforth all that was accessible to him and all he
had to put his trust in. This explains the doctrine which, as we have seen in
the preceding chapter, does stand in need of explanation, viz., that workers
would “emancipate themselves.”
Second, the same uprooted intellectual naturally became internationalist in
feeling. This meant more than that the problems and vicissitudes of any
particular country—even of individual national proletariats—did not primarily
concern him and always remained on the periphery of his interests. It meant
that it was so much easier for him to create the hypernational socialist religion
and to conceive of an international proletariat the component parts of which
were, in principle at least, much more closely wedded to each other than each
of them was to its own co-nationals of a different class. Anyone could in cold
logic have framed this obviously unrealistic conception and all that it implies
for the interpretation of past history and for the views of Marxist parties on
foreign policy. But then it would have had to contend with all the affective
influences exerted by the national environments and could never have been
passionately embraced by a man tied to a country by innumerable bonds. No
such bonds existed for Marx. Having no country himself he readily convinced
himself that the proletariat had none.
We shall presently see why—and how far—this teaching survived and
what, under varying circumstances, it was made to mean. Marx himself no
The Situation That Marx Faced 313
doubt accepted its non-interventionist and pacifist implications. He certainly
thought not only that “capitalist wars” were of no concern to the proletariat
but also that they were the means of subjugating it still more completely. The
concession he may be held to have made, i.e., that participation in the
defense of one’s own country against attack is not incompatible with the
duties of the faithful, obviously was no more than a very necessary tactical
device.
Third, whatever his doctrine may have been,1 the uprooted bourgeois had
democracy in his blood. That is to say, belief in that part of the bourgeois
scheme of values which centers in democracy was for him not alone a matter
of the rational perception of the conditions peculiar to the social pattern of his
or any other time. Nor was it merely a matter of tactics. It is true that socialist
activities (and his personal work) could not have been carried on, not with any
comfort at all events, in any environment professing other than democratic
principles as then understood. Save in very exceptional cases, every opposition
must stand for freedom—which for him meant democracy—and throw itself
on the mercy of “the people.” Of course this element was and in some
countries is even now very important. This is precisely, as I have pointed out,
why democratic professions by socialist parties do not mean much until their
political power becomes great enough to give them a choice of an alternative,
and why they do not, in particular, avail to establish any fundamental relation
between the logic of socialism and the logic of democracy. But it nevertheless
seems safe to say that for Marx democracy was above discussion and any other
political pattern below it. This much must be granted to the revolutionary of
the 1848 type. 2 Of course it was out of the question for him to accept so
important an article of the bourgeois faith as it stood. That would have
uncovered a most inconveniently large expanse of common ground. But we
have seen in the preceding part that he knew how to meet this difficulty by
boldly claiming that only socialist democracy was true democracy and that
bourgeois democracy was no democracy at all.
2. Such then was Marx’s political apriori. 3 No need to emphasize that it
was totally different from the aprioris of the average English socialist not
only of his own but of any time—so different as to render mutual sympathy
and even full mutual understanding almost impossible, quite irrespective of
Hegelianism and other doctrinal barriers. The same difference will stand out
1 See ch. xx and xxiii.
2 The emotional attitude acquired in 1848 also made it quite impossible for him to
understand, let alone to do justice to, the non-democratic regime that exiled him. Dispassionate
analysis could not have failed to reveal its achievements and possibilities. But such analysis
was in this case quite beyond his range.
3 No language that I know officially admits this word as a noun. To make it one is however
a very convenient solecism.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties314
still better if we compare Marx to another German intellectual of very similar
background, Ferdinand Lassalle (1825–1864). The scion of the same race,
the product of the same stratum, molded by a closely similar cultural
tradition, similarly conditioned by the experiences of 1848 and by the
ideology of bourgeois democracy, Lassalle yet differs from Marx in a manner
that cannot be explained wholly by the personal equation. Much more vital
than this was the fact that Marx was an exile and Lassalle was not. Lassalle
never cut himself off from his country or from classes other than the
proletariat. He never was an internationalist like Marx. By proletariat he
meant primarily the German proletariat. He had no objection to cooperation
with the state that was. He did not object to personal contact with Bismarck
or with the king of Bavaria. Such things are important, more important
perhaps than the most profound doctrinal differences, important enough to
produce different kinds of socialism and irreconcilable antagonisms.
Let us now take our stand on Marx’s apriori and survey the political data
that confronted him.
At first, the huge industrial masses of which Marx wrote and thought
existed nowhere except in England. Even there, the chartist movement having
petered out by the time he had found his bearings, the working class was
becoming increasingly realistic and conservative. Disappointed by the failure
of earlier radical activities, the men were turning away from flashy programs
and from songs about their right to the total product. They soberly embarked
upon an attempt to increase their share in it. The leaders were cautiously
trying to establish, to buttress and to increase the legal status and the
economic power of the trade unions within the political framework of
bourgeois society. On principle as well as for obvious tactical considerations,
they were bound to look upon revolutionary ideas or activities as a nuisance
and as a stupid or frivolous sabotage of labor’s serious business. Also, they
concerned themselves with the upper stratum of the working class; for the
lower, they harbored feelings that were akin to contempt.
In any case however, Marx and Engels, circumstanced as they were and
being the types they were, could never have thought of going forth in order
to organize the industrial proletariat, or any particular group of it, according
to ideas of their own. All they could hope for was contact with leaders and
with the union bureaucracy. Beholding, on the one hand, that attitude of the
“respectable” workman and, on the other hand, the attitude of the (then)
unorganizable mob of the big cities with which they hardly wished to act, 4
they faced a disagreeable dilemma. They could not fail to recognize the
importance of the trade-union movement that was about to accomplish, step
4 Marxians are, it should be remembered, quite prone to speak of a proletarian mob
(Lumpenprcletariat).
The Situation That Marx Faced 315
by step, the gigantic task of organizing the masses into something like an
articulate class, that is to say, to solve the problem which they themselves
felt to be the most important of all. But, being completely out of it and
realizing the danger that this class might acquire bourgeois standing and
adopt a bourgeois attitude, they were bound to dislike and to distrust the
trade unions as much as they were disliked and distrusted—as far as they
were noticed at all—by them. They were thus driven back upon the position
that has become characteristic of classical socialism and that, though much
reduced in importance, to this day expresses the fundamental antagonism
between the socialist intellectuals and labor (which may in important cases
be roughly equated to the antagonism between socialist parties and trade
unions). For them, the trade-union movement was something to be converted
to the doctrine of class war; as a means of such conversion, occasional
cooperation with it was proper for the faithful whenever labor troubles
radicalized the masses and sufficiently worried or excited trade-union
officials to induce them to listen to the gospel. But so long as conversion
was not complete and in particular so long as trade-union opinion remained
on principle averse to revolutionary or simply to political action, the
movement was not in a state of grace but on the contrary in error,
misconceiving its own true ends, deluding itself with trivialities that were
worse than futile; hence, except for the purpose of boring from within, the
faithful had to keep aloof.
This situation changed even during Marx’s and still more during Engels’
lifetime. The growth of the industrial proletariat that eventually made it a
power also on the Continent and the unemployment incident to the
depressions of that period increased their influence with labor leaders though
they never acquired any direct influence on the masses. To the end however
it was mainly the intellectuals that supplied them the material to work with.
But though their success in that quarter was considerable, the intellectuals
gave them still more trouble than did the indifference, occasionally
amounting to hostility, of the labor men. There was a fringe of socialist
intellectuals that had no objection to identifying themselves either with the
trade unions or with social reform of the bourgeois-radical or even the
conservative type. And these of course dispensed a very different socialism
which, holding out the promise of immediate benefit, was a dangerous
competitor. There were moreover intellectuals, foremost among them
Lassalle, who had conquered positions among the masses that were still more
directly competitive. And finally there were intellectuals who went far
enough as regards revolutionary ardor, but whom Marx and Engels quite
rightly looked upon as the worst enemies of serious socialism—the
“putschists” like Blanqui, the dreamers, the anarchists and so on. Doctrinal
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties316
as well as tactical considerations rendered it imperative to meet all of these
groups with an unflinching No.
3. That doctrinal background and that tactical situation made it extremely
difficult for Marx to find answers for two vital questions which every
follower or would-be follower was sure to ask: the question of the attitude
toward the policies of the bourgeois parties and the question of the
immediate program.
As regards the first, socialist parties could not be advised to watch
bourgeois politics in silence. Their obvious task was to criticize capitalist
society, to expose the masquerade of class interests, to point out how much
better everything would be in the socialist paradise and to beat up for
recruits: to criticize and to organize. However, a wholly negative attitude,
though quite satisfactory as a principle, would have been impossible for any
party of more than negligible political importance to keep up. It would
inevitably have collided with most of the real desiderata of organized labor
and, if persisted in for any length of time, would have reduced the followers
to a small group of political ascetics. Considering the influence that Marx’s
teaching exerted, right up to 1914, on the great German party and on many
smaller groups it is interesting to see how he dealt with this difficulty.
So far as he felt it possible to do so, he took the only position that was
logically unimpeachable. Socialists must refuse to participate in the sham
improvements by which the bourgeoisie tried to deceive the proletariat. Such
participation—later dubbed Reformism—spelled lapse from the Faith, betrayal
of the true aims, an insidious attempt to patch up what should be destroyed.
Disciples like Bebel who made the pilgrimage to the shrine after having thus
strayed from the right path were soundly rated. It is true that Marx and Engels
themselves had at the time of their communist party of 1847 contemplated
cooperation with left-wing bourgeois groups. Also, the Communist Manifesto
recognized the necessity of occasional compromises and alliances, just as it
allowed that tactics would have to differ according to the circumstances of time
and place. So much was implied in the maxim enjoined upon the faithful to
make use of all the antagonisms between the bourgeoisies of different countries
and between bourgeois groups within every country—for this can hardly be
done without a measure of cooperation with some of them. But all that only
amounted to qualifying a principle in order to uphold it the more effectively.
In each case, the exception had to be severely scrutinized, the presumption
being always against it. Moreover, it was cooperation in certain definite
emergencies, preferably revolutions, that was envisaged rather than more
durable alliance involving understandings in the ordinary run of political life
which might endanger the purity of the creed.
How Marxists should behave when confronted by a particular policy of
The Situation That Marx Faced 317
the bourgeois enemy that clearly benefits the proletariat, we may infer from
the example set by the master himself in a very important instance. Free trade
was one of the main planks in the platform of English liberalism. Marx was
far too good an economist not to see what boon, in the circumstances of that
time, it conferred upon the working class. The boon might be belittled, the
motives of bourgeois free traders might be reviled. But that did not solve the
problem, for surely socialists would have to support free trade, particularly
in foodstuffs. Well, so they should but not of course because cheap bread
was a boon—oh, no!—but because free trade would quicken the pace of
social evolution, hence the advent of the social revolution. The tactical trick
is admirable. The argument is moreover quite true and admits of application
to a great many cases. The oracle did not say however what socialists should
do about policies which, while also benefiting the proletariat, do not promote
capitalist evolution—such as most measures of social betterment, social
insurance and the like—or which, while promoting capitalist evolution, do
not directly benefit the proletariat. But if the bourgeois camp should split
upon such questions the road was clear by virtue of the precept to make use
of capitalist dissensions. From this angle Marx would also have dealt with
reforms sponsored, in opposition to the bourgeoisie by extra-bourgeois
elements such as the landed aristocracy and gentry although, in his schema
of things, there was no separate place for this phenomenon.
The second question was no less thorny. No party can live without a
program that holds out the promise of immediate benefits. But in strict logic
Marxism had no such program to offer. Anything positive done or to be done
in the vitiated atmosphere of capitalism was ipso facto tainted. Marx and
Engels were in fact worrying about this and always discouraged programs
that involved constructive policy within the capitalist order and inevitably
savored of bourgeois radicalism. However, when they themselves faced the
problem in 1847, they resolutely cut the Gordian knot. The Communist
Manifesto quite illogically lists a number of immediate objects of socialist
policy, simply laying the socialist barge alongside the liberal liner.
Free education, universal suffrage, suppression of child labor, a
progressive income tax, nationalization of land, banking and transportation,
expansion of state enterprise, reclamation of waste lands, compulsory
industrial service for all, the spreading out of industrial centers over the
country—all this clearly measures the extent to which (at that time) Marx
and Engels allowed themselves to be opportunist though they were inclined
to deny the privilege to other socialists. For the striking thing about this
program is the absence of any plank that we should recognize as typically
or exclusively socialist if we met it in another entourage; any single one of
them could figure in a non-socialist program—even the nationalization of

land has been advocated, on special grounds, by otherwise bourgeois
writers—and most of them are simply taken from the radical stockpot. This
was of course the only sensible thing to do. But all the same it was a mere
makeshift, obviously intended to serve no other purpose than that of covering
an embarrassing practical weakness. Had Marx been interested in those items
for their own sake, he would have had no alternative but to coalesce with
the radical wing of bourgeois liberalism. As it was, they mattered little to
him and he felt no obligation to make any sacrifice for their sake; had the
bourgeois radicals carried them all, this would presumably have come to
Marx as a very disagreeable surprise.
4. The same principles, the same tactics and similar political data
produced the Inaugural Address to the International Workmen’s Association
(the “First International”) in 1864. The foundation of the latter meant indeed
a great stride beyond the German Arbeiterbildungsverein of 1847 or the little
international group of the same year. It was of course no organization of
socialist parties—though for instance the two German ones joined, the
Lassallean Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein speedily resigned—and still
less an international organization of the proletariat. But labor groups from
many lands and of many types were actually represented and even English
trade unions showed interest enough to bear for a time, in a rather
noncommittal way and with an eye to possible immediate advantages, with
a somewhat uncongenial alliance. George Odger figured among the
founders. 5 The large claims made by the Association and some of its
historians concerning its role in the revolutionary movements and the major
labor troubles of the time will bear discounting. But if it effected little and
never led or controlled, it at least offered unifying phraseology. And it
established contacts that in the end might have raised it, with the kind
assistance of its bourgeois enemies who were foolish enough to advertise for
it, to a position of real importance. In the beginning all went fairly well and
the first four “congresses” were distinctly successful, certain unsocialist
incidents, such as the vote upholding the principle of inheritance, being
tactfully overlooked by the orthodox members. Bakunin’s invasion (1869)
and expulsion (1872) however dealt a blow from which the Association
proved unable to recover though it lingered on till 1874.
Marx was from the first aware of the possibilities and of the dangers
inherent in that caravanserai which held intellectuals of doubtful standing
alongside of labor men obviously determined to use the Association or to
5 He even acted as president of the International’s council. That meant a lot, since he had
been one of the most prominent promoters of federation and amalgamation among trade unions,
an organizer of the London Trade Council and a leading officer of the reform league for the
enfranchisement of urban workers.
The Situation That Marx Faced 319
disown it according to circumstances. They were the possibilities for
which, and the dangers against which, he had always fought. The first task
was to keep the organization together, the second to impart to it the
Marxian slant, both to be solved in the face of the facts, that his personal
followers were always a minority and that his influence on the other
members was much smaller than might be inferred from his being
drafted—or rather allowed—to make the program address. In consequence,
this address contained concessions to un Marxian views similar to those
which Marx himself was shocked to find in the Gotha program of the
German Social Democratic party (1875). Similarly, judicious maneuvering
and compromise were much in evidence ever after—the sort of thing that
once made Marx exclaim in semi-humorous despair: “Je ne suis pas
Marxiste.” But the meaning of compromise depends upon the man by
whom, and the spirit in which, it is made. He who cares only for the trend
may put up with many deviations. Evidently Marx trusted himelf to keep
his trend steadily in view and to find his way back to it after each
deviation. But we shall understand that he felt misgivings when he saw
others playing the same game. There was thus more than mere egotism
both in his tactical shuffling and in his venomous denunciations of other
people’s shuffling.
Of course both the tactics and the principle of what has ever since
remained the classical policy of orthodox socialism are open to criticism. The
tactical example set by Marx left followers free to justify practically any
course of action or inaction by some move or dictum of the master. The
principle has been denounced for pointing a way that led nowhere. All the
more important is it to realize its rationale. Marx believed in the proletarian
revolution. He also believed—though his own doctrine should have made
him doubt this—that the right moment for it was not far off, just as most
early Christians believed that the day of judgment was at hand. Therefore,
his political method was indeed founded upon an error of diagnosis. Those
intellectuals who extol his political acumen 6 fail entirely to see the amount
of wishful thinking that entered into his practical judgment. But the facts
within his horizon and his inferences from them being taken for granted, that
method does follow as do his views on the subject of immediate results and
on the table fellowship with bourgeois reformers. To found a homogeneous
party based upon the organized proletariat of all countries that would march
toward the goal without losing its revolutionary faith and getting its powder
wet on the road was from that standpoint indeed the task of paramount
importance compared with which everything else was nugatory.

CHAPTER XXVI
FROM 1875 TO 1914
I. E NGLISH D EVELOPMENTS A ND T HE S PIRIT O F F ABIANISM
T HERE is some symbolic significance in these two dates. The year 1875
saw the birth of the first purely socialist party that was powerful
enough to count as a factor in politics. This momentous event came to pass
through the merger of the two German groups—Lassalle’s group and
another founded by Bebel and Liebknecht in 1869—into the Social
Democratic Party which, though at the time (Gotha program) it made
considerable concessions to Lassalle’s creed, 1 eventually embraced
Marxism (Erfurt program, 1891) and steadily fought its way to the proud
position it held in 1914 when, like all socialist parties, it met the crisis of
its fate. 2 Before commenting on the astounding development that brought
a Marxist party, without any compromise involving sacrifice of principle,
within sight of parliamentary leadership, we shall glance at the course of
events in other countries and first at the English socialism of that period
which on the surface offers so striking and instructive a contrast to it.
Below the surface, there are of course substantially similar social
processes and, as parts of them, substantially similar labor movements.
The differences between the English and the German cases as to tone,
ideology and tactics are easily explained. Ever since the Owenite Grand
National Consolidated Trade Union had broken down in 1834 or since
chartism had ebbed away, the English labor movement had ceased to
elicit any determined hostility. Some of its economic aims were espoused
by the liberal and others by the conservative party. 3 The trade union acts
of 1871, 1875 and 1876, for instance, were passed without anything that
could have stung labor into militancy. Moreover, the battle for
1 Lassalle’s main nostrum was organization of the workmen into state-aided producers’
cooperatives that were to compete with, and in the end to eliminate, private industry. This so
obviously smacks of utopianism that it is not difficult to understand Marx’s aversion.
2 It then held no out of 397 seats in the Reichstag and, owing to the inability of the bourgeois
groups to organize great homogeneous parties, this meant even more than the figure in itself
suggests.
3 The emergence of a pro-labor attitude in the conservative camp is particularly striking.
On the one hand the group led by Lord Ashley, and on the other hand the Young England group
(Disraeli’s Tory Democracy) may be mentioned by way of illustration.
From 1875 to 1914 321
enfranchisement was fought out by non-socialist groups, the masses not
having to do much except cheering and booing. In all this, the superior
quality of the rank and file of English labor stands out well. So does the
superior quality of English political society; after having proved itself
able to avoid an analogon to the French Revolution and to eliminate the
dangers threatening from dear bread, it then continued to know how to
manage social situations of increasing difficulty and how to surrender
with some grace—witness the Trades Disputes Act of 1906. 4 In
consequence, the English proletariat took longer in becoming “class-
conscious” or in getting to the landmark at which Keir Hardie was able
to organize the Independent Labour Party (1893). But the rise of the New
Unionism 5 eventually heralded a state of things that, barring
verbalization, did not differ essentially from the German one.
The nature and extent of such difference as there was will stand out most
clearly if for a moment we look at the group whose aims and methods
express it to perfection, the Fabian Society. Marxists will smile
contemptuously at what to them must seem to be a gross exaggeration of the
importance of a small group of intellectuals which never wished to be
anything else. In reality, the Fabians in England, or the attitudes they
embodied, were just as important as were the Marxists in Germany.
The Fabians emerged in 1883, and remained for the whole of our period
4 It is difficult, at the present time, to realize how this measure must have struck people
who still believed in a state and in a legal system that centered in the institution of private
property. For in relaxing the law of conspiracy in respect to peaceful picketing—which
practically amounted to legalization of trade-union action implying the threat of force—
and in exempting trade-union funds from liability in actions for damages for torts—which
practically amounted to enacting that trade unions could do no wrong—this measure in fact
resigned to the trade unions part of the authority of the state and granted to them a position
of privilege which the formal extension of the exemption to employers’ unions was
powerless to affect. Yet the bill was the result of the report of a Royal Commission set up
in 1903 when the conservative party was in power. And the conservative leader (Balfour),
in a speech on the third reading, accepted it without displaying any discomfort. The
political situation in 1906 no doubt goes far to explain this attitude. But this does not
invalidate my point.
5 The New Unionism means the spread of regular and stable organizations which to the
middle of the nineties were substantially confined to the skilled trades and had developed
attitudes of professional pride and bourgeois respectability (some leaders of the eighties,
like Crawford, frequently emphasized the gulf that separated the respectable people in the
trade unions from the proletarian mass) to the more or less unskilled strata below them.
These felt much less sure of their bargaining power and were hence more amenable to
socialist propaganda and to the argument that strikes alone were unsafe weapons and that
they should be supplemented by political action. There is thus an important link between
that downward spread of unionism and the change in the trade unions’ attitude toward
political activity on the one hand and toward socialism on the other. It was then—a few
years after the great dock strike of 1889—that trade-union congresses began to pass
socialist resolutions.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties322
a small group of bourgeois intellectuals. 6 They hailed from Bentham and Mill
and carried on their tradition. They entertained the same generous hopes for
humanity as the philosophical radicals had before them. They went forth to
work for rational reconstruction and improvement in the same spirit of
practical progressivism.
They were careful about their facts which some of them took no end of
trouble to collect by means of extensive research, and critical of arguments
and measures. But they were quite uncritical as to the fundamentals, cultural
and economic, of their aims. These they took for granted which is only
another way of saying that, like good Englishmen, they took themselves for
granted. They were unable to see the difference between a slum and the
House of Lords. Why both of these were obviously “bad things,” that’s
common sense, is it not? And greater economic equality or self-government
in India or trade unions or free trade were no less obviously “good things,”
who could doubt it? All the thinking that was necessary was on how to clean
up the bad things and on how to secure the good things; everything else was
irritating futility. Single-minded devotion to public service was as much in
evidence in all this as was intolerance of other views about individual and
national values—in its way quite as pronounced as was that of the
Marxists—and an element of petty-bourgeois resentment against everything
aristocratic, including beauty.
At first there was nothing behind the Fabians. They set out to persuade
whoever would, listen. They lectured to working-class and to bourgeois crowds.
They pamphleteered ably and extensively. They recommended or fought
particular policies, plans and bills. The most important of all their avenues to
influence however was their contact with individual “keymen,” or rather with
individuals in the entourage of political, industrial and labor leaders. Their
country and their own social and political location in their country offered a
unique opportunity for establishing and exploiting such contacts.
English political society does not always accept outsiders’ advice but,
much more than any other society, it is ready to listen to it. And some of
the Fabians were not simply outsiders. A few were able to avail themselves
of connections formed in Oxford and Cambridge students’ unions and
common rooms. They were not living, morally speaking, on another planet.
Most of them were not straight enemies of the established order. All of them
stressed willingness to cooperate much more than hostility. They were not
out to found a party and greatly disliked the phraseology of class war and
6 The group, which never numbered more than from 3000 to 4000 members, was really still
smaller than its membership indicates. For the operative nucleus amounted to no more than 10
or 20 per cent of it. This nucleus was bourgeois in background and tradition and also in another
respect: most of its members were economically independent at least in the sense that they had
a bare competence to live on.
From 1875 to 1914 323
revolution. Whenever possible they preferred making themselves useful to
making themselves a nuisance. And they had something to offer to the
parliamentarian or administrator who often welcomed suggestions as to what
should be done and how to do it.
A modern cabinet minister can in general find within the walls of his
ministry most of the information and suggestions he needs. In particular, he
can never suffer from lack of statistics. That was not so in the eighties and
nineties. With rare exceptions, civil servants of all ranks knew their routine
and little else. Outside of the lines of established policies the parliamentarian
in office, still more the parliamentarian out of office, was often hard up for
facts and ideas especially in the field of the “new” social problems. A group
that had them in stock and was always willing to serve them up, neatly
arranged and ready for use from the treasury or any other bench, was sure
to have entrée, especially by the backdoor. The civil service accepted this.
And not only that: being to a considerable extent in sympathy with at least
the immediate aims of the Fabians, it allowed itself to be educated by them.
The Fabians in turn also accepted this role of unofficial public servants. In
fact, it suited them perfectly. They were not personally ambitious. They liked
to serve behind the scene. Action through the bureaucracy whose growth in
numbers and in power they foresaw and approved fitted in very well with
the general scheme of their democratic state socialism.
But how—so Marx would have asked and so the little group of English
Marxists (Hyndman’s Democratic Federation, born in 1881) actually did
ask—could that kind of achievement ever amount to anything if, indeed,
it did not amount to conspiracy with the political exponents of the
bourgeois interests? How could it be called socialist at all and, if so, was
this not another edition of Utopian socialism (in the Marxist sense defined
above)? It is easy to visualize how perfectly nauseating Fabians and
Marxists must have been to each other and how heartily they must have
despised each other’s illusions, though it was the practice of the Fabians
to avoid the discussions of fundamental principles and tactics in which
Marxists delighted and to bear with the latter in an attitude of slightly
patronizing sympathy. Yet for the detached observer there is no difficulty
in answering these questions.
Socialist endeavor of the Fabian type would not have amounted to anything
at any other time. But it did amount to much during the three decades
preceding 1914, because things and souls were ready for that kind of message
and neither for a less nor for a more radical one. Formulation and organization
of existing opinion were all that was needed in order to turn possibilities into
articulate policy, and this “organizing formulation” the Fabians provided in a
most work-manlike manner. They were reformers. The spirit of the times made
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties324
socialists of them. They were genuine socialists because they aimed at helping
in a fundamental reconstruction of society which in the end was to make
economic care a public affair. They were voluntarist socialists and therefore
they would at any earlier stage have come within the Marxian concept of
utopists. But as it was, they had their bearings waiting for them so that the
implications of that concept did not fit their case. From their standpoint it
would have been nothing short of madness to rouse the bourgeois quarry into
awareness of danger by talking about revolutions and class wars. The
awakening of class consciousness was precisely what they wanted to avoid,
at least at first, since it would have rendered impossible the peaceful but
effective spread of their principles throughout the political and administrative
organs of bourgeois society. When things had sufficiently matured, they did
not hesitate to help the Independent Labour party into existence, to cooperate
with (and on) the Labour Representation Committee of 1900, to start the trade
unions on their political career, to shape the course of the Progressive party
in the London County Council, to preach first municipal and then general
socialism—and, eventually, the virtues of the soviet system.
No doubt there is a side to all this which it would be easy to make
the subject of adverse comment. But, after all, if they never issued a
resounding declaration of war more Marxiano and never told the quarry
exactly what they were going to do to it, they also never undertook to
protect it. Another criticism that might be leveled against the Fabians
from the opposite standpoint, viz., that their modus procedendi courted
the danger of getting stuck in the outlying defenses of the capitalist
system and that it might never lead to the grand pitched battle, fails to
take account of their peculiar attitude. On their behalf it can be replied
that if, par l’impossible, their attack on the capitalist system succeeded
in reforming it sufficiently without killing it, why, that would only be
a matter for congratulation. And as to the pitched battle, they answered
their revolutionary critics in advance by adopting, with singular felicity,
the name of the Roman general who, for all his circumspection, did
more than any of his impetuous predecessors had done toward driving
Hannibal from Italy.
Thus, though it might be said with truth that, in the matter of class war
as in others, Fabianism is the very opposite of Marxism, it might also be held
that the Fabians were in a sense better Marxists than Marx was himself. To
concentrate on the problems that are within practical politics, to move in step
with the evolution of things social, and to let the ultimate goal take care of
itself is really more in accord with Marx’s fundamental doctrine than the
revolutionary ideology he himself grafted upon it. To have no illusions about
an imminent catastrophe of capitalism, to realize that socialization is a slow

process which tends to transform the attitudes of all classes of society, even
spells superiority in fundamental doctrine.

Every country has its own socialism. But things did not differ greatly from
the English paradigma in those continental countries whose contributions to
humanity’s fund of cultural values is so strikingly out of proportion to their
size—the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries in particular. Take
Sweden for an instance. Like her art, her science, her politics, her social
institutions and much besides, her socialism and her socialists owe their
distinction not to any peculiar features of principle or intention, but to the
stuff the Swedish nation is made of and to its exceptionally well-balanced
social structure. That is why it is so absurd for other nations to try to copy
Swedish examples; the only effective way of doing so would be to import
the Swedes and to put them in charge.
The Swedes being the people they are and their social structure being
what it is, we shall have no difficulty in understanding the two outstanding
characteristics of their socialism. The socialist party, almost always ably
and conscientiously led, grew slowly in response to a very normal social
process, without any attempt to push ahead of normal development and to
antagonize for the sake of antagonizing. Hence its rise to political power
produced no convulsions. Responsible office came naturally to its leaders
who were able to meet the leaders of other parties on terms of equality and
largely on common ground: to this day, though a communist group has of
course developed, the differences in current politics reduce to such
questions as whether a few million kroner more or less should be spent on
some social purpose accepted by all. And within the party, the antagonism
between intellectuals and labor men only shows under the microscope
precisely because, owing to the level of both, there is no great cultural gulf
between them and because, the Swedish social organism producing a
relatively smaller supply of unemployable intellectuals than do other social
organisms, exasperated and exasperating intellectuals are not as numerous
as they are elsewhere. This is sometimes described as the “enervating
control” exerted by trade unions over the socialist movement in general and
over the party in particular. To observers steeped in the phraseology of
current radicalism, this may well seem so. But this diagnosis entirely fails
to do justice to the social and racial environment of which not only the
labor men but also the intellectuals are the products and which prevents
both of them from exalting their socialism into a religion. Though room
might be found in Marx’s teaching for such patterns, the average Marxist
cannot of course be expected to look with favor upon a socialist party of
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties326
the Swedish type, or even to admit that it embodies a genuine case of
socialist endeavor. Swedish socialists in turn were very lightly tinged with
Marxism though they frequently used language that conformed to what was
then considered socialist etiquette, especially in their international relations
with other socialist groups.
On the other end of the scale, in Russia, we find a socialism that was
almost purely Marxist and hence enjoyed that favor to the full, but is no less
easy to understand from its environment. Tsarist Russia was an agrarian
country of largely pre-capitalist complexion. The industrial proletariat, so far
as it was accessible to the professional socialist, formed but a small part of
the total population of about 150 millions. 7 The commercial and industrial
bourgeoisie, correspondingly weak in numbers, was not much more efficient
than was anyone else, though capitalist evolution fostered by the government
was rapidly gathering momentum. Inserted into this structure was an
intelligentsia whose ideas were as foreign to the soil as were the Paris dresses
of Russian society women.
To many of the intellectuals, the form of government then prevailing—
an absolute monarch (autocrator) heading a huge bureaucracy and allied with
the landed aristocracy and the church—was of course abomination. And
public opinion all over the world has accepted their reading of history. Even
writers most hostile to the regime that followed upon that of the tsars
invariably make haste to assure their readers that they are duly horrified at
the monstrosity of tsarism. Thus the simple truth has been entirely lost in a
maze of cant phrases. As a matter of fact, that form of government was no
less appropriate to the social pattern that had produced it than was the
parliamentary monarchy in England and the democratic republic in the
United States. The performance of the bureaucracy, considering the
conditions under which it had to work, was far above what the world has
been made to believe; its social reforms, agrarian and other, and its halting
steps toward a diluted type of constitutionalism were all that could have been
expected in the circumstances. It was the imported radicalism and the group
interest of the intellectuals that clashed with the spirit of the nation and not
the tsarist monarchy which on the contrary had a strong hold upon the vast
majority of all classes.
From this, two conclusions follow which at first sight seem paradoxical
though no serious student of history will consider them so. On the one hand,
any big or sudden move in the direction desired by those liberal lawyers, doctors,
professors and civil servants that formed the Kadet party (the party of the
Constitutional Democrats) was impossible not so much because their program
7 In 1905 factory employment amounted to about one million and a half.
From 1875 to 1914 327
was inacceptable to the monarchy as because they were so weak. Admitting them
to power would have meant admitting an element that commanded not more but
less support among the masses and was not more but less in sympathy with their
feelings and interests than were the groups that ran tsarism. There was no scope
for a bourgeois regime let alone a socialist one. And there was no analogy
between the French situation of 1789 and the Russian situation of 1905. The
social structure that crumbled in 1789 was obsolete, stood in the way of almost
everything that had any vitality in the nation, and was unable to cope with the
fiscal, economic and social problems of the hour. This was not so in the Russia
of 1905. There had been loss of prestige owing to the defeat suffered at the hands
of Japan and there were disaffection and disorder in consequence. But the state
proved itself equal to the tasks not only of suppressing the disorder but also of
attacking the problems behind it. In France the result was Robespierre, in Russia
it was Stolypin. This would not have been possible if the life had gone out of
tsarism as it had gone out of the French ancien régime. There is no reason for
assuming that, but for the strain the World War put upon the social fabric, the
Russian monarchy would have failed to transform itself peacefully and
successfully under the influence of, and in step with, the economic development
of the country.8
8 This analysis, of course, raises questions of great interest concerning the nature of what
we are in the habit of calling historical necessity on the one hand and of the role in the historical
process of the quality of individual leadership on the other. It would, I think, be difficult to
hold that Russia was driven into the war by inexorable necessity. The interests at stake in the
Serbian quarrel were not of vital importance, to say the least. The domestic situation in 1914
was not such as to enforce a policy of military aggression as a last resort. The former no doubt
actuated nationalists, the latter some (not all) of the extreme reactionaries, and both a number
of individuals and groups with axes to grind. But a modicum of common prudence and firmness
in the last of the tsars could no doubt have averted participation in the war. It would have been
more difficult, but it cannot be called impossible, to avert catastrophe later on when the situation
had declared itself and when, after the battle of Gorlice, all hope for military success had gone.
Even after the downfall of the monarchy, it is by no means certain that the Kerensky government
could not have saved the situation by carefully husbanding its resources and refusing to yield
to the importunity of the Allies instead of ordering that desperate last attack. But tsarist society
before the bourgeois revolt, and bourgeois society after it, watched the approaching doom in a
state of paralysis that was as unmistakable as it is difficult to explain. Now the presence of
groupwise incompetence in the one camp and of ability and energy in the other cannot of course
be attributed to chance. But in this case, the incompetence of the old regime merely amounted
to its being not equal to a situation of complete disorganization and this situation could
doubtless have been avoided.
The reader will hardly expect to find that my analysis of Russian socialism and its
environmental conditions agrees with Trotsky’s (History of the Russian Revolution, English
translation by M.Eastman, 1934). All the more significant is the fact that the two do not differ
toto coelo and that, in particular, Trotsky considered the question what would have happened
if the revolutionary movement had impinged upon a “different tsar.” It is true that he dismisses
the obvious inference from considerations of that order. But he recognizes that the Marxist
doctrine does not constrain us to neglect the element of personality, though he does not seem
to admit the full importance of it for a diagnosis of the Russian revolution.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties328
On the other hand, it was precisely because of the fundamental stability
of the social structure that the intellectuals, who could not hope to prevail
by anything like normal methods, were driven into a desperate radicalism
and into courses of criminal violence. Theirs was the kind of radicalism
whose intensity is in inverse proportion to its practical possibilities, the
radicalism of impotence. Assassinations might be futile and productive of
nothing but repression but there was not much else to do. The brutality of
the methods of repression in turn produced retaliation and thus that tragedy
unfolded, the tragedy of cruelty and crime incessantly reinforcing each
other, which is all that the world saw and felt and which it diagnosed as
we should expect.
Now Marx was no putschist. For some of the antics of Russian
revolutionaries, especially for those of the Bakunin type, he harbored as
much hatred as is compatible with contempt. Moreover, he should have
seen—perhaps he did see—that the social and economic structure of
Russia failed to fulfill every one of the conditions which according to his
own doctrine are essential for the success and even for the emergence of
his type of socialism. But if, on logical grounds, this should have
prevented the Russian intellectuals from embracing his teaching, we shall
understand readily why, on the contrary, it was a tremendous success with
them. They were—more or less seriously—revolutionaries and they were
at loose ends. Here was a revolutionary gospel of unsurpassable force.
Marx’s glowing phrases and chiliastic prophecy were exactly what they
needed in order to get out of the dreary desert of nihilism. Moreover, this
compound of economic theory, philosophy and history suited the Russian
taste to perfection. Never mind that the gospel was quite inapplicable to
their case and really held out no promise to them. The believer always
hears what he wants to hear, no matter what the prophet actually says.
The further removed the actual situation was from the state of maturity
which Marx visualized, the more ready were the Russian intellectuals—
not only the professed socialists among them—to look to him for a
solution of their problems.
Thus, a Marxist group emerged as early as 1883, to evolve into the
Social Democratic party in 1898. Leadership and, at the beginning,
membership were primarily intellectual of course, though sufficient
success attended the underground organizing activity among the “masses”
to enable sympathetic observers to speak of a fusion of labor groups
under Marxist leadership. This accounts for the absence of many of the
difficulties met by other Marxist groups in countries with strong labor
unions. In any case at first, the workmen who entered the organization
accepted the intellectuals’ leadership with the utmost docility and hardly
From 1875 to 1914 329
even pretended to decide anything for themselves. In consequence,
developments in doctrine and in action were on strictly Marxian lines and
on a high level. Naturally this drew the blessings of the German
defenders of the faith who, beholding such disarming virtue, evidently
felt that there must be some exceptions to the Marxian thesis that serious
socialism can spring only from full-fledged capitalism. Plekhanov,
however, the founder of the group of 1883 and the leading figure of the
first two decades, whose able and learned contributions to Marxist
doctrine commanded universal respect, really accepted this thesis and
therefore cannot have hoped for the early realization of socialism. While
valiantly fighting the good fight against reformism and all the other
contemporaneous heresies that threatened the purity of the faith, and
while upholding belief in the revolutionary goal and method, this true
Marxist must have felt early misgivings at the rise, within the party, of a
group that seemed bent on action in the immediate future, though he
sympathized with it and with its leader, Lenin.
The inevitable conflict that split the party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks
(1903) meant something much more serious than a mere disagreement
regarding tactics such as the names of the two groups suggest. At the time
no observer, however experienced, could have realized fully the nature of the
rift. By now the diagnosis should be obvious. The Marxist phraseology
which both groups retained obscured the fact that one of them had
irrevocably broken away from classical Marxism.
Lenin had evidently no illusions concerning the Russian situation. He saw
that the tsarist regime could be successfully attacked only when temporarily
weakened by military defeat and that in the ensuing disorganization a resolute
and well-disciplined group could by ruthless terror overthrow whatever other
regime might attempt to replace it. For this contingency, the likelihood of
which he seems to have realized more clearly than did anyone else, he was
resolved to prepare the appropriate instrument. He had little use for the semi-
bourgeois ideology about the peasants—who of course in Russia constituted
the relevant social problem—and still less for theories about the necessity of
waiting for the workmen to rise of their own initiative in order to accomplish
the grand revolution. What he needed was a well-trained bodyguard of
revolutionist janissaries, deaf to any argument but his own, free from all
inhibitions, impervious to the voices of reason or humanity. Under the
circumstances and in the requisite quality such a troop could be recruited only
from the intellectual stratum, and the best material available was to be found
within the party. His attempt to gain control of the latter therefore amounted
to an attempt to destroy its very soul. The majority and their leader, L.Martov,
must have felt that. He did not criticize Marx or advocate any new departure.

He resisted Lenin in the name of Marx and stood for the Marxist doctrine of
a proletarian mass party. The novel note was struck by Lenin.
Since time immemorial, heretics have invariably claimed that they
were not out to destroy whatever gospel they found in possession but,
on the contrary, that they were trying to restore its pristine purity.
Lenin, adopting the time-honored practice, exalted and out-Marxed
Marx instead of renouncing allegiance. At the most, he gave the lead
implied in the phrase that became so popular with Trotsky and Stalin,
“Marxism in the epoch of imperialism.” And the reader will readily see
that, up to a certain crucial range, it was not difficult for Lenin to adopt
both form and matter of unadulterated Marxism. Yet it is no less easy
to see that from this stronghold he sallied forth to occupy an essentially
un-Marxian position. Un-Marxian was not merely the idea of
socialization by pronunciamiento in an obviously immature situation;
much more so was the idea that “emancipation” was to be not, as the
Marxist dogma has it, the work of the proletariat itself but of a band
of intellectuals officering the rabble. 9 This meant more than a different
view about agitatorial practice and compromises, more than a
disagreement on secondary points of Marxist doctrine. This meant
divorce from its innermost meaning. 10
9 As a matter of fact, contact with criminal elements was formed, though not by Lenin
himself but by (he lieutenants on the spot. This led to the activity of the “ex’s” (shock groups
engaged in practical “expropriations,” i.e., holdups) both in Russia proper and in Poland. This
was pure gangsterdom though western intellectuals swallowed an apologetic “theory” of it.
10 For our purpose it is not necessary to comment further on the details of a well-known
story. The following remarks will suffice. Lenin did not succeed in subjugating the Russian
socialist party whose leaders on the contrary drew away from him as time went on the difficulty
of their situation, arising from their wish to keep up something like a united front without
jettisoning their principles, is well illustrated by Plekhanov’s vacillations. But Lenin did succeed
in keeping his group together, in curbing it into obedience and in adjusting its course to the
problems raised by the revolt of 1905 and its aftermath, including the presence of a Leninist
element in the Duma. At the same time, he succeeded in keeping contact with, and standing
in, the Second International (see below) of which he attended three congresses and in whose
bureau he for a time represented the Russian party. This would hardly have been possible if
his views and activities had been allowed to impress the representatives of the other nations as
they impressed the majority of Russian socialists. As it was, that body, and western socialist
opinion in general, looked upon him simply as the outstanding figure in the left wing of
orthodoxy and bore with him and his unbending extremism, admiring him in some respects and
not taking him too seriously in others. Thus in his sphere of politics he played a double role
that was not without analogy with the double role of the tsarist regime whose international
attitudes (as exemplified by its sponsoring international arbitration and security) also differed
considerably from its attitudes at home.
Neither these achievements nor his contributions to socialist thought—most of them
distinctly mediocre (as, by the way, were those of Trotsky)—would have secured him a place
in the front rank of socialists. Greatness came after Russia s breakdown in the World War and
was as much the result of a unique combination of circumstances that made his weapons

In the United States a totally different social pattern proved as
unfavorable as was the Russian to the growth of a genuinely socialist
mass movement. Thus the two cases present similarities that are no less
interesting than the differences. If the agrarian world of Russia, in spite
of the streak of communism inherent in the structure of the Russian
village, was practically impervious to the influence of modern
socialism, the agrarian world of the United States provided an anti-
socialist force that stood ready to make short work of any activities on
Marxist lines important enough to be noticed by it. If the industrial
sector of Russia failed to produce a significant socialist mass party
because capitalist evolution was so sluggish, the industrial sector of the
United States failed to do so because capitalist evolution rushed on at
such a vertiginous pace. 11
The most important difference was between the respective intellectual
groups: unlike Russia, the United States did not, until the end of the
nineteenth century, produce an under-employed and frustrated set of
intellectuals. The scheme of values that arose from the national task of
developing the economic possibilities of the country drew nearly all the
brains into business and impressed the businessman’s attitudes upon the soul
of the nation. Outside of New York, intellectuals in our sense were not
numerous enough to count. Most of them moreover accepted this scheme of
values. If they did not. Main Street refused to listen and instinctively frowned
upon them, and this was much more effective in disciplining them than were
the methods of the Russian political police. Middle-class hostility to
railroads, utilities and big business in general absorbed almost all there was
of “revolutionary” energy.
The average competent and respectable workman was, and felt himself
to be, a businessman. He successfully applied himself to exploiting his own
individual opportunities, to getting on or, in any case, to selling his labor
as advantageously as possible. He understood and largely shared his
employer’s way of thinking. When he found it useful to ally himself with
his peers within the same concern, he did so in the same spirit. Since
roughly the middle of the nineteenth century this practice increasingly took
adequate as the result of his supreme ability in handling them. In this respect, though in no
other, Professor Laski’s proskynesis in the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (article
Ulyanov) is fully understandable, provided of course that intellectuals must prostrate themselves
before the idols of their time.
11 The presence of the “frontier” of course greatly reduced the possibilities of friction. The
importance of this element, though great, is however likely to be over-estimated. That pace of
industrial evolution incessantly created new industrial frontiers, and this fact was much more
important than was the opportunity of packing one’s bags and going west.

the form of employees’ committees, the forerunners of the postwar
company unions that acquired their full economic and cultural significance
in company towns. 12
Beyond that, it was frequently good business for the workman to combine
on a national scale with the other members of his craft in order further to
improve his bargaining position as against employers directly and as against
other crafts indirectly. This interest shaped many trade unions that are
typically American, largely accounts for the adoption of the craft principle
which is much more effective than any other principle can be in keeping
away would-be entrants, and really produced workmen’s cartels. Naturally
enough, these cartels displayed that lack of radicalism which was and is so
eloquently lamented by both domestic and foreign socialists and fellow
travelers. Nothing but wage rates and hours mattered to them and they were
quite prepared to study the wishes of the public or even of the employers in
everything else, particularly in their phraseology. This is illustrated to
perfection by the type and behavior of the leaders both of individual unions
and of the American Federation of Labor which embodied that spirit, as well
as by the attempts of the trade-union bureaucracy to enter, with trade-union
funds, the sphere of industrial and financial enterprise that was quite
congenial to them. 13
To be sure, the fact that the creeds and slogans—the ideologies—were so
unrevolutionary and so averse to class war is in itself of limited importance.
American trade unionists were not much given to theorizing. If they had been
they might have put a Marxist interpretation upon their practice. It remains
12 The common sense of the arrangement and its particular suitability to American conditions
are as obvious as is the fact that it was a thorn in the flesh of trade unions and also of the radical
intellectuals of a later type. The slogans of our days—recently officialized—have thus
stigmatized company unions as the product of a diabolical attempt by employers to thwart the
efforts toward effective representation of the workmen’s interests. While this view too is
perfectly understandable from a standpoint from which militant organization of the proletariat
is in the nature of a moral axiom—and from the standpoint of the corporative state that grows
up before our eyes—it vitiates historical interpretation. The fact that employers provided
facilities for this type of organization, often took the initiative and tried to influence it so as to
be able to get along with it, does not exclude or disprove the other fact that company unions
and their forerunners fulfilled a much-needed function and that, in the normal case, they served
the interests of the men quite well.
13 The figure of Warren Sanford Stone, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, affords
an excellent (though later) illustration of the last-mentioned aspect as well as of the others.
Further examples from the time of Samuel Gompers will so readily occur to the reader that
there is no need of mentioning them. But the above should not be interpreted to mean that the
trade union with high entrance fees and long waiting lists which looks so strangely like a copper
corner is or was the only kind of trade union in this country. On the contrary, immigrants
imported every European variety, and, irrespective of this, forms similar to those found in
Europe developed where conditions were favorable, that is, especially in the relatively old and
consolidated locations and branches of industry.
From 1875 to 1914 333
true however that, bargaining aside, they did not consider themselves on the
other side of the fence in all things and that cooperation—which those of
us who do not like it will call collusion—with employers was in accord not
only with their principles but also with the logic of their situation. Beyond
a narrow range of questions, political action was not only unnecessary but
even meaningless to them. And for the influence he was able to exert, the
radical intellectual might just as well have tried to convert the board of the
Pennsylvania Railroad.
But there was another world within the world of American labor. Along
with elements of supernormal quality, immigration included from the first
some substandard ones also which increased in relative as well as absolute
numbers after the Civil War. These numbers were swelled by individuals who,
though not subnormal as to physical fitness or intelligence or energy, yet
gravitated into that group, owing to past misfortunes or to the persistence of
the influence of the unfavorable environments from which they sprang or
simply owing to restlessness, inadaptable temperament or criminal proclivities.
All these types were an easy prey to exploitation which was facilitated by the
absence of moral bonds, and some of them reacted by a blind and impulsive
hatred that readily crystallized into crime. In many new and rapidly growing
industrial communities where people of the most varied origins and
propensities were thrown together and law and order had to be kept, if at all,
by action that was itself outside of the law, rough people, made still rougher
by the treatment they received, faced employers, or agents of employers, who
had not yet developed a sense of responsibility and were often driven to brutal
courses by a fear not only for their property but also for their lives.
There, so the socialist observer is inclined to say, was class war in the
most literal sense—actual guns going off to illustrate the Marxist concept.
As a matter of fact, it was nothing of the sort. It is hard to imagine any
set of conditions less favorable to the development of political laborism or
of serious socialism, and very little of either showed as long as those
conditions lasted.
The history of the Knights of Labor, the one really important and nation-
wide organization of all wageworkers regardless of skill or craft—and in fact
of all who cared to join—covers about a decade of significant power and
activity (1878–1889). In 1886 the Noble Order’s membership was almost
700,000. The part of it which consisted of industrial—mainly unskilled—
laborers energetically participated in or even initiated the strikes or boycotts
that accompanied the depressions of that time. A scrutiny of programs and
pronouncements reveals a somewhat incoherent medley of all sorts of
socialist, cooperative and, occasionally, anarchist ideas that we can trace, if
we wish, to a wide variety of sources—Owen, the English agrarian socialists,
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties334
Marx, and the Fabians among them. The political point of view was much
in evidence and so was the idea of general planning and of social
reconstruction. But such definiteness of aims as we may discover is really
due to our reading back from the standpoint of our own time. In reality there
were no definite aims and it was precisely the comprehensive character of
the ideology of the Good Life—Uriah S.Stephens, the founder, had been
trained for the ministry—and of the American Constitution which appealed
to so many people, farmers and professional men included. The Order thus
was a sort of exchange for the plans of all kinds of reformers. In this respect
it indeed filled a function which its leaders had in mind when they stressed
the educational aspect of its activities. But an organization formed of such
different clays was constitutionally incapable of action. When definitely
socialist profession was insisted on, it broke. Similar movements (Populists,
Henry George’s and others) tell the same tale.
The obvious inference is that in the American environment of that time
there was not and could not be either the requisite material or the requisite
motive power for a socialist mass movement. This can be verified by following
the thread that leads from the Knights to the Industrial Workers of the World.
This thread is embodied in the career of a Marxist intellectual, Daniel De Leon,
and hence should have, for the faithful, considerable specific weight.14 It was
under his command that, in 1893, socialists within the Order of the Knights
rose against the old leader, Powderly, thereby, as it turned out, dealing a death
blow to the organization. The idea was to create an instrument for political
action on more or less Marxian lines. Class war, revolution, destruction of the
capitalist state and the rest of it were to be sponsored by a proletarian party.
But neither the Socialist Labor Party (1890) nor De Leon’s Socialist Trade and
Labor Alliance (1895) had any life in it. Not only was the working-class
following small—this would not in itself have been decisive—but success even
of the Russian kind, that is to say, conquest of a controlling nucleus of
intellectuals, was not attained. The Socialist Labor party first split and then lost
most of the remaining ground to the new Socialist party.
The latter came as near to being an orthodox success as any group did in
this country. To begin with, its origin was orthodox. It arose from the labor
struggles during 1892–1894, when strikes were broken by the use of force,
the federal government and the judiciary lending resolute support to the
14 All the more so as Lenin himself went out of his way to pay homage, quite unusual for
him, to De Leon’s work and thought.
15 It will be observed that this was done at a time when most European governments were
rapidly adopting another attitude. However, this does not simply spell “backwardness” on this
side of the Atlantic. It is true that the social and political prestige of the business interest was
here much greater than anywhere else and that American democracy in consequence took a
much narrower view of labor problems than did, say, the Junker government in Prussia. But
From 1875 to 1914 335
employers. 15 This converted many a man who had been previously a
“conservative” craft unionist. At any rate, it converted Eugene V. Debs first
to industrial unionism and then to the principle of political action. Secondly,
the general attitude adopted by the Socialist party was orthodox. It tried to
work with and to “bore from within” the trade unions. It gave itself a regular
political organization. It was in principle revolutionary in the same sense as
were the great socialist parties of Europe. Its doctrine was not quite orthodox.
In fact it did not stress doctrinal aspects to any great extent—either under
Debs or later—and it allowed considerable latitude to the teaching activities
within its ranks. But though it never succeeded in absorbing the little local
labor parties that kept on cropping up all over the country, it developed fairly
well up to the postwar period when communist competition asserted itself.
A majority of socialists would, I think, agree in calling it the one genuine
socialist party of this country. Its voting strength, though swelled as that of
most socialist parties is by non-socialist sympathizers, measures the scope
there was for serious socialist effort.
De Leon however had another chance. It came from—and went with—
the Western Federation of Miners whose radicalism, quite independent of any
doctrinal background, was nothing but the product of rough people reacting
to a rough environment. This union provided the corner stone for the
structure of the I.W.W. (1905). De Leon and his, associates added the
wreckage of their own and other unsuccessful organizations as well as
splinters mostly of dubious character—intellectual or proletarian or both—
from everywhere and nowhere. But the leadership—and in consequence the
phraseology—was strong. Besides De Leon himself, there were Haywood,
Trautmann, Foster and others.
Shock tactics that knew no inhibitions and the spirit of uncompromising
warfare account for a series of isolated successes, and the absence of
anything else but phrases and shock tactics, for the ultimate failure that was
hastened by quarrels with and defections to the communists as well as by
incessant internal dissensions. But I need not retell a story that has been told
so often from every conceivable standpoint. What matters to us is this. The
organization has been called syndicalist—even anarchist—and later on the
criminal syndicalism laws enacted in several states were applied to it. The
principle of “direct” action on the spot and the doctrinal concession to the
Western Federation of Miners which assigned to industrial unions a basic
one can recognize this and even judge it according to one’s moral or humanitarian standard,
and at the same time also recognize that partly owing to the undeveloped state of public
administration, partly owing to the presence of elements with which no gentler method would
have worked, and partly owing to the nation’s determination to press forward on the road of
economic development, problems did present themselves under a different aspect and would
have done so even to a governmental agency completely free from bourgeois blinkers.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties336
role in the construction of socialist society—De Leon’s contribution to or
deviation from classical Marxism—no doubt suggest that it was. But it seems
more correct to speak of the insertion of syndicalist elements into what
substantially was and remained an offshoot, of the Marxian stem than to base
diagnosis entirely on those elements.
Thus that great sociologist, the man in the street, has been right once
more. He said that socialism and socialists were un-American. If I catch
his meaning, it amounts pretty much to what, less succinctly, I have
been trying to convey. American development practically skipped the
phase of socialism which saw the career of unadulterated Marxism and
of the Second International. Their essential problems were hardly
understood. The attitudes appropriate to them existed only as sporadic
imports. American problems and attitudes occasionally borrowed these
imported articles. But that was all. And the events of the next phase
impinged on intellectuals and on a proletariat that had not gone through
the Marxian school.
IV. T HE F RENCH C ASE ; A NALYSIS O F S YNDICALISM
What syndicalism really is we shall see best in the French picture. 16 Before
attempting to do so we shall briefly note a few things about French
socialism in general.
First, its ideological history goes further back and is perhaps more
distinguished than that of any other. But no single variety of it ever
crystallized so completely and commanded allegiance so widely as did the
socialism of, say, the Fabian type on the one hand and of the Marxian on
the other. Fabian socialism requires English political society, and nothing
like that developed in France—the great revolution and the subsequent
failure of the aristocratic and the bourgeois elements to coalesce prevented
it. Marxian socialism requires a broad and unified labor movement; or, as
a rallying creed for intellectuals, it requires cultural traditions quite
uncongenial to French limpidité. But all the other socialist creeds that have
so far emerged appeal only to particular mentalities and social locations
and are sectarian by nature.
Second, France was typically the country of the peasant, the artisan, the
clerk and the small rentier. Capitalist evolution proceeded by measured steps
and large-scale industry was confined to a few centers. Whatever the issues
that divided these classes, they were economically conservative at first—
nowhere else did conservatism rest on so broad a basis—and later on lent
16 Italian and Spanish syndicalism would do almost equally well. Only, in proportion to the
number of illiterates, the anarchist element increases so much as to distort what I believe to
be the true traits. This element has its place. But it should not be overemphasized.
From 1875 to 1914 337
increasing support to groups that sponsored middle-class reform, among
them the radicaux-socialistes, a party that can be best described by saying
that it was neither radical nor socialist. Many workmen were of the same
sociological type and of the same mind. Many professionals and intellectuals
adapted themselves to it, which accounts for the fact that over-production
and under-employment of intellectuals, though it existed, failed to assert
itself as we should otherwise expect. Unrest there was. But among the
malcontents, the Catholics, who disapproved of the anti-clerical tendencies
that various circumstances brought to the fore in the Third Republic, were
more important than the people who were displeased with the capitalist order
of things. It was from the former and not from the latter that the real danger
to the bourgeois republic arose at the time of the affaire Dreyfus.
Third, it follows that, though again for different reasons, there was not
much more scope for serious socialism in France than there was in Russia
or the United States. Hence she had a variety of socialisms and quasi-
socialisms that were not serious. The Blanquist party whose hope was the
action of “a few resolute men” may serve as an example: a small band of
intellectuals with a bent for conspiracy and professional revolutionists
together with the mob of Paris and two or three other big towns was all
that ever came within the horizon of groups like that. Eventually however
a Marxist parti ouvrier was founded by Guesde and Lafargue with a class-
war program (1883) that had received the sanction of Marx himself. It
developed on orthodox lines, fighting putschism of the Hervé type and
anarchism on the one front and Jaurès’ reformism on the other, much as
its German counterpart did. But it never acquired similar importance and
never meant nearly as much either to the masses or to the intellectuals, in
spite of the merger of socialist groups in the chambre which was achieved
in 1893 (48 seats as compared with the 300 occupied by governmental
republicans) and eventually led to the formation of the Unified Socialist
party (1905).
Fourth, I will simply state the fact, without attempting to go behind it,
that the social pattern glanced at above precluded the emergence of great and
disciplined parties of the English type. Instead, as every one knows,
parliamentary politics became a cotillon of small and unstable groups that
combined and dissolved in response to momentary situations and individual
interests and intrigues, setting up and pulling down cabinets according to the
principles, as I put it before, of a parlor game. One of the consequences of
this was governmental inefficiency. Another was that cabinet office came
within the sight of socialist and quasi-socialist groups sooner than it did in
countries whose socialist parties were much more powerful but whose
politics were run according to somewhat more rational methods. Until the
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties338
national emergency of 1914, Guesde and his group proved impervious to the
temptation and consistently refused cooperation with bourgeois parties in the
best orthodox style. But the reformist group which in any case shaded off
into bourgeois radicalism and whose principles—reform without
revolution—did not condemn such cooperation had really no reason to do
likewise. Jaurès accordingly felt no compunction at the time of the Dreyfus
crisis (1898) in lending support to a bourgeois government in order to defend
the Republic. Thus an old problem of socialist principle and tactics, which
was no problem at all in England or Sweden but a fundamental one
everywhere else, suddenly burst upon the socialist world in a most practical
form. It acquired its particular sting by an additional circumstance:
supporting a bourgeois government was one thing, though bad enough from
the standpoint of rigid orthodoxy, but sharing its responsibilities by actually
entering it was quite another thing. M.Millerand did precisely this. In 1899
he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet—together with M.de Galliffet, a
conservative general who was best known to the public for his vigorous
participation in the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871.
Two patriots sacrificing personal views in order to join forces in a national
emergency—what of it? This, I suppose, will express the reaction of most
of my readers. I need hardly assure them that personally I have no wish to
hold that the two gentlemen disgraced themselves. Moreover, it may well be
questioned whether even then M.Millerand should have been called a
socialist at all. 17 Finally, the French working class has every reason to
remember with gratitude what, legislatively and administratively, he did for
it while in cabinet office.
At the same time, we must try to understand how “Millerandism” was
bound to strike the Guesdists in France and orthodox socialists all over
Europe. For them it spelled lapse and sin, betrayal of the goal, pollution of
the faith. This was very natural and so was the anathema hurled at it by the
international congress of Amsterdam (1904). But beyond and behind the
doctrinal anathema there was a piece of simple common sense. If the
proletariat was not to lend its back for ambitious politicians to use for
climbing into power, every deviation from approved practice had to be most
jealously watched.
17 He had, it is true, risen to prominence among “left-wingers” by defending strike leaders
and when he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet he was the chief figure among the sixty
members of what was called the “socialist left.” However he had done nothing that could not
have been done equally well by a bourgeois radical. His later attitude as minister of public
works (1909) and as minister of war (1912) hence spelled not quite so great a break as his
enemies made out. His subsequent alliance with the bloc national and his conflict with the
cartel des gauches during his tenure of the presidential office after 1920 were different matters
yet they also admit of plausible justifications.
From 1875 to 1914 339
The trick of talking about national emergencies whenever it suits
careerists to make a bid for power—after all, was there ever a situation that
politicians did not consider an emergency?—was too well known and too
discredited to impress anyone, particularly the French proletariat that had
learned to rate political phrases at their true value. There was danger that the
masses might turn away from political socialism in contempt. 18
In fact, there was more than a mere danger. They were actually turning
away from it. Beholding, as the whole nation did, the sorry spectacle of
political inefficiency, incompetence and frivolity that was the product of the
sociological pattern imperfectly sketched above, they placed no trust in the
state, the political world, the scribblers, and had no respect for any of them
or indeed for anything or anybody except the memory of some great figures
of the past. Part of the industrial proletariat had conserved its Catholic faith.
The rest was adrift. And to those who had overcome their bourgeois
propensities, syndicalism was much more attractive than any of the available
species of straight socialism the sponsors of which bade fair to reproduce,
on a smaller scale, the games of the bourgeois parties. Revolutionary
tradition of the French type of which syndicalism was the principal heir, of
course greatly helped.
For syndicalism is not merely revolutionary trade unionism. This may
mean many things which have little to do with it. Syndicalism is apolitical
and anti-political in the sense that it despises action on or through the organs
of traditional politics in general and parliaments in particular. It is anti-
intellectual both in the sense that it despises constructive programs with
theories behind them and in the sense that it despises the intellectual’s
leadership. It really appeals to the workman’s instincts—and not, like
Marxism, to the intellectual’s idea of what the workman’s instincts ought to
be—by promising him what he can understand, viz., the conquest of the shop
he works in, conquest by physical violence, ultimately by the general strike.
Now, unlike Marxism or Fabianism, syndicalism cannot be espoused by
anyone afflicted by any trace of economic or sociological training. There is
no rationale for it. Writers who, acting on the hypothesis that everything
must be amenable to rationalization, try to construct a theory for it inevitably
emasculate it. Some linked it to anarchism which, as a social philosophy, is
completely alien to it in roots, aims and ideology—however similar the
behavior of Bakunin’s workingclass following (1872–1876) may look to us.
Others attempted to subsume it, as a special case characterized by a special
tactical bent, under Marxism, which involves discarding all that is most
essential to both. Still others have constructed a new socialist species to
18 The Italian socialists actually declined the invitation to join the cabinet that was three
times extended to them by Giolitti (1903, 1906, 1911).
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties340
function as the Platonic idea of it—guild socialism—but in doing so they had
to commit the movement to a definite schema of ultimate values the absence
of which is one of its salient features. The men who organized and led the
Confédération Générale du Travail during its syndicalist stage (1895–1914)
were mostly genuine proletarians or trade-union officers, or both. They were
brimming over with resentment and with the will to fight. They did not
bother about what they would do with the wreckage in case of success. Is
that not enough? Why should we refuse to recognize the truth which life
teaches us every day—that there is such a thing as pugnacity in the abstract
that neither needs nor heeds any argument and cares for nothing except for
victory as such?
But any intellectual can fill the void behind that brute violence in the
way that suits his taste. And the violence itself, combined with the anti-
intellectualism and the anti-democratic slant, acquires a significant
connotation if viewed in the setting of a disintegrating civilization that
so many people hate for all kinds of reasons. Those who at the time felt
like that but hated not so much the economic arrangements of capitalist
society as its democratic rationalism were not free to fall back on
orthodox socialism which promises still more rationalism. To their
intellectual anti-intellectualism—whether Nietzschean or Bergsonian—the
syndicalist anti-intellectualism of the fist may well have appealed as the
complement—in the world of the masses—of their own creed. Thus a
very strange alliance actually came to pass, and syndicalism found its
philosopher after all in Georges Sorel.
Of course all revolutionary movements and ideologies that coexist at any
time always have a lot in common. They are the products of the same social
process and must in many respects react in similar ways to similar
necessities. Also, they cannot avoid borrowing from each other or splashing
each other with their colors in their very squabbles. Finally, individuals as
well as groups often do not know where, if anywhere, they belong and,
sometimes from ignorance, at other times from a correct perception of
advantage, they mix up contradictory principles into mongrel creeds of their
own. All this confuses observers and accounts for the wide variety of current
interpretations. It is particularly confusing in the case of syndicalism which
flourished only so short a time and was soon to be deserted by its intellectual
exponents. Nevertheless, however we may appraise what syndicalism meant
to Sorel and what Sorel meant to syndicalism, his Reflexions sur la Violence
and his Illusions du Progrès do help us toward a diagnosis. That his
economics and his sociology completely differed from those of Marx may
in itself not mean much. But standing as it does right in the midst of the anti-
intellectualist torrent, Sorel’s social philosophy sheds a flood of light on the
From 1875 to 1914 341
first practical manifestation of a social force that was and is revolutionary
in a sense in which Marxism was not.

But why was it that the English methods and tactics did not prevail in
Germany? Why that Marxist success which accentuated antagonisms and
split the nation into two hostile camps? This would be easy to understand if
there had been no extra-socialist groups to work for social reconstruction or
if the ruling stratum had turned a deaf ear to their proposals. It becomes a
riddle as soon as we realize that German public authority was not less but
more alive to the social exigencies of the time than was English political
society and that the work of the Fabians was being done not less but more
effectively by a very similar group.
Germany did not lag behind but, until the passing of the security
legislation primarily associated with the name of Lloyd George, led in
matters of “social policy.” Also, it was the government’s initiative that placed
those measures for social betterment on the statute book, and not pressure
from below asserting itself by exasperating struggles. Bismarck initiated
social insurance legislation. The men who developed it and added other lines
of social improvement were conservative civil servants (von Berlepsch,
Count Posadowsky) carrying out the directions of William II. The institutions
created were truly admirable achievements and they were so considered all
over the world. Simultaneously, trade-union activity was unfettered and a
significant change occurred in the attitude of public authority toward strikes.
The monarchist garb in which all this appeared no doubt constitutes a
difference as against the English procedure. But this difference made for
more and not less success. The monarchy, after having for a time given in
to economic liberalism (“Manchesterism” as its critics called it), simply
returned to its old traditions by doing—mutatis mutandis—for the workmen
what it had previously done for the peasants. The civil service, much more
developed and much more powerful than in England, provided excellent
administrative machinery as well as the ideas and the drafting skill for
legislation. And this civil service was at least as amenable to proposals of
social reform as was the English one. Largely consisting of impecunious
Junkers—many of whom had no other means of subsistence than their truly
Spartan salaries—entirely devoted to its duty, well educated and informed,
highly critical of the capitalist bourgeoisie, it took to the task as a fish takes
to water.
Ideas and proposals normally came to the bureaucracy from its teachers
at the universities, the “socialists of the chair.” Whatever we may think of
the scientific achievements of the professors who organized themselves into
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties342
the Verein für Sozialpolitik19 and whose work often lacked scientific
refinement, they were aglow with a genuine ardor for social reform and
entirely successful in spreading it. They resolutely faced bourgeois
displeasure not only in framing individual measures of practical reform but
also in propagating the spirit of reform. Like the Fabians, they were primarily
interested in the work at hand and they deprecated class war and revolution.
But, also like the Fabians, they knew where they were going—they knew and
did not mind that socialism loomed at the end of their way. Of course, the
state socialism they envisaged was national and conservative. But it was
neither a fake nor utopian.
The world at large never understood this social pattern and the nature of
the constitutional monarchy it produced. At any rate, it has forgotten
whatever it may have once known. But as soon as we get a glimpse of the
truth, we find it still more difficult to understand how in that unplutocratic
environment it was possible for the greatest of all socialist parties to grow
up on a purely Marxist program and on a Marxist phraseology of
unsurpassed virulence, pretending to fight ruthless exploitation and a state
that was the slave of slave drivers. Surely this cannot be explained by the
“logic of the objective social situation.”
Well, I suppose we must recognize once more that in the short run—and
forty years is short run in such matters—methods and mistakes, individual
and group-wise manque de savoir faire, may count for much more than that
logic. Everything else I could point to is obviously inadequate. There was,
of course, the struggle for the extension of the franchise in the legislatures
of the individual states. But much of what was most important to the
industrial masses was within the competence of the imperial parliament
(Reichstag) and for it Bismarck had introduced universal manhood suffrage
from the first. More important was protection for agriculture—dear bread.
No doubt this did much to poison the atmosphere, especially because its
principal beneficiaries were the big and medium-sized estates in eastern
Prussia and not the peasants. However, as to the real pressure exerted by it,
the fact is conclusive that around 1900 emigration practically ceased. No—
explanation cannot lie on that route.
But that manque de savoir faire plus German manners! We may make
things clearer by the obvious analogy with Germany’s behavior in matters
of international relations. Before 1914, Germany’s colonial and other foreign
19 I really wish I could induce the reader to peruse the short history of that unique
organization that was so characteristic of what imperial Germany really was, though it has not
been and probably never will be translated. Its author was for decades secretary of the Verein,
and his story is only the more impressive for being so unpretentious. (Franz Boese, Geschichte
des Vereins für Sozialpolitik, Berlin, 1939.)
From 1875 to 1914 343
ambitions were—so it seems right to say at this distance of time—distinctly
modest, especially if we compare them with the neat and effective moves by
which England and France at that time increased their empires. Nothing that
Germany actually did or indicated any intention of doing will bear
comparison with, say, Tel-El-Kebir or with the Boer War or with the
conquest of Tunisia or of French Indo-China. All the less modest and all the
more aggressive, however, was the talking that Germans indulged in, and
unbearably offensive was the swashbuckling manner in which even
reasonable claims were presented. Worse than this, no line was ever adhered
to; headlong forward rushes in ever-changing directions alternated with
blustering retreats, undignified propitiations with uncalled-for rebuffs, until
all the factors that make the world’s opinion were thoroughly disgusted as
well as disquieted. 20 Things were no different in domestic affairs.
The fatal mistake was really Bismarck’s. It consisted in the attempt,
explicable only on the hypothesis that he completely misconceived the nature
of the problem, at suppressing socialist activities by coercion culminating in
a special enactment (Sozialistengesetz) which he carried in 1878 and which
remained in force until 1890 (when William II insisted on its repeal), that is
to say, long enough to educate the party and to subject it for the rest of the
prewar period to the leadership of men who had known prison and exile and
had acquired much of the prisoner’s and exile’s mentality. Through an
unfortunate combination of circumstances, it so happened that this vitiated
the whole course of subsequent events. For the one thing those exile-shaped
men could not stand was militarism and the ideology of military glory. And
the one thing which the monarchy—otherwise in sympathy with a large part
of what reasonable socialists considered as immediately practical aims—
could not stand was sneers at the army and at the glories of 1870. More than
anything else, this was for both what defined the enemy as distinguished
from the mere opponent. Add Marxian phraseology—however obviously
academic—at the party conventions on the one hand and the aforesaid
blustering on the other, and you have the picture. No amount of fruitful
social legislation and no amount of law-abiding behavior availed against that
reciprocal non possumus, that cardboard barrier across which the two hosts
20 I want to make it quite clear that the above is not intended to attribute this policy, either
wholly or primarily, to William II. He was no insignificant ruler. Moreover, he was fully entitled
to the comment made upon him by Prince Bülow in the most unusual defense ever made for a
monarch in a parliament: “Say what you will, he is no philistine.” If he quarreled with the one
man who could have taught him the technique of his craft, critics of his behavior to Bismarck
should not forget that the quarrel was mainly about the persecution of socialists which the
emperor wished to discontinue and about the inauguration of a great program of social
legislation. If one disregards talk and simply tries to reconstruct intentions by following the
emperor’s acts from year to year, one cannot help arriving at the conclusion that he was often
right in his views about the great questions of his time.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties344
reviled each other, made the most terrible faces at each other, devoured each
other in principle—all without really meaning any serious harm.
From this state of things a situation developed that no doubt had its
dangers—great power without responsibility is always dangerous—but was
not anything like as uncomfortable as it might seem. The federal and state
governments—or the old civil servants promoted to cabinet rank who formed
those governments—cared primarily for honest and efficient administration,
for beneficial and on the whole progressive legislation, and for the army and
navy estimates. None of these objects was seriously jeopardized by the
adverse votes of the socialists, the passing of the army and navy estimates
in particular being assured most of the time by the support of a large
majority of the population. The Social Democratic party in turn, well
organized and brilliantly led by August Bebel, was absorbed in consolidating
and expanding its vote which in fact increased by leaps and bounds. This
was not seriously interfered with by the governments, the bureaucracy
scrupulously observing the letter of the law which gave all the freedom of
action really necessary for partisan activity. 21 And both the managing
bureaucracy and the party had reason to be grateful to each other, especially
during Bülow’s tenure of power, for providing outlets for oratorical excess
capacity of which both of them stood in need.
Thus the party not only developed satisfactorily but also settled down.
A party bureaucracy, a party press, a staff of elder statesmen developed,
all adequately financed, as a rule secure in their positions and, on the
whole, highly respectable in every—and also in the bourgeois—sense of
the word. A nucleus of working-class members grew up for whom
membership was no longer a question of choice but a matter of course.
More and more people were “born into the party” and educated to
unquestioning acceptance of its leadership and catechism which then, for
some of them, meant as much and no more than religious catechisms mean
to the average man or woman of today.
All this was greatly facilitated by the inability of the non-socialist parties
to compete effectively for the labor vote. There was an exception to this. The
Centrist (Catholic) party, on the one hand, commanded all the talent required
because it had the support of a priesthood of quite exceptionally high quality
and, on the other hand, was prepared to make a bid for the labor vote by
going as far in the direction of social reform as it felt itself able to do without
21 Administrative vexations were doubtless not absent, and socialists of course made the
most of everything that could by any stretch be styled as vexatious. But this sort of thing did
not go to great lengths as in fact the history of socialist activity from 1890 to the First World
War in itself suffices to prove. Moreover, vexations of this kind are really in the nature of a
service to the “persecuted”
From 1875 to 1914 345
affronting its right wing, and by taking its stand on the doctrines of the
encyclicals Immortale Dei (1885) and Rerum Novarum (1891). 22 But all the
other parties, though for different reasons and in different degrees, stood on
a footing of mutual distrust, if not of hostility, with the industrial proletariat
and never so much as attempted to sell themselves to any significant number
of labor voters. These, unless they were active Catholics, accordingly had
hardly any party to turn to other than the Social Democratic party.
Unbelievable as such ineptitude seems in the light of English and American
experience, it is yet a fact that the socialist army was allowed, amid all the
clamor about the horrible dangers threatening from it, to march into
politically unguarded territory.
We are now in a position to understand what, on the face of it, seems
so incomprehensible, viz., why German socialists so tenaciously clung to
the Marxian creed. For a powerful party that could afford a distinctive
creed yet was completely excluded not only from political responsibility
but from any immediate prospect of it, it was natural to conserve the
purity of the Marxian faith once it had been embraced. That purely
negative attitude toward non-socialist reform and all the doings of the
bourgeois state—which as we have seen above was the tactical principle
Marx recommended for all save exceptional cases—was really thrust
upon it. The leaders were not irresponsible nor were they desperadoes.
But they realized that in the given situation there was not much for the
party to do except to criticize and to keep the banner flying. Any sacrifice
of revolutionary principle would have been perfectly gratuitous. It would
have only disorganized their following without giving to the proletariat
much more than it got in any case, not on the initiative of the other
parties but on that of the monarchist bureaucracy. Such small additional
successes as might have been attained hardly warranted the party risk.
Thus, serious, patriotic and law-abiding men continued to repeat the
irresponsible slogans of revolution and treason—the sanguinary
implications of which came so strangely from many a pacific and
bespectacled countenance—blissfully conscious of the fact that there was
little likelihood of their having to act upon them.
Before long however the suspicion began to dawn upon a few of them
that some day or other the revolutionary talk might meet the most deadly
22 Let us note in passing an interesting (almost American) phenomenon: here we have a
political party that comprised within itself almost all shades of opinion on economic and
social questions that it is possible to have, from the starkest conservatism to radical socialism,
and yet was a most powerful political engine. Men of the most different types, origins and
desires, extreme democrats and extreme authoritarians, cooperated with a smoothness that
might have roused the envy of the Marxists, solely on the strength of their allegiance to the
Catholic Church.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties346
weapon of political controversy—smiles. Perhaps it was an apprehension of
this kind or simply the perception of the almost ludicrous discrepancy
between Marxian phraseology and the social reality of those times that
eventually prompted no less a personage than old Engels to pronounce ex
cathedra—that is to say, in a preface he wrote to a new edition of Marx’s
Class Struggles in France23 —that street fighting presented certain
inconveniences after all and that the faithful need not necessarily feel
committed to it (1895).
This timely and modest adjustment roused the wrath of a small minority
of thoroughgoing hotspurs, Mrs. Rosa Luxemburg in particular surpassing
herself in fiery denunciations of the old man. But it was acquiesced in by
the party—possibly with a sigh of relief—and further cautious steps in the
same direction might perhaps have been tactfully made. When however
Eduard Bernstein coolly proceeded to “revise” the whole structure of the
party creed, there was a major row. After what I have said about the situation
this should not be surprising.
Even the most worldly party is aware of the dangers involved in altering
any of its more important planks. In the case of a party whose program and
whose very existence were based on a creed every detail of which had been
worked out with theological fervor, root-and-branch reform was bound to
mean a terrific shock. That creed was the object of quasi-religious reverence.
It had been upheld for a quarter of a century. Under its flag the party had
marched to success. It was all the party had to show. And now the beloved
revolution—that was to them what the Second Coming of the Lord was to
the early Christians—was to be unceremoniously called off. No class war any
more. No thrilling war cries. Cooperation with bourgeois parties instead. All
this from a member of the old guard, a former exile, and, as it happened,
one of the most lovable members of the party!
But Bernstein 24 went further still. He laid sacrilegious hands on the
hallowed foundations of the doctrine. He attacked the Hegelian background.
The labor theory of value and the exploitation theory came in for stricture.
He doubted the inevitability of socialism and reduced it to tame
“desirability.” He looked askance at the economic interpretation of history.
Crises would not kill the capitalist, dragon; on the contrary, with time
capitalism would gain in stability. Growing misery was nonsense of course.
Bourgeois liberalism had produced lasting values which it was worth while
23 It has been shown by Ryazanov that the editor of this book took liberties with Engels’
text. But the above argument is not affected by even the highest possible estimate of the ravages
of his pencil. See Ryazanov, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (translated by Kunitz, 1927).
24 The two books of his that are most relevant for our purpose are Die Voraussetzungen des
Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (1899), translation by E.C.Harvey, 1909,
and Zur Ceschichte und Theorie des Sozialismus (1901).
From 1875 to 1914 347
trying to conserve. He even said that the proletariat was not everything.
Think of that!
This of course was more than the party could stand. It would have been
unbearable even if Bernstein had been incontestably right on every point,
for creeds embodied in an organization cannot be reformed by means of
holocausts. But he was not. He was an excellent man but he was not
Marx’s intellectual peer. We have seen in Part I that he went too far in the
matter of the economic interpretation of history which he can hardly have
fully understood. He also went too far in his assertion that developments
in the agrarian sector refute Marx’s theory of the concentration of
economic control. And there were other points inviting effective reply so
that the champion of orthodoxy, Karl Kautsky, 25 found it not too difficult
to hold his ground—or some of it. Nor is it so clear that it would have been
to the advantage of the party had Bernstein’s tactical recommendations
prevailed. A wing would certainly have broken away. The prestige of the
party would have suffered greatly. And, as has been stated before, no
immediate gain would have accrued. There was hence a lot to be said for
the “conservative” view.
Under the circumstances, the course which Bebel took was neither so
obviously unwise nor so obviously tyrannical as fellow travelers and other
critics made out at the time. He denounced Revisionism vigorously, so
vigorously as to keep his hold on his leftists. He had it anathematized at the
conventions in Hanover (1899) and Dresden (1903). But he saw to it that
the resolutions reaffirming class war and other articles of faith were so
framed as to make it possible for “revisionists” to submit. They did, and no
further measures were taken against them though there was, I believe, some
cracking of the whip. Bernstein himself was allowed to enter the Reichstag
with the support of the party. Von Vollmar remained in the fold.
Trade-union leaders shrugged their shoulders and murmured about the
chewing of doctrinal cud. They had been revisionists all along. But so long
as the party did not interfere in their immediate concerns and so long as it
did not call upon them to do anything they really disliked, they did not much
care. They extended protection to some revisionists and also to some of their
literary organs. They made it quite clear that, whatever the party’s
philosophy, business was business. But that was all.
The intellectual revisionists for whom doctrine was not a matter of
25 From that time on, Kautsky, the founder and editor of the Neue Zeit and author of several
treatises on Marxist theory, held a position that can be described only in ecclesiastical terms,
upholding the “revolutionary” doctrine against revisionism as he was later on to uphold
orthodoxy against the bolshevik heretics. He was the most professorial of men and much less
lovable than Bernstein. On the whole, however, both sections of the party must be congratulated
on the moral as as on the intellectual level of their champions.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties348
indifference, and the non-socialist sympathizers some of whom would have
liked to join a socialist party that did not stress class war and revolution,
thought differently of course. It was they who talked about a party crisis and
shook their heads about the future of the party. They had every reason to do
so. For their future in and around the party was indeed jeopardized. In fact
Bebel, himself no intellectual and no friend to parlor pinks, lost no time in
warning them off the premises. The rank and file of the party however were
but little disturbed about all this. They followed their leaders and repeated
their slogans until, without any compunction about what Marx or, for that
matter, Bebel would have said, they rushed to arms in order to defend their
country.
Some interesting light is shed on the development we have just been
surveying by the parallel yet different development in Austria.26 As we should
expect from the much slower pace of capitalist development, it took twenty
years longer to become a political factor of importance. Rising slowly from
small and not very creditable beginnings, it eventually established itself in
1888 (convention of Hainfeld) under Victor Adler, who had succeeded in the
almost desperate task of welding together the socialists of all the nations who
inhabited that country and who was to lead them, with consummate ability,
for another thirty years.
Now this party was also officially Marxist. The little circle of brilliant
Jews that formed its intellectual nucleus, 27 the Neo-Marxists, even
contributed substantially to the development of Marxian doctrine as we have
seen in Part I—going on along orthodox lines, altering them no doubt in the
process but fighting, bitterly and ably, anyone else who tried to do so, and
always keeping to the revolutionary ideology in its most uncompromising
form. The relations with the German party were close and cordial. At the
same time, everyone knew that Adler would stand no nonsense. Having, for
cultural and racial reasons, much more authority over his intellectual
extremists than Bebel ever had over his, he was able to allow them all the
Marxism they wanted in their cafés and to use them whenever he saw fit
without letting them interfere with what really mattered to him, the
organization and the party press, universal suffrage, progressive legislation
and, yes, the proper working of the state. This combination of Marxist
26 By Austria I here mean the western half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy which since
1866 had a parliament and a government (lacking however the departments of foreign affairs
and of war) of its own that were coordinated on a footing of equality with the parliament and
government of the eastern half—Hungary or, to use official language, “the countries of the Holy
Crown of St. Stephen.” The Hungarian Social Democratic party took its pattern from the
Austrian, but never attained quantitative significance.
27 Trotsky, as yet under the name of Bronstein, occasionally showed up among them and
seems to have experienced their influence.
From 1875 to 1914 349
doctrine and reformist practice answered admirably. The Austrian
governments soon discovered that here was a factor, no less important than
the church or the army, that from its own interest was bound to support the
central authority in its perennial struggle with filibustering nationalist
oppositions, particularly the German and the Czech. These governments—
mostly civil servants’ cabinets as in Germany although attempts were made
incessantly by the crown to insert politicians, at least as ministers without
portfolio—thereupon proceeded to extend favors to the party, which
reciprocated in full. 28 And when a government (a civil servants’ cabinet
headed by Baron Gautsch) took up the cause of universal suffrage, Adler,
without encountering any opposition among his followers, was able to
declare publicly that, for the time being, the socialists were a “governmental
party” (Regierungspartei), although cabinet office was neither offered nor
would have been acceptable to them. 29
VI. T HE S ECOND I NTERNATIONAL
The internationalist plank in the program of the Marxist parties called for
an international organization like the defunct First International. The other
socialist and laborite groups were not internationalist in the sense of the
Marxian creed. But, partly from the inheritance of bourgeois radicalism and
partly from aversion to the upper-class governments of their respective
nations, they had all of them acquired, though in varying degrees,
internationalist and pacifist views and sympathies so that international
cooperation occurred readily to them. The foundation of the Second
International (1889) thus embodied a compromise that really attempted to
reconcile the irreconcilable but worked until 1914. A few remarks will suffice
on this subject.
There was the international bureau. And there were the congresses with
their full-dress debates on questions of tactics and of principle. Measured by
tangible achievements, the importance of the Second International might well
be equated to zero. And at zero it has indeed been evaluated both by
revolutionary activists and by laborites. As a matter of fact, however, it was
not meant for immediate action of any sort; action, whether revolutionary
28 A device which the socialists repeatedly used in order to help the government was this.
When nationalist filibusters paralyzed parliament and all business was at a standstill, they would
move “urgency” for the budget. The urgency motion when duly passed practically meant that
the measure thus declared urgent went through if there was a majority for it (which was always
available in the case of the budget) irrespective of those formal rules of parliamentary procedure
which the filibuster made it impossible to observe.
29 The chief difficulty was, I suppose, in the strong stand that the German party had taken
in the matter. Scruples of the Austrian socialists themselves were second in importance.
Aversion of the Austrian bureaucracy or of the old Emperor, if any, was a bad third among the
factors which prevented that consummation.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties350
or reformist, could at that time have been only national. It was to organize
contacts between the affiliated parties and groups, to standardize views, to
coordinate lines of advance, to restrain the irresponsible, and to urge on the
laggard, to create, as far as possible, an international socialist opinion. All
of this was, from the socialist standpoint, extremely desirable and important
though in the nature of things positive results would have taken many
decades to mature.
Accordingly, the chief and the members of the bureau were anything
but a directing board of international socialism. There was no policy for
them to shape and no program to impose such as there had been in the
case of the First International. The national parties and labor groups were
left perfectly autonomous and free to join other international
organizations that might suit their particular aims. Trade unions—also
cooperatives and educational bodies—were welcomed and even courted
but they did not play the leading role. The national parties were
nevertheless kept on a common ground that was sufficiently broad for
Stauning and Branting on the one hand and Lenin and Guesde on the
other to move on. Some of the members of that international institute no
doubt sneered at the chicken-hearted reserve of others and the latter
objected to the hotheaded radicalism of the former. And sometimes things
came perilously near a showdown. On the whole however they all took
a course in socialist diplomacy at the hands of one another. Since this
modus vivendi—with plenty of freedom for agreeing to differ—was the
only possible one, this was in itself a great achievement.
Strange as it may sound, it was the Germans who were—with Russian and
Guesdist support—primarily responsible for it. They were the one great
Marxist party and they gave the common ground a coating of Marxism. But
they realized quite clearly that the majority of the men who represented the
socialist forces outside of Germany were not Marxists. For most of these men
it was a case of signing the thirty-nine articles while reserving an unlimited
freedom of interpretation. Naturally enough, the more ardent believers were
shocked at this and talked about the faith being degraded to a matter of form
that had no substance in it. The German leaders however put up with it. They
even tolerated straight heresy which they would have attacked furiously at
home. Bebel knew how far he could go and that his forbearance,
immediately met as it was by English forbearance, would pay in the end as,
without the war, it assuredly would have done. Thus he maneuvered to
cement the proletarian front with a view to vitalizing it in time, and in doing
so he showed an ability that, if Germany’s diplomacy had had it, might have
prevented the First World War.
Some results did mature. The somewhat indefinite discussions of the first
From 1875 to 1914 351
decade or so were eventually focused on foreign policy and something like
a common view began eventually to emerge. It was a race against time. This
race was lost. Every journalist who now refers to that epoch feels entitled
to condemn the International for what he styles the failure of international
socialism at the outbreak of the catastrophe. But this is a most superficial
view to take. The extraordinary congress at Basle (1912) and its appeal to
the workers of all nations to exert themselves for peace was surely all that
it was possible to do under those circumstances. A call for a general strike
issued to an international proletariat that exists nowhere except in the
imagination of a few intellectuals would not have been more effective, it
would have been less so. To achieve the possible is not failure but success,
however inadequate the success may prove in the end. If failure there was,
it occurred at the domestic fronts of the individual national parties.

CHAPTER XXVII
FROM THE FIRST TO THE SECOND
WORLD WAR
I. T HE “G RAN R IFIUTO ”
A S MEMBERS of their international organization, the socialist parties
had done all they could to avert the war. But when nevertheless it broke
out, they rallied to their national causes with a readiness that was truly
astounding. The German Marxists hesitated even less than the English
laborites. 1 Of course it must be borne in mind that every belligerent nation
was fully convinced that it was waging a purely defensive war—every war
is defensive or at least “preventive” in the eyes of the nations that wage it. 2
Still, if we reflect that the socialist parties had an indubitable constitutional
right to vote against war budgets and that within the general moral schema
of bourgeois democracy there is no obligation to identify oneself with
national policy—men far removed from socialist anti-militarism in fact
disapproved of the war in all the belligerent countries—we seem to face a
problem that is not solved by doubtful references to Marx or to previous
declarations by Bebel and von Vollmar that they would defend their country
if attacked. There should have been no difficulty in recalling Marx’s true
teaching on the subject. Moreover, defending one’s country means only
doing one’s duty with the army; it does not imply voting with the
government and entering into unions sacrées.3 Guesde and Sembat in France
and Vandervelde in Belgium who took office in war cabinets, and the
German socialists who voted the war budgets, thus did more than loyalty to
their nations required, as then commonly understood. 4
There is but one solution to the puzzle. Whether or not the majority
of socialist politicians believed in Marxian internationalism—perhaps
this belief had by that time shared the fate of the cognate belief in a
1 The English Labour party was in fact alone in making a serious stand for peace in 1914,
though it joined the war coalition later on.
2 This is why the attempt made by the victors to decide the moral issue by means of a clause
in an imposed peace treaty was not only so unfair but also so foolish.
3 Nor is it true that failure to do so would have weakened the national cause. Lord Morley’s
resignation clearly did not injure England.
4 Many of us will think differently at present. But this merely shows how far we have
traveled from the old moorings of liberal democracy. To exalt national unity into a moral precept
spells acceptance of one of the most important principles of fascism.
From the First to the Second World War 353
spectacular revolution—they certainly realized that any stand taken
upon the gospel would have cost them their following. The masses
would have first stared at them and then they would have renounced
allegiance, thereby refuting via facti the Marxian doctrine that the
proletarian has no country and that class war is the only war that
concerns him. In this sense, and with a proviso to the effect that things
might have been different if the war had impinged after a longer spell
of evolution within the bourgeois framework, a vital pillar of the
Marxian structure broke in August 1914. 5
This was in fact widely felt. It was felt in the conservative camp: German
conservatives suddenly began to refer to the socialist party in language that
was the pink of courtesy. It was felt in that part of the socialist camp in
which the faith still retained its old ardor. Even in England MacDonald lost
the leadership of the labor party and eventually his seat rather than join the
war coalition. In Germany, Kautsky and Haase left the majority (March
1916) and in 1917 organized the Independent Social Democratic party,
though most of its important members returned to the fold in 1919. 6 Lenin
declared that the Second International was dead and that the cause of
socialism had been betrayed.
There was an element of truth in this. So far as the majorities of the
Marxist parties were concerned, socialism at the crossroads had in fact
not stood the test. It had not chosen the Marxist route. The creeds, the
slogans, the ultimate goals, the organizations, the bureaucracies, the
leaders had not changed. They remained on the morrow of the gran
rifiuto what they had been on its eve. But what they meant and stood for
had changed all the more. After that experimentum crucis neither
socialists nor anti-socialists could any longer look at those parties in the
same light as before. Nor could those parties themselves go on with their
old antics. For better and for worse they had stepped out of their ivory
tower. They had testified to the fact that the fate of their countries meant
more to them than did the socialist goal.
The case was different however with those of them who, like the Social
Democratic parties of the Scandinavian countries, never had been in any
ivory tower. And even with the others the case will look different to observers
5 To some extent this must also be attributed to the success of non-socialist reforms.
6 It is worth noting that the Independents recruited themselves by no means exclusively from
the uncompromising Marxists. Kautsky and Haase belonged to that sector, but many who joined
with them did not. Bernstein, for instance, joined and so did several other revisionists whose
motive cannot have been respect for the Marxian faith. But there is nothing to wonder at in
this. Orthodox Marxism was of course not the only reason a socialist might have had for
disapproving the course taken by the majority. These revisionists simply shared Ramsay
MacDonald’s persuasion.

who never took those revolutionary antics seriously. As regards the German
party in particular, it may well be nearer the truth to say that the “social
traitors”—as they were dubbed—simply came down from unrealistic clouds
and that the national emergency taught them to stand on their feet instead
of on their heads—which, so some of us will add, was all to their credit and
no rifiuto at all. But whichever view we take, there cannot be any doubt that
the new attitude of responsibility drastically shortened the long stretch that
before 1914 seemed to lie between them and the natural goal of every
party—office. I am far indeed from attributing to German Social Democrats
any calculations of this kind or from doubting the sincerity of their decision
not to take office in bourgeois society. But it is obvious that, as a result of
the stand they took at the beginning of the war, they were—if I may say so—
“sitting pretty” at the end of it. Unlike the other parties, they had not
compromised themselves by running along in full cry. But neither had they
deserted their nation in the hour of danger.
II. T HE E FFECTS O F T HE F IRST W ORLD W AR O N T HE C HANCES O F
T HE S OCIALIST P ARTIES O F E UROPE
1. Any major war that ends in defeat will shake the social fabric and
threaten the position of the ruling group; the loss of prestige resulting from
military defeat is one of the hardest things for a regime to survive. I do
not know of any exception to this rule. But the converse proposition is not
so certain. Unless success be quick or, at all events, striking and clearly
associated with the performance of the ruling stratum—as was, for
instance, Germany’s success in 1870—exhaustion, economic, physical and
psychological may well produce, even in the case of victory, effects on the
relative position of classes, groups and parties that do not differ essentially
from those of defeat.
The First World War illustrates this. In the United States the effort had
not been sufficiently prolonged and exhausting to show it. Even here the
administration responsible for the war suffered a crushing defeat at the
polls. But in all other victorious countries the prestige of the ruling strata
and their hold on their people were impaired and not enhanced. For the
fortunes of the German and English socialist parties, this meant the advent
of power or, at all events, office. In Germany control of the central organs
of society was thrust upon the party: though in order to save doctrinal face
some of them as well as some anti-socialists insisted on speaking of a
revolution, the fact was that they undertook government by request—and
a humble request it was. In England the labor vote that had been at little
over half a million in January 1910 and not quite two millions and a
quarter in 1918, 7 went to 4,236,733 in 1922 and to 5,487,620 in 1924
From the First to the Second World War 355
(8,362,594 in 1929). MacDonald reconquered the leadership and in 1924
the party came into office if not really into power. In France the structure
of the political world prevented any such clear-cut consummation, but the
general contours were the same: there was a syndicalist revival immediately
after the war, but the Confédération Générale du Travail, leaving the newly
founded Confédération Générale du Travail Syndicaliste and the
communist Confédération Générale du Travail Unitaire to absorb
inadaptable elements, discouraged revolutionary courses and slowly
prepared itself for a dominant political role.
Moreover, the socialist or quasi-socialist parties who then shouldered
the responsibility that came to them may well have felt that they had
almost a monopoly of many of the qualifications required in order to
make a success of their venture. Better than any other group they were
able to handle the masses that seethed with discontent. As the German
example shows, they even were in a better position than anyone else was
for the time being to deal firmly with revolutionary outbreaks—if need
be, by force. At any rate, they were the very people to administer the
right dose of social reform, to carry it on the one hand, and to make the
masses accept it on the other. Most important of all, they were, from their
standpoint, quite justified in believing that they were also the people to
heal the wounds the “imperialist war” had inflicted, to restore
international relations and to clear up the mess which, without any fault
of theirs, purely bourgeois governments had made of the peace. In this
they committed the same kind of error which from a different standpoint
was committed by their bourgeois competitors who believed in collective
security, the League of Nations, the reconstruction of gold currencies and
the removal of trade barriers. But once we grant the erroneous premise
we must also grant that the socialists were right in hoping for success,
particularly in the field of foreign policy.
2. The achievements of the two MacDonald governments—MacDonald’s
and Henderson’s work at the foreign office—are sufficient to illustrate this.
But the German case is still more significant. First of all, only the Social
Democrats were in a moral position to accept the peace treaty and to support
a policy that aimed at fulfilling its provisions. They lamented the national
catastrophe, of course, and the burdens it imposed. But feeling as they did
about military glory, neither the defeat itself nor the peace spelled unbearable
humiliation for them. Some of them almost subscribed to the Anglo-French
theory of the war. Most of them cared little for rearmament. While other
Germans looked on in sullen disgust, they worked for peaceful understanding

and the simplification of the electoral qualification.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties356
with the victors in a spirit that was perfectly free, if not from resentment,
yet from passionate hatred. In the matter of what to others was an imposed
democracy, they even saw eye to eye with the western nations: having
disposed of the communist revolts in 1918–1919 and having by judicious
compromise acquired a dominant role in domestic politics, they were in their
most democratic mood.
Second, their hold on the masses was strong enough to make this attitude
politically effective. For the moment, a great part of the population saw
things in the same light. Their views of the situation and the right way of
dealing with it temporarily became the official view whatever the politics of
the government that happened to be in office. They provided the political
support for the coalitions which negotiated the Dawes plan and the Locarno
pact and which could never have been formed or, if formed, could never have
taken that line without them. Stresemann was no socialist. Yet the policy
associated with his name was the policy of the Social Democratic party—
the policy for which they were to get all the credit during one decade and
all the punishment in another.
Third, they were at an advantage in their relations to political opinion
abroad. The world knew little about Germany. But it understood two things:
on the one hand, it realized that there was a party that was ready to accept
for good many of the postwar arrangements and in fact quite approved of
some of them, a party that was the enemy of what France and England had
convinced themselves was their enemy; on the other hand, it realized that
German Social Democracy need not be feared on other counts—however
conservative a government might be, there was no need for it to object to
German as it did object to Russian socialism. In the long run this was a
weakness. It had much to do with the dilatory treatment dealt out to German
grievances, for it induced the foreign offices of England and France to
believe that Germany would remain indefinitely the meek petitioner who
could be made happy by assurances that some day he might be promoted to
a position of equality with the superior nations. In the short run, however,
and especially during the dark days of the Ruhr invasion, it was an asset:
the party—or rather governments known to depend on the support of the
party—had an entrée that would have been denied to others.
Fourth, there were the old contacts of the Social Democratic party with
the corresponding parties in other countries which dated from the Second
International. These contacts had not been completely severed by the war.
After all, the Second International had never been officially dissolved, and
many individuals and groups within it—especially, but by no means
exclusively, those of the neutral countries—had kept their internationalist
beliefs intact. The secretary (C. Huysmans) had continued to act, and in
From the First to the Second World War 357
1917, on the suggestion of the Scandinavian socialists, he had even made
an attempt to convene a congress which failed only because the Allied
powers, by that time determined to crush their adversary, refused to grant
passports. 8 Thus it was but natural that many socialists should have thought
of reviving it as a matter of course.
3. It was revived but not without difficulties. The first conferences that
were held for this purpose in 1919 and 1920 were only moderately
successful. The Communist (Third) International that had emerged
meanwhile (see below) exerted an attraction that proved a serious obstacle
to unity among the laborite and socialist parties of the world. And several
important groups that were in no mind to throw in their lot with the
communists still wanted something more up to date than the Second
International. This situation was met successfully by a clever tactical
device. On the initiative of the Austrian Socialists who were joined by the
German Independents and the English Independent Labor Party, a new
organization, the Workers’ International Union of Socialist Parties (the so-
called Vienna International), was formed in order to radicalize the groups
in the revived Second International, to restrain the groups that leaned too
much toward communism and to bring them both into line by judicious
formulations of aims. 9
The meaning of the venture is exactly rendered by the sobriquet the
communists immediately found for it, the “International number two and
one-half.” That is precisely why it was able to serve the needs of the time.
At the Congress of Hamburg (1923) the Second and the Vienna
Internationals were united in order to form the Labor and Socialist
International, to stigmatize the peace as “imperialist” and to call for a united
front against international reaction—which at any rate sounded well—for the
eight-hour day and for international social legislation. The reduction of
Germany’s indemnity to a definite and reasonable figure, the abolishment of
interallied debts and the evacuation of German territory had been declared
necessary a year before (Frankfort Resolutions, 1922). In the light of
subsequent events we cannot fail to realize how great an achievement—and
service—that was.
8 Before that there had actually been two conventions in Switzerland—at Zimmerwald
(1915) and at Kienthal (1916)—which acquired, contrary to the original intention I believe, a
different color owing to the fact that the attendance was not representative of the official parties.
I shall return briefly to them later on.
9 Some of those formulations would have done credit to any eighteenth-century diplomatist.
The great stumbling block was class war. The continental groups could not live without it, the
English could not live with it. So, when the merger was consummated at the Congress of
Hamburg, the Klassenkampf and the lutte des classes were retained in the German and French
texts but in the English text they were replaced by an unrecognizable circumlocution.

III. C OMMUNISM A ND T HE R USSIAN E LEMENT
1. Meanwhile, communist parties were rapidly developing. In itself this
is only what we should have expected. Nor was it dangerous. Any party
that experiences the sobering influence of responsibility will unavoidably
have to leave room for groups further to the left (or right) to develop in,
and such room is not likely to remain unoccupied for long. Provided
defection can be kept within bounds, this need not be more than a
nuisance—it may even be preferable to keeping unruly elements in the
fold. Socialist parties had always had trouble with hyper-radical wings. 10
That such “leftist” groups should gain ground in the troubled days that
followed upon the war and that they should seize the opportunity to
acquire the status of distinct parties is no more surprising than that they
should follow classical usage and call themselves “communist” or that
they should display a much stronger internationalist slant than the official
parties did at the time.
Bear in mind that all this is completely independent of the Russian aspect
of the case. There would be communist parties and there would be a
Communist International if the tsars still reigned over Russia. But since the
Russian element became a factor in shaping the fortunes of both socialism
and communism all over the world—in fact, in shaping the social and
political history of our time—it is essential to restate how it developed and
to appraise its nature and importance. For this purpose we shall divide its
development into three stages.
2. At first—that is to say, until the bolsheviks seized power in 1917—
there was nothing particularly Russian about the development of the
communist groups except that the strongest man happened to be a Russian
and that a streak of Mongol despotism was present in his scheme of
thought. When at the outbreak of the war the Second International
suspended itself via facti, and when Lenin declared that it was dead and
that the hour had struck for more effective methods, it was natural for those
who felt as he did to get together. Opportunity presented itself at the two
conventions that were held in Switzerland, at Zimmerwald (1915) and at
Kienthal (1916). Since practically all of those who had espoused the causes
of their nations stayed away, the attending militants found little difficulty
10 The splits that occurred in England and Germany over the war issue were of course
a different matter and of only temporary importance. Even the German Spartacus League,
founded in 1916 by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, though it went much further in
its opposition to war than the Independents approved, took time to develop a definitely
hostile attitude and even then did not go, officially at least, beyond insisting on the letter
of the old Erfurt program. So far as I know, neither Liebknecht nor Mrs. Luxemburg ever
completely severed contact with the party. The latter was one of the most relentless critics
of bolshevist practice.
From the First to the Second World War 359
in—more or less—rallying to Lenin’s program of converting the imperialist
war into an international revolution. There was more in this than a mere
profession of faith in pristine Marxism and its Messianic promise. There
was, with some of them, also the clear perception of the truth, to which
the bourgeois of all countries were so completely blind, that the fabric of
bourgeois society is unequal to the strains and stresses of prolonged “total”
warfare and that breakdowns would occur at least in some countries.
Beyond that however Lenin’s leadership was not accepted. Most of those
who were present thought of convincing, bullying and using existing
socialist parties rather than of destroying them. Moreover—and in this
Lenin agreed—the international revolution was to be brought about by the
individual actions of the national proletariats, and in the “advanced”
countries first.
The second stage I date from 1917 to 1927, that is to say, from the rise
of the bolsheviks to power in Russia to Trotsky’s expulsion from the Central
Committee of the Bolshevik party (October 1927). That decade witnessed
the emergence of communist parties and of a Communist (the “Third”)
International. It also witnessed the (for the time being) definitive break with
the socialist and laborite parties which, in the case of Germany, was
embittered beyond remedy by the severely repressive measures adopted by
the Social Democrats in power during the winter of 1918 to 1919. And
finally it witnessed the forging of the Russian chain.
But during the whole of that decade, the chain neither galled nor
distorted. It must be remembered that the bolshevik conquest of the rule
over the most backward of all the great nations was nothing but a fluke. 11
To a certain extent Lenin himself recognized this. He repeated over and
over again that final victory would be won only by the action of the
revolutionary forces in more advanced countries and that this action was
the really important thing. Of course he dictated to communists as he had
done before, and he insisted on a strictly centralist organization of the
Communist International—whose bureau took power to prescribe every
move of the individual parties—but he did so in his role of communist
leader and not in his role of Russian despot. That made all the difference.
The headquarters of the International were in Moscow, the actual leader
was Russian, but policy was directed in a thoroughly internationalist
spirit, without any particular reference to Russian national interests and
on principles with which the communists of all countries substantially
11 For this fluke, bolshevism was possibly indebted to the German general staff, by whose
orders Lenin was transported to Russia. If this should be thought an exaggeration of his personal
share in the events of 1917, there were enough other chance factors in the situation to teach us
the freakishness of this piece of history.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties360
agreed. Though the personal relation between the Bureau of the
International and the Political Bureau of the Soviet power 12 was then
much closer than it was later on, the two were nevertheless much more
nearly distinct agencies. Thus the International itself and the individual
parties did not behave differently than they would have behaved in the
absence of the link with Russia.
During that decade, therefore, the importance of the Russian
connection, though great, did not amount to more than this. First of all,
there was the weighty fact that however insignificant in quality and
quantity of membership a communist group might be and however little
claim to being taken seriously it might have, it could bask in the glory
reflected by that other group which had conquered an empire, and it
could derive encouragement from such a backing. Second, bolshevist
reality notwithstanding—the terror, the misery, the confession of failure
implied in the adoption of the New Economic Policy after the Kronstadt
revolt—it was henceforth possible to point to a socialist system that
“worked.” The bolsheviks proved themselves masters in the art of
exploiting the fact that public opinion in England and the United States
will swallow anything provided it is served up in the garb of familiar
slogans. This of course also redounded to the advantage of the other
communist parties. Third, so long as communists of all countries (Lenin
himself included) believed in the imminence of a world revolution, the
Russian army meant as much to them as the army of Tsar Nicholas I had
meant to the reactionary groups during the second quarter of the
nineteenth century. 13 In 1919 such hopes were less unreasonable and
nearer to fulfillment than people are now prepared to believe. It is true
that communist republics were actually established only in Bavaria and
in Hungary. 14 But in Germany, Austria and Italy the social structure was
perilously near toppling and there-is no saying what would have
12 In Lenin’s time, administrative authority was wielded by the Political Bureau, run by
Lenin himself, by the Military Council, Trotsky’s domain, and by the Cheka, then managed by
Dzerzhinsky. All three bodies were unknown to the constitution of the Soviet state, which vested
that authority in the “Soviet of the People’s Commissars.” Perhaps they should theoretically
be called organs of the party. But the party was the state.
13 It should be noticed that communists had dropped anti-militarism and noninterventionism
as easily as they had dropped democracy.
14 The Hungarian case (the government of Béla Kun) is highly instructive. The paralysis of
the upper classes and the indifference of the peasantry made it possible für a small group of
intellectuals to seize power without meeting significant resistance. They were a strange crowd—
some of them displaying (the same was true in Bavaria) unmistakably pathological symptoms—
and utterly unequal to this or any other serious task. But they had unbounded confidence in
themselves and their creed and no objection whatever to terrorist methods. And that proved quite
sufficient. They were allowed to stage their opera and might have gone on for an indefinite time
if the Allies had not permitted (or ordered) the Rumanian army to eject them.
From the First to the Second World War 361
happened in those countries and possibly farther west if Trotsky’s war
machine had been in working order at that time and not engaged in the
civil and the Polish wars. 15 It should not be forgotten that the Communist
International was founded in that atmosphere of impending life and death
struggle. Many things which acquired a different meaning afterwards—
such as the centralized management that has unlimited power over the
individual parties and deprives them of all freedom of action—may then
have seemed quite reasonable from that aspect.
The third stage I have dated from the expulsion of Trotsky (1927)
because this is a convenient landmark in the rise of Stalin to absolute
power. After that every actual decision in matters of policy seems to
have been his, though he still met some opposition in the Political
Bureau and elsewhere until the “trial” of Kamenew and Zinoviev (1936)
or even until Yezhov’s reign of terror (1937). For our purpose this
means that every decision was thenceforth the decision of a Russian
statesman acting on behalf of national Russian interests as seen from
the standpoint of a streamlined despotism. And this in turn, if correct,
defines what his attitude to the “Comintern” (the Communist
International) and to foreign communist parties must have been. They
became tools of Russian policy, taking rank within the huge arsenal of
such tools and being realistically evaluated relative to others according
to circumstances. Up to the present war which may revive it, the world
revolution was a frozen asset. The surviving veterans as well as the
neophytes of internationalist communism may have been contemptible.
But they were still of some use. They could preach the glories of the
Russian regime. They could serve as pins with which to prick hostile
governments. They increased the bargaining power of Russia. So it was
worth while to go to some trouble and expense in order to keep them
in subjection, to supervise them by agents of the secret police, and to
man the Comintern’s bureau with absolutely obsequious serfs who
would obey in fear and trembling.
3. In all this (and in lying about it) Stalin followed the established practice
of the ages. Most national governments have acted as he did and it is pure
hypocrisy to profess specific indignation in his case.
15 Therefore it is doubtful whether it is correct to say that the western powers acted foolishly
and inefficiently in supporting in a half-hearted way the various counterrevolutions that were
attempted in Russia, particularly the Denikin and Wrangel ventures. It seems to me that,
whether by a shrewd appraisal of the situation or by luck, they attained exactly what they could
have wished: they neutralized the Soviet power at a crucial moment and thus stopped the
advance of bolshevism. Less than this would have endangered their own social systems; more
than this would have involved prolonged, costly and perhaps unprofitable efforts that might
easily have defeated their aims.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties362
The most obvious examples are afforded by the practice of governments
who espoused a religious creed. As long as the respective creeds were
sufficiently vital to motivate action, these governments often used foreign
groups of the same creed for their purposes. But, as the history of the years
from 1793 to 1815 is sufficient to prove, the practice is much more general
than these examples suggest. No less standardized is the reaction—
phraseological and other—by the governments which are affected by it:
politicians of all types and classes are happy to seize the opportunity of
calling an opponent a traitor.
But for the communist parties outside of Russia it was a serious matter
to receive orders from a caput mortuum in the hands of a modernized tsar.
Their abject servility raises two questions, one as to its causes and another
as to its possible bearing on the future character and fate of revolutionary
socialism.
The first question is perhaps less difficult to answer than it seems. All we
have to do is to put ourselves in the communist’s chair and, taking account
of his type, look at his situation in a practical spirit. He would not object to
the Stalin regime on humanitarian considerations. He may even glory in the
slaughter—some neurasthenic degenerates do, and others, the communists
from failure and resentment, experience satisfaction at the sufferings of a
certain class of victims. Moreover, why should he resent cruelties that do not
prevent thoroughly bourgeois people from idolizing the regime? Why should
he, on that ground, condemn bolshevism when the Dean of Canterbury does
not? 16 Why indeed?
Again, there was hardly any reason for communists to object on the
ground of Thermidorism. This phrase was first used by the opponents of the
New Economic Policy but Trotsky adopted it later in order to stigmatize
Stalin’s regime as “reactionary” in the sense in which the action of the men
who overthrew Robespierre in 1794 was “reactionary.” But it is completely
meaningless. After all, it was Stalin who collectivized agriculture,
“liquidated” the Kulaks, reversed the New Economic Policy. In fact, like a
good tactician, he suppressed opposition and substantially carried out the
opposition’s program.
Finally, what the protecting power does at home is not of primary
importance to the communist in another country as long as that power
plays fair with him. And even if it does not play fair with him, what is
16 The sentiments expressed in the book by that ecclesiastic cannot be defended on the
ground that the principles of the “Russian experiment” are one thing and the mode of its
execution is another thing. For the really terrible point about the Stalin regime is not what it
did to millions of victims but the fact that it had to do it if it wished to survive. In other words,
those principles and that practice are inseparable.
From the First to the Second World War 363
he to do? The chain tightened and galled. But it also supported. The
socialist parties would not have accepted him. The normal healthy-
minded workman turned from him with a groan. He would have been at
loose ends like Trotsky. He was in no position to do without the chain, 17
and in accepting his slavery he may have hoped—he may still hope—that
junctures will arise in which he may be able to pull it his way…after the
present World War perhaps…
The last point goes some way toward answering the second question.
Certainly there is a possibility that Russian despotism will spread over the
ruins of European civilization—or even beyond them—and that in this case
the communist parties all over the world will be turned into Russian
garrisons. But there are many other possibilities. And one of them is that the
Russian regime will founder in the process or that in spreading over other
countries it will acquire traits more congenial to the individual national soils.
A special case of this kind would be that in the end the Russian element will
have changed nothing in the future character of revolutionary socialism. To
bank on this is no doubt risky. But it is not as foolish as it is to hope that
our civilization will emerge unscathed from the present conflagration—
unless of course this conflagration subsides more quickly than we have a
right to expect.
IV. A DMINISTERING C APITALISM ?
1. So far, then, we have not seen any convincing reason why the
experiments in political responsibility that socialist parties made after 1918
should not have been perfectly successful. To repeat: in some countries—
in Sweden for instance—socialists merely continued to consolidate a power
they had acquired before; in others, power had come naturally to them
without having to be conquered by revolutionary action; in all countries,
they seemed to be much more in a position to grapple with the great
problems of the time than was any other party. As I have put it before, they
almost seemed to monopolize the essential conditions for success.
Moreover, though most of them had not had any previous experience in
office, they had acquired plenty of experience of a most useful sort in
17 This of course particularly applies to the communist group or groups in the United States.
The conditions of American politics are not favorable to the growth of an official communist
party—a few county treasurerships do not go far from the recruiting standpoint. But the
importance of the communist element must not be measured by the membership of the official
party. Those intellectuals who are either straight communists or fellow travelers have really no
motive to join it. They have every motive to stay out of it, for they are much better able to
serve if, without carrying the badge, they conquer positions on opinion-producing committees
or in administrative bodies and so on, remaining free to deny, with perfect truth, that they are
communists in a party sense. Such invisible groups are incapable of concerted action except
for the lead from Moscow.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties364
organizing, negotiating and in administration. In fact, it should be stated
at once that they hardly ever did a downright foolish thing. Finally, neither
the inevitable emergence of a new party to the left of the socialists nor the
connection of that party with Moscow was as serious for them as their
opponents tried to make out.
But in spite of all this, their situation was everywhere precarious. To the
true believer it might well have seemed an impossible one. For all those
tactical advantages hid a fundamental difficulty which they were powerless
to remove. The war and the upheaval caused by the war had brought the
socialists into office; but below the tatters of the old garb, the social
organism, and in particular the economic process, were still what they had
been before. That is to say, socialists had to govern in an essentially
capitalist world.
Marx had visualized the conquest of political power as the prerequisite
of socialization which was to be taken in hand immediately. This implied,
however, as in fact Marx’s argument implied throughout, that the opportunity
for that conquest would occur when capitalism had run its course or, to use
our own phrase again, when things and souls were ripe. The breakdown he
thought of was to be a breakdown of the economic engine of capitalism from
internal causes. 18 Political breakdown of the bourgeois world was to be a
mere incident to this. But now the political breakdown—or something akin
to it—had happened, and the political opportunity had occurred, while the
economic process was nowhere near maturity as yet. The “superstructure”
had moved more quickly than the propelling mechanism. It was a most un-
Marxian situation.
The student in his closet may speculate about what the course of things
would have been if the socialist parties, recognizing the state of things, had
refused the Trojan horse of office, remained in the opposition and allowed
the bourgeoisie to deal with the wreckage left by the war and by the peace.
Perhaps it would have been better for them, for socialism, for the world—
who knows? But for men who by that time had learned to identify
themselves with their nations and to take the point of view of responsibility
there was no choice. They resolutely faced what fundamentally was an
insoluble problem.
There was a social and economic system that would not function except
on capitalist lines. The socialists might control it, regulate it in the interest
of labor, squeeze it to the point of impairing its efficiency—but they were
unable to do anything specifically socialist. If they were to run it, they would
have to run it according to its logic. They would have to “administer
18 This in part explains the favor enjoyed in the United States by theories which aim at
showing that capitalism is as a matter of fact breaking down from internal causes. See ch. x.
From the First to the Second World War 365
capitalism.” And this they did. Something was done to dress up their
measures in socialist phrases, and the magnifying glass was applied, with
some success, to every difference between their policy and what the
bourgeois alternative was in each case supposed to be. In substance however
they had to do what liberals or conservatives would also have done under
the same circumstances. But, though the only possible course, 19 this was, for
the socialist parties, a most dangerous one to pursue.
Not that it was entirely hopeless or, from the standpoint of the socialist
faith, entirely incapable of defense. At the beginning of the twenties,
socialists in Europe may well have hoped that, with luck and cautious
steering, they would establish themselves in or near the centers of
political power so as to be able to avert any danger of “reaction” and to
buttress the position of the proletariat until the day when it would be
possible to socialize society without any violent break; they would
preside over the euthanasia of bourgeois society and at the same time
make sure that the process of dying went on all right and that the victim
would not experience a comeback. But for the presence of other factors
than those which enter the socialist’s or the labor man’s picture of
society, this hope might have come true.
Defense from the standpoint of the Faith might have been based on the
proposition stated above, viz., that the situation was a novel one and had not
been foreseen by Marx. The bourgeois victim turning to the socialists for
shelter—such a case was evidently not provided for in his schema. It might
have been argued that under the circumstances even mere “administering
capitalism” was a great step in advance. Nor was it a question of
administering capitalism in the capitalist interest but of doing honest work
in the field of social reform, and of building a state that would pivot on the
workman’s interests. In any case that was the only thing to do if the
democratic road was to be chosen, for the immaturity of the situation
asserted itself precisely by the fact that there were no majorities to be had
for the socialist alternative. No wonder that the socialist parties which had
resolved to accept office under such circumstances loudly proclaimed their
allegiance to democracy!
Thus, the political hack’s craving for office was capable of justification
on the highest grounds of doctrine and proletarian interest. The reader will
have no difficulty in visualizing how such comfortable concordance must
have impressed radical critics. But since later events have induced so many
people to speak of the failure of that policy and to lecture the leaders of that

reconstruction on Russian lines. For it seems to me too obvious that any such attempt would
have speedily ended in chaos and counterrevolution.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties366
time on what they ought to have done, I do wish to emphasize both the
rationale of their views and the compelling nature of the pattern within which
they had to act. If failure there was, its causes must be looked for elsewhere
than in stupidity or treason. In order to convince ourselves of this we need
only glance at the English and German cases.
2. As soon as the orgy of nationalist sentiment that accompanied the close
of the war subsided, a genuinely revolutionary situation developed in
England, the temper of the masses asserting itself, for instance, by political
strikes. Responsible socialists and responsible laborites were so completely
driven together by these events—and by the danger of the nation’s being
goaded into a truly reactionary mood—that they henceforth accepted a
common leadership, at least as far as parliamentary maneuvering was
concerned. The lion’s share of the combined weight went to the labor interest
and, within the labor interest, to the bureaucracy of a few big unions so that
an opposition of disgruntled intellectuals developed almost at once. These
intellectuals objected to the laborite character of the alliance and professed
themselves unable to see anything socialist about it. The ideological
opportunism of the laborites lends some color to this view but, stressing the
facts of the situation rather than slogans, we shall nevertheless equate the
whole of the political labor forces, as far as they then accepted MacDonald’s
leadership, with the Social Democratic party of Germany.
Having successfully emerged from that revolutionary situation the party
steadily improved its position until MacDonald came into office in 1924. He
and his men made so creditable a showing that even malcontent intellectuals
were temporarily subdued. In matters of foreign and colonial policy, this
government was able to strike a note of its own—particularly with respect
to Russia. In domestic affairs, this was less easy to do, mainly because fiscal
radicalism had been (and continued to be) carried, quite as far as was
possible under the circumstances, by conservative governments dependent
upon a share in the labor vote. But while in legislation the labor government
did not go beyond comparative details, it proved itself qualified to administer
the nation’s affairs. Snowden’s excellent performance in the office of
chancellor of the exchequer would have sufficed to show to the nation and
to the world that labor was fit to govern. And this was in itself a service to
the cause of socialism. 20
Of course that success was greatly facilitated and any other kind of
success was rendered more difficult or even impossible by the fact that the
labor government was in a minority and had to rely not only on the
cooperation of the liberals—with whom they had much in common, for
20 Moreover, from the standpoint of party tactics, it made things much more difficult for
the conservatives than headstrong radicalism would have done.
From the First to the Second World War 367
instance their free-trade views—but also, to some extent, on the tolerance
of the conservatives. They were in much the same situation as the
conservatives were during their short spells of office in the 1850’s and
1860’s. It would not have been so easy for them to take a responsible attitude
if they had had a majority. But, as stated above, the very fact that they had
not should have proved even to a Marxist tribunal that the time had not yet
come for a stronger course of action—at all events, on any plan that would
answer democratic requirements.
The rank and file however did not appreciate all this. Still less did the
masses realize that they owed to the labor party not only what that party itself
accomplished but also part of what was being done for them by its
conservative competitor for the labor vote. They missed spectacular proposals
of reconstruction and promises of immediate benefits, and did not know how
unfair they were when they naïvely asked: “Why don’t the socialists do
something for us now they are in power?” The intellectuals who did not relish
being sidetracked naturally availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by
this mood in order to attack the sway of the laborites over the true socialists
and to work up current grievances into horrible wrongs callously neglected by
tyrannical trade-union bureaucrats. Under their influence the Independent
Labor party grew increasingly restive during the subsequent years of
opposition especially when MacDonald proved impervious to their arguments
for a more radical program.21 Thus, to many people, success looked much like
failure, and responsibility much like cowardice.
This was unavoidable however. The difficulties and dangers that are
inherent in a policy of socialist parties which involves accepting office under
conditions of “immaturity” are still better illustrated by the history of
MacDonald’s second ministry. 22 Historians have learned to do justice to the
21 That program primarily ran in terms of the socialization of banking and of certain key
industries and hence was not really on the lines of orthodox socialism. But under the
circumstances it was advertised as the genuine thing whereas MacDonald’s was styled
“reformist”—a term which according to classical usage applies equally well to the I.L.P.
program.
22 Readers may miss a comment on the general strike of 1926. Though it was to the interest
of both parties to the contest to minimize its symptomatic importance and though the official
theories of it have been shaped accordingly, it was much more than a series of tactical errors
issuing in a situation in which the trade-union congress had to “bluff” and the conservative
government had to “call the bluff.” We need only ask ourselves what the consequences of a
success would have been, for the authority of government and for democracy, in order to realize
that the strike was an historical event of the first order of importance. If that weapon had proved
effective, the trade unions would have become absolute masters of England and no other
political, judicial or economic power could have continued to exist beside them except on
sufferance. And in this position they could not have remained what they were. However
reluctantly, the leaders would have had to use the absolute power thrust upon them.
For our purpose, only two points need be noticed. First, the situation described above, in
particular the discontent that spread among the rank and file and was sedulously fostered by
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties368
statesmanship of Sir Robert Peel. 23 I trust that they will learn to do justice
to the statesmanship of MacDonald. He had the singular misfortune of
coming in at the very beginning of the world depression which, moreover,
was the immediate cause of the breakdown of the international system
embodied in the League of Nations.
Lesser men might have thought—lesser men did think, as a matter of
fact—that an opportunity had come for fundamental reconstruction. This
would have rent the nation in two and there cannot be any doubt about
what the result would have been. Short of fundamental reconstruction,
however, a policy of monetary expansion combined with less-than-
fundamental social reform—individual measures of nationalization for
instance and additional security legislation—and resort to mercantilist
policies in the field of international relations was being widely
recommended. But part of this program would undoubtedly have
intensified the depression, and the rest of it—abandonment of the gold
parity of the pound and mercantilism—meant so radical a break with the
national tradition and with the tradition of the labor party itself that the
socialists would hardly have been able to carry it, still less to make a
success of it; to carry it safely and effectively it had to be carried by
consent, that is to say, by a coalition.
So long as coalition was not possible, therefore, MacDonald and his men
applied themselves to the task of working the system as they found it. This,
under such conditions, was the most difficult of all the tasks they could have
undertaken. While everybody was clamoring that “something” must be done
at once, while irresponsibles of all types had the floor to themselves, while
the masses were grumbling, businessmen despairing, intellectuals ranting,
they steadily fought every inch of their ground. At home they kept order in
the finances, they supported the pound and they refrained from speeding up
the legislative machine. Abroad they strove with desperate energy—and
considerable success—to make the Geneva system work and to reduce
dangers and tensions all around. When the time had come and the national
interest seemed to warrant the party risk, they took the plunge and helped
the National Government into existence.
It is a melancholy reflection that, in many and important cases, a policy
many irresponsible elements, had much to do with the causation of the strike. Second, the strike
did not impair the power of the party-as it might have done. On the contrary, defeat seems to
have produced a radicalization of the masses which partly accounts for the party’s success in
1929.
23 The analogy extends from certain features of the political and economic situations that
confronted both men (although Peel had the advantage of entering upon office after the crisis
of 1836–1839) to matters of political detail. In both cases there was a party split, boldly risked
and eventually boldly accepted; in both cases the leaders were felt to be “traitors.”
From the First to the Second World War 369
is bound to be the more unpopular with the public and with the intellectual
critic the wiser it is. This is a case in point. To the radical critic who failed
to link up that policy with the comparative mildness of the depression in
England and with the steadiness of the subsequent recovery, there was
nothing in it except weakness, incompetence, hidebound traditionalism, if
not traitorous abandonment of the socialist cause. What probably was one
of the best performances in the history of democratic politics and one of
the best examples of action responsibly decided on from a correct
perception of an economic and social situation, the critic looked upon with
“shame and disgust.” At best he considered MacDonald simply as a bad
jockey who had brought the horse to its knees. But the hypothesis that
appealed to him most was that the MacDonald government yielded to the
diabolical whisperings (or worse) of English bankers or to the pressure of
their American backers.
Unfortunately, such nonsense is a factor of real importance and must
be taken account of in any attempt at prognosis. It may seriously interfere
with the ability of socialist parties to serve the cause of civilization
during the transitional age in which we live. But if we discard this
element and also the truism that any party which makes a sacrifice in the
national interest will suffer for it in the short run, we shall have little
difficulty in recognizing that in the long run the labor influence may well
turn out to have been strengthened by MacDonald’s second tenure of
office. Again the analogy with Sir Robert Peel’s second ministry will help
to illustrate this. Peel’s conservative majority split on the issue of the
repeal of the corn laws. The Peelite wing, though much more numerous
and important than MacDonald’s personal following, soon disintegrated.
The conservative party was maimed and proved unable to get into
power—though it got three times into office—until Disraeli’s great
victory in 1873. But after that and until Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman’s victory in 1905, it held power for about two-thirds of the
time. More important than this, the English aristocracy and gentry,
politically speaking, held their own all the time much better than they
would have done if the stigma of dear bread had not been removed.
As a matter of fact, the labor party quickly recovered and consolidated
its position in the country during the years that followed upon the split.
It is safe to say that even in the normal course of things—irrespective of
the war, that is—the socialists would have again come into office before
long, with increased power and better chances of success, and that they
would have been able to take a stronger line than they had taken
previously. But it is equally safe to say that both as to their program and
as to their ability to give effect to it, their policy would have differed only
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties370
in degree from the MacDonald policy—principally by some individual
measures of socialization.
3. The postwar career of the German Social Democratic party of course
differs from that of the English labor party in many particulars. But as soon
as the German socialists who stayed in the Social Democratic party had
accepted office and made up their minds to fight communism they were just
as much committed to “administer capitalism” as were their English
colleagues. If we grant these premises and take account of the fact that they
did not have, and could not expect to have in the calculable future, a majority
either in the federal parliament or in the Prussian diet or in the population,
everything else follows with inexorable logic. In 1925 the total population was
about 62 millions. The proletariat (laborers and their families; I include the
domestic servants) numbered not quite 28 millions and part of the vote of this
class went to other parties. The “independent” population was not much
smaller—about 24 millions—and largely impervious to the socialist
persuasion. Even if we exclude an upper stratum—say one million—and
confine ourselves to the groups that count at the polls—the peasants, artisans,
retailers—there was not much to be conquered there, not only for the moment
but even for the near future. Between these two groups there were the white-
collar employees, no less than 10 millions of them including their families. The
Social Democratic party of course realized that this class held the key position,
and made great efforts to conquer it. But in spite of considerable success, these
efforts only served to show that the white collar is a much more serious barrier
than it should be according to the Marxian theory of social classes.24
Thus, even if the communists had been the allies of the Social Democrats
instead of being their bitterest enemies, the party would still have been in
the minority. It is true that the non-socialist majority was not actively hostile
in all its sections: the left-wing liberals (the Democratic People’s party),
stronger in talent than in numbers, were always ready for cooperation (up
to a point). It is also true that this majority was split up into many groups
which were quite incapable of acting in unison and whose members and
supporters were not anything like as disciplined as were the Social
Democrats themselves. But sensible people who were neither able nor
24 When confronted with this fact socialists usually derive comfort from the arguments
that non-socialist employees are just erring sheep who have not yet found their true political
location but who are sure to find it eventually, or that they are prevented from joining the
party by the ruthless pressure exerted by their employers. The first argument will not carry
conviction to anyone beyond the Marxian fold—we have seen that the theory of social classes
is one of the weakest links in the Marxian chain. The second argument is false as a matter
of plain fact. Whatever truth it may have contained at other times, the German employers of
the twenties were, save exceptions without quantitative importance, in no position to influence
the vote of their employees.
From the First to the Second World War 371
willing to embark upon hazardous courses would nevertheless feel that there
was for them but one line to take—the line of democracy—and that this line
spelled coalition.
The party that best qualified for the role of an ally was the Catholic party
(the Center). It was powerful. Before the advent of Hitler it seemed that
nothing could shake the loyalty of its supporters. Its organization was
excellent. Provided the interests of the church were safeguarded, it was
prepared to go nearly as far in social reform of the immediately practical
kind as were the socialists themselves, in some respects even further. Not
harboring any particularly fervent feelings for the displaced dynasties, it
stood squarely behind the Weimar constitution. Last but not least, it
welcomed spoils-sharing arrangements that would guarantee its preserves.
Thus understanding came about with what to the foreign observer might
seem surprising ease. The socialists treated the Catholic Church with the
utmost deference and tact. They made no difficulties about a concordat with
the pope that gave the clergy more than it ever had had under the heretic
Hohenzollerns. As to policies, there were hardly any dissensions at all.
But although this alliance was fundamental, no party that professed
allegiance to the Weimar constitution was excluded from office. Democrats,
National Liberals, Nationals (=Conservatives) were all of them admitted,
even to positions of high command. Coalition as a universal principle meant
compromise as a universal principle. The necessary concessions as to
measures were in fact readily made. The army was left alone, practically
under management of its own choosing, and adequately provided with
means. Eastern Prussia was subsidized and agriculture in general was the
object of solicitous care. Some implications of this which might not quite
tally with socialist professions were made more palatable to the proletariat
that paid the bill by calling this sort of thing Planning—perhaps the reader
feels that there is nothing new under the sun.
In its attitude toward the industrial masses and toward its own program
the Social Democratic party laborized itself. At the beginning a token
payment was made by the passing of a very moderate bill of which the most
radical feature consisted in the word Socialization that was inserted in its title
(1919). But the socialists soon shelved all this in order to apply themselves
to labor legislation of the kind made familiar to Americans by the New Deal.
This satisfied the trade unions whose bureaucracy was increasingly allowed
to form the operative section of the party’s policy-making machine.
This, so one might think, should have been difficult for a party with a
Marxian tradition that continued to prevail in the party schools. But it was not.
Except for a certain amount of communist defection, the intellectuals from
whom opposition within the party could have been expected to arise were kept
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties372
well in hand. Unlike the English party, the German one had settled down in
the administrative apparatus of the Reich, the states and the municipalities.
Moreover, it had, in its press and elsewhere, many jobs of its own to offer. This
patronage was energetically used. Obedience spelled preferment in the civil
service, in the academic career, in the numerous public enterprises and so on.
These means were effective in bringing radicals to heel.
The firm hold the Social Democrats acquired on all the parts of the
machinery of public administration not only made for stricter discipline but
also helped to increase membership and, beyond membership, the vote on
which the party was able to count. Of course it also increased its power in
other ways. For instance, the socialists secured dominant power in the
Prussian Free State. This gave them control of the police force and they
were careful to choose party members or reliable careerists for police
presidents (chiefs of police) in the big towns. Thus they buttressed their
camp until their position seemed impregnable according to all ordinary
standards. And, again according to all ordinary rules of political analysis,
even an orthodox Marxist could have comforted himself by arguing that
in those trenches they could quite comfortably dwell till things in their
secular course would of themselves change minority into majority and
draw the curtains that veiled the Ultimate Goal for the time being.
Quotation from the Communist Manifesto…
Irrespective of the mechanics of the party’s power plant, the political
setup as well as the general social situation looked eminently stable.
Moreover, whatever might be urged against many individual measures,
legislative and administrative, on the whole the coalition’s policies made for
and not against stability. Much that was done must command our sincere
respect. Nothing that was done qualifies for explanation of anything worse
than the ordinary measure of discontent that every regime elicits which lacks
authority and glamour. The only possible exception to this lies in the
financial sphere. Part of the cultural and political achievements of this
governmental system was associated with large and rapidly increasing public
expenditure. Furthermore, this expenditure was financed by methods—
though a highly successful sales tax was among them—which drained the
sources of accumulation. So long as the inflow of foreign capital continued,
all went comparatively well, although budgetary and even cash difficulties
began to appear more than a year before it ceased. When it did cease, that
well-known situation emerged which would have undermined the position
of the most magnetic of leaders. All in all, however, the socialist critics of
the party and its conduct during this spell of power will be entitled to boast
of no mean achievement if, in case they were ever installed in office, they
should do equally well
From the First to the Second World War 373
V. T HE P RESENT W AR A ND T HE F UTURE O F S OCIALIST P ARTIES
How the present war will affect the fortunes of existing socialist groups of
course depends on its duration and outcome. For our purpose, I do not see
any point in speculating about this. Let us however, by way of example,
consider two cases out of a great many possible ones.
Even now (July 1942) many observers seem to expect that Russia will
emerge from the war with a great access of power and prestige, in fact that
Stalin will emerge as the true victor. If this should be so, it does not
necessarily follow that a communist world revolution will be the
consequence or even that there will be “Russification” of continental Europe
accompanied by an extermination of the upper strata and a settlement of
accounts with non-communist socialist (and Trotskyite) groups. For even
barring a possible Anglo-American resistance to the expansion of Russian
power, it is not certain that the self-interest of Russian autocracy will lie in
that direction. But it is certain that the chances for such a consummation—
realization of the full Lenin program—would be immeasurably increased.
However this world revolution might differ from the Marxian idea, it would
for those who are willing to accept it as a substitute doubtless cease to be a
daydream. And not only as regards Europe.
In that case the fate of orthodox socialism and all it stands for would
be sealed. And so it would be, on the continent of Europe, in case the
fascist powers hold their own. If however we again assume complete
victory of the Anglo-American-Russian alliance—that is to say, a victory
that enforces unconditional surrender but with all the honors held by
England and the United States—then we see readily that orthodox
socialism of the German Social Democratic or of a still more laborite type
stands a much better chance to survive on the continent of Europe, at all
events for some time. One reason for believing this is that people, if they
find both the bolshevist and the fascist routes barred, may well turn to the
Social Democratic republic as the most obvious of the remaining choices.
But there is a much more important reason: laborite socialism will enjoy
the favor of the victors. For the consequence of so complete a victory as
we now envisage will be Anglo-American management of the affairs of the
world—a kind of Anglo-American rule which, from the ideas we see taking
shape under our eyes, may be termed Ethical Imperialism. A world order
of this kind in which the interests and ambitions of other nations would
count only as far as understood and approved by England and the United
States can be established only by military force and upheld only by
permanent readiness to use military force. It is perhaps unnecessary to
explain why, in the political and economic conditions of our time, this
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties374
would mean for these two countries a social organization that is best
described as Militarist Socialism. But it is clear that the task of controlling
and policing the world would be much facilitated, on the one hand, by the
re-creation and new creation of small and inefficient states in Europe and,
on the other hand, by installing governments of the laborite or Social
Democratic types. Especially in Germany and Italy, the debris of the Social
Democratic parties would constitute the only political material from which
to construct governments which could possibly accept this world order for
longer than a period of prostration and cooperate with the agents of the
world protectorate without mental reservations. Whatever it may be worth,
this is the chance of Liberal Socialism.
From the standpoint of the subject of this book however (though from no
other) all this is of secondary importance. Whatever the fate of particular
socialist groups, there cannot be any doubt that the present conflagration
will—inevitably, everywhere, and independently of the outcome of the war—
mean another great stride toward the socialist order. An appeal to our
experience of the effects of the First World War on the social fabric of
Europe suffices to establish this prognosis. This time however the stride will
be taken also in the United States.
But that experience, though a valuable guide, is an inadequate one. A
quarter of a century has elapsed. This is no negligible span even as regards
the secular forces that make for socialism in the sense explained in Part II.
Independently of everything else we shall be confronted at the end of this war
with an economic situation, a social atmosphere, a distribution of political
power substantially different from those of 1918. Much however has happened
during these twentyfive years that could not have been predicted from secular
tendencies alone. Among other things there was the great depression which,
impinging upon a delicate situation, shook social structures to their
foundations, nowhere more than in this country. Still more effective in
undermining these structures were the policies by which that depression was
handled. And this must be attributed largely to political configurations that
were in part accidental. The consequences are obvious. In particular, huge
bureaucracies have developed that by now are powerful enough to hold their
ground and to implement policies of fundamental reconstruction.
In no country will war taxation of business and of the business class be
reduced in the proportion in which it was reduced after 1919. This may in
itself suffice to paralyze the motors of capitalism for good and thus provide
another argument for government management. Inflation, even if it should
go no further than is, for instance in this country, unavoidable in the present
political pattern, may well do the rest, both directly and, through the
radicalization of the expropriated holders of bonds and insurance policies,
From the First to the Second World War 375
indirectly. Moreover, nowhere will war controls be liquidated to the extent
the experience of the years after 1918 might lead us to believe. They will
be put to other uses. In this country steps are already being taken to prepare
public opinion for governmental management of postwar adjustments and to
put the bourgeois alternative out of court. Finally, there is no reason to
believe that governments will ever relax the hold they have gained on the
capital market and the investment process. To be sure, this does not sum up
to socialism. But socialism may, under such conditions, impose itself as the
only practicable alternative to deadlocks and incessant friction.
Details and phrases will of course differ in different countries. So will
political tactics and economic results. English developments are comparatively
easy to foresee. The labor men entered the Churchill government in response
to the call of emergency. But, as has been pointed out before, they were then
well advanced on the road to office and power irrespective of any emergency.
Therefore they will quite naturally be in a position to manage postwar
reconstruction alone or—which may prove to be the most effective method—
in a coalition they would control. The war economy will have realized some
of their immediate aims. To a considerable extent they will only have to keep
what they have got already. Further advance toward the socialist goal can be
expected to be relatively easy in conditions in which there is not much left
for capitalists to fight for. And it may prove possible to be quite frank about
it and to carry out socialization soberly, in an orderly way, and largely by
consent. For many reasons, but principally because of the weakness of the
official socialist party, prognosis is less easy in the case of this country. But
ultimate results are not likely to be different, though slogans are almost sure
to be—and costs in terms of both welfare and cultural values.
Once more: it is only socialism in the sense defined in this book that is
so predictable. Nothing else is. In particular there is little reason to believe
that this socialism will mean the advent of the civilization of which orthodox
socialists dream. It is much more likely to present fascist features. That
would be a strange answer to Marx’s prayer. But history sometimes indulges
in jokes of questionable taste.

CHAPTER XXVIII
THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE SECOND
WORLD WAR
Mundus regitur parva sapientia
A LITTLE more can now (July, 1946) be added to what was said in the
last section about the effects of the war on the social structure of our
epoch and on the position and prospects of orthodox (i.e. non-Communist)
socialist groups. It was obvious in July, 1942, that, whatever the fate of
particular socialist groups, there would be another great stride toward the
socialist order, and that this time the stride would be taken also in the United
States. It was also clear that the fortunes of existing socialist groups would
depend on the duration and outcome of the war. It was finally suggested that,
in the event of a complete victory (implying unconditional surrender for the
enemy) of the Anglo-American-Russian alliance, the results for orthodox
socialism would differ according to whether Stalin emerged as the true victor
or whether all the honors were held by England and the United States. In
the latter eventuality orthodox socialism of the German Social Democratic
type or laborism of the English type would stand a good chance to improve
their position on the continent of Europe.
Stalin has emerged master of eastern Europe. England and the United
States are struggling to maintain some influence in central and western
Europe. The fortunes of socialist and communist parties reflect these
conditions. But there is another element that may substantially affect
the social situation all over the world, namely, economic developments
in the United States which may possibly tell in favor of the capitalist
order. This chapter will therefore deal, first, with the position of
orthodox socialism and laborism and in particular with the English
situation; second, with the possible effects of conspicuous industrial
success in the United States; third, with the possible effects of Russia’s
political success. Our argument thus divides up naturally into three
parts, namely
I England and Orthodox Socialism
II Economic Possibilities in the United States
III Russian Imperialism and Communism
The Consequences of the Second World War 377
I
E NGLAND AND O RTHODOX S OCIALISM
Many facts go to show that, irrespective of the Russian element in the case,
the effects of the Second World War on the social situation in Europe would
have been similar to those of the First World War, only stronger. That is to
say, we should have witnessed acceleration of the existing trend toward a
socialist organization of production in the sense defined in this book.
The most important of those facts is the success of the English Labour
party. As has been pointed out in the last chapter, this success was to be
expected and should not have surprised anybody. Nor was it more complete
than we should have expected. Owing to the English electoral system, the
actual redistribution of seats is apt to give an exaggerated picture. There
were about twelve million labor votes against about ten million
conservative votes. The days of liberalism are over, of course, but even the
surviving dozen of liberal members represent more votes than do seventy-
two Labour members taken at random. In other words, under a system of
proportional representation, the Labour party would not have gained a
parliamentary majority over Conservatives and Liberals combined though
a Labour-Liberal coalition would have enjoyed a comfortable margin. The
very rationale of the English electoral system is to produce strong
governments and to avoid deadlocks. This is what it has done in this case.
But the national situation as distinguished from the parliamentary one is,
nevertheless, not a matter of indifference for an estimate of what is and
what is not, politically possible. The obvious inference is strengthened by
the fact that the groups to the left of the official Labour party failed
conspicuously to improve their parliamentary position: the Independent
Labour party just retained its three seats and the Commonwealth plus the
Communist parties lost one of the four they previously held. In view of
the many reasons there were to expect “radicalization,” this is truly
remarkable and a striking proof of England’s political maturity.
This situation is bound to assert itself. In fact it has done so already,
both in the complexion of the Cabinet and in the measures taken or
foreshadowed. The reader is asked to read again what has been written in
this book under the heading of Socialist Policy before the Act (Chapter
XIX, section IV). He will observe, first, that all the Labor government
does, or is proposing to do, is in the spirit and on the principles of the
program there outlined; and, second, that actual practice does not go nearly
as far. The nationalization of the Bank of England, in particular, is a highly
significant symbol and may therefore stand out as a historical landmark.
But its practical importance may well be equated to zero: the bank has been
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties378
practically a department of the Treasury ever since 1914 and under modern
conditions no central bank can be anything else. And such things as the
coal measure or full-employment legislation are hardly controversial any
more—in England. The way in which the Labor government deals or is
likely to deal with them will presumably command all but universal
consent. Tournaments on questions of fundamental principle will no doubt
enliven the serious work; but not because these questions or the differences
about them are so very important but because governments and parliaments
cannot live without them. All this is as it should be. No doubt it is once
more a case of administering capitalism but, both because of the war and
the lapse of time, this will be done with clearer purpose and a firmer hand
than before and with ultimate liquidation of private enterprise more clearly
in view. Three points deserve, however, particular attention.
First, it is precisely this almost ideal conformity of political action to the
data of the social and economic situation which is so important and, from
the standpoint of private-property society, so dangerous. Whatever
intellectual extremists might say—and, of course, the attitude of the Labour
government makes business for them—the stride toward a socialist England
will be the more substantial because there is so little nonsense about it. Steps
so responsibly taken will not have to be retraced. Barring upsets from
outside, social, political and economic disaster may be successfully avoided.
If the government succeeds in keeping to its line, it will fulfill exactly the
task that lies between the tasks of laborite governments without power (such
as McDonald’s were, see above Chapter XXVII, section IV) and the tasks
of laborite governments of the future whose parliamentary majority will be
paralleled by a majority of the electorate. This is the only hope for
democratic socialism. Such hope as there is for it on the continent of Europe
is, of course, somewhat strengthened by the English paradigma.
Second, we have noticed in the preceding chapter that the earlier socialist
thinkers never foresaw, and could not have been expected to foresee, a situation
in which political power would be thrust upon labor and in which the bourgeois
victim would turn to it for protection. We have also noticed another thing they
did not and could not foresee, namely, the extent to which it would prove
possible to expropriate the bourgeois structure, without formally destroying the
legal framework of the capitalist order and by such unrevolutionary methods as
taxation and wage policies. War taxation and war controls certainly cannot be
fully maintained. But retreat from them may be brought to a halt at a line at
which some of the most popular items of the socialist program are automatically
fulfilled. Equalization of incomes after taxes is already carried so far as to impair
the efficiency, to use the Russian phrase, of “specialists” such as physicians or
engineers. This is indeed done by means of a clumsy and costly apparatus and
The Consequences of the Second World War 379
it may before long occur to people that it might be better to limit incomes paid
out to what direct taxes leave of them instead of paying out what has to be
recovered again. In any case, however, the orange to be squeezed, and with it
much radical rhetoric, is apt to run dry.
Third, suppose that in the next election labor improves upon its present
position and gains the support of a substantial majority of the electorate,
what is the government to do? They may go a little further in the direction
of equalizing incomes; they may improve social services, on Beveridge-Plan
and other lines, a little beyond what any government would do; they may
go considerably further in socializing industries. But none of this will be easy
going. We have seen that, in the conditions of modern England, there is little
purely economic objection to a large measure of socialization. Nor is
bourgeois resistance likely to prove a serious obstacle; England depends on
her industrialists’ work much more than did Russia in 1917, but unless they
are unnecessarily antagonized their co-operation may be secured. Nor,
finally, need we attach much importance to the argument that appeals so
much to more ardent votaries of socialization, viz., that the cabinet system
is not adequate to the task of carrying socialization: intellectuals who delight
in the vision of dictatorial methods may indeed doubt its efficiency; but it
is the only system that is available for carrying socialization
democratically—the actual administration of the socialized industries will of
course require semi-autonomous organs with which cabinets would have to
co-operate as they do, say, with the general staff, of their armies. But the
real problem is labor. Unless socialization is to spell economic breakdown,
a socializing government cannot possibly tolerate present trade-union
practice. The most irresponsible of politicians would, in the case envisaged,
have to face the basic problem of modern society that only Russia has
solved, the problem of industrial discipline. A government that means to
socialize to any great extent, will have to socialize trade unions. And, as
things actually are, labor is of all things the most difficult to socialize. Not
that the problem is insoluble. In England, the chances for successful solution
by the political method of democracy are greater than they are anywhere
else. But the road to solution may be tortuous and long.
Except for the Russian element, the political situation on the continent of
Europe is essentially similar. Where there is a free choice, we observe a strong
tendency for the masses to keep or revert to their allegiance to either social-
democratic or else to Catholic parties. The most obvious instances are the
Scandinavian countries. But a similar trend may be discerned even in Germany,
and it is safe to assert that if she were free and uninfluenced, something very
like the Weimar Republic would emerge from all the present misery. Though
the evidence to this effect is in part invalidated by the favor shown to the Social
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties380
Democrats by the English and American authorities, it is strengthened by the
fact that the Russian authority also permitted reconstruction of a Social
Democratic organization in its zone. Impossible political and economic
conditions, irrationally imposed upon the German people, will of course discredit
the laborite governments and annihilate their chances, such as they are, of
establishing themselves. But still, if for the sake of a mental experiment we
choose to neglect the Russian element of the case and if we further choose to
postulate that the United States and England act toward Germany in the manner
dictated alike by common decency and common sense, this would be the general
diagnosis and prognosis to adopt. A similar prognosis suggests itself for other
countries though with various qualifications: laborite régimes—in Catholic
countries more often than not in coalition with Catholic parties—with home-
grown and not too important communist groups to the left of them and a policy
more advanced than was that of the twenty’s but still on the same lines, with all
this implies, economically, politically and culturally. The little example of Austria
is instructive. The Christian Socialists (Catholic party, comprising the
conservative elements) came off well, the Communists did badly, the Social
Democrats just about regained their old position, with most of their surviving
old leaders well entrenched in the party’s high command. Even programs have
not greatly changed so far as general principles are concerned. The recent move
toward socialization has not been made from choice. The cases of the other small
countries so far as independent of Russia come within the same type and so does
that of Italy. The French case differs from this type owing to the strength of the
Communists (see below, section III). And only our inability to understand any
pattern except our own prevents us from realizing that the Spanish case is really
the most unproblematical of all.1

ECONOMIC P OSSIBILITIES IN THE U NITED S TATES

2. The Great Possibility
3. Conditions for Its Realization
4. Transitional Problems
5. The Stagnationist Thesis
6. Conclusion
1 The Franco régime simply reproduces an institutional pattern that, from necessities that
should be easy to understand, became well established in nineteenth-century Spain. Franco did
and does what had been done before him by Narvaez, O’Donnell, Espartero, Serrano. The fact
that unfortunate Spain has become at present the football in the game of international power
politics in which she has no stake herself, is responsible for a propaganda that obscures a very
simple state of things

1. When discussing the English case, we have noticed that under modern
conditions—to an extent undreamed of by nineteenth-century socialists—it
is possible to extract from the bourgeois stratum, by taxation and wage
policies, the bulk of what in Marxist terminology is called Surplus Value. 2
The same observation applies to the United States. To an extent which is not
generally appreciated, the New Deal was able to expropriate the upper
income brackets even before the war. One indication will have to suffice, one
that shows no more than the effects of the increase in the (personal) Income
and Surtax and these only up to 1936: in 1929, when Total Income Paid Out
was estimated at 80.6 billion dollars, the brackets above $50,000 (taxable
income) retained 5.2 billions after income and surtax; in 1936, when the total
of income paid out was estimated at 64.2 billion dollars, not quite 1.2
billions. 3 Taxable income above $100,000 was even then wholly absorbed if
account be taken of estate taxes. From the standpoint of naïve radicalism,
the only trouble with these and subsequent measures of confiscation is that
they did not go far enough. But this does not alter the fact with which we
are concerned for the moment, viz., that irrespective of the war, a tremendous
transfer of wealth has actually been effected, a transfer that quantitatively is
comparable with that effected by Lenin. The present distribution of
disposable incomes compares well with the one actually prevailing in Russia,
particularly in view of the further fact that owing to the greater importance
in the upper-bracket budgets of personal services and of commodities that
contain relatively much labor, the purchasing power of the upperbracket
dollar has in the United States fallen much more than has that of the lower-
bracket dollar. 4 Moreover, we may also repeat another observation made
2 The reader will, of course, observe that the proposition asserts nothing about the effects
of such a policy upon the size—and long-run rate of increase—of the national income. In
particular, it does not exclude the possibility that labor might receive less real income, in total
amount and in the long run, if incomes were completely equalized than it would receive if the
whole of the Marxist surplus value accrued to the “capitalist” stratum.
3 See the highly instructive article by I. de Vegh on Savings, Investment, and Consumption,
American Economic Review (Papers and Proceedings of the 53d Annual Meeting, February, 1941,
pp. 237 et seq.). As there explained, the data from which the sums retained were calculated
exclude income from wholly tax-exempt government securities and include capital gains.
Moreover, these sums are, of course, not strictly comparable with the figures of total income paid
out (Commerce estimates), which may, however, be considered as indices of the comparable
figures. The reason why I have not simply taken the latter (from Statistics of Income) is obvious,
but the choice of the years of comparison needs explanation: 1929 was the year for which incomes
above $50,000 after income and surtax were at an absolute maximum; 1936 has been chosen
because it was the last year that was, first, unaffected by the recession of 1937–1938 and, second,
completely free from war influences that asserted themselves from 1939 on.
4 Comparison between different countries is of course difficult and perhaps never quite
convincing. But the Russian act of April 4, 1940, concerning the income tax, reveals that
incomes as low as 1.812 rubles per year were subject to it. It also reveals the existence of
incomes of over 300,000 rubles which were then taxed at the rate of 50 per cent. Now, let us
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties382
earlier concerning England. The pressure on the upper brackets is, of course,
not confined to “$50,000 and above.” To a diminishing degree it extends
down to the incomes of $5,000. And there cannot, be any doubt, especially
in the case of doctors in the middle ranges of professional success, that this
sometimes results in loss of much-needed efficiency.
So far, then, the effect upon the social structure of the war plus the
labor troubles that were its natural consequence would seem to be much
the same as in England. The fact that in the United States there is no
well-organized national labor party might set us speculating about the
possibility of a development on the lines of guild socialism instead of one
toward centralist socialism. Otherwise this fact only strengthens the case
for the prognosis that has been elaborated in this book, for pressure
groups are just as powerful as parties and much less responsible, hence
more effective battering rams.

2. But there is another fact about the social situation in the United States
that has no analogue anywhere else in the world and may conceivably affect
our diagnosis concerning the chances of the privateenterprise system, at least
for a short run of fifty years or so, namely, the colossal industrial success
we are witnessing. Some observers seem to think that this success which has
won the war and, in addition, has protected American labor from privation,
will dominate the postwar situation also, to an extent that may annihilate the
whole case for socialism so far as it is of a purely economic nature. Let us
put this argument into its most optimistic form.

Neglecting for the moment the complex of transitional problems and
neglect the tax on the lowest incomes entirely and put the modal income in the 1,812–2,400
ruble group at 2,000 rubles; further, let us put the modal retained income in the highest group
at no higher than 150,000 rubles (though those 300,000 rubles before tax were a lower limit).
Then we discover that the higher of these modes was 75 times the lower one. Even if we put,
for 1940, the American equivalent (not of course in purchasing power, but in the sense of
equivalent position in the income scale) of the lower mode at as low as $1,000, we shall
evidently not find much in the United States income distribution of retained incomes (even apart
from the reductions specifically motivated by the requirements of war finance) to support, in
the light of the Russian paradigma, the current phrases about atrocious inequalities,
“concentration of power” as measured by concentration of income, and the like. The evidence
presented in the well-known book by Bienstock, Schwarz and Yugov on Industrial Management
in Russia tends to support this view. Many other details point in the same direction, for instance,
the fact that those ranges of the professions who could formerly but cannot now afford domestic
servants in the United States, do enjoy this privilege—worth a ton of electrical household
gadgets—in Russia. All this still fails to take account of advantages that do not pass through
income accounts. The power and social position—which is one of the main reasons for valuing
a high income—of the industrial manager, especially if leader of the local unit of the Bolshevik
party, is far and away above that of an American industrialist.
Interesting phenomenon—this Lag of Ideas! Many well-meaning people in this country now
profess horror or indignation at social inequalities which did exist fifty years ago, but no longer
do. Things change, slogans remain.

fixing upon 1950 as the first “normal” year—a practice quite common with
forecasters—we will put the Gross National Product—value of all goods and
services produced before allowance for depreciation and depletion—
evaluated by means of the B.L.S. pricelevel index for 1928, hypothetically
at two hundred billions. This is, of course, not a prediction of the actual
volume of production to be expected in that year. It is not even an estimate
of what potential production at high if not “full” employment will be. It is
an estimate of what this potential production might be provided certain
conditions are fulfilled which will be stated presently. As such, it is high but
neither unusual—higher figures have been mentioned—nor unreasonable. It
conforms to past experience of the long-run average performance of the
system: if we apply our “normal rate of growth of 3.7 per cent per year” (see
above Chapter V) to the 1928 gross national product figure, which was about
ninety billions, we get a little under two hundred billions for 1950. No undue
importance should be attached to this. But I will nevertheless repeat that an
objection to the effect that this extrapolation is meaningless because output
failed to increase at that rate in the thirties would miss the point and only
prove the objector’s inability to grasp it. However, so far as potential
production is concerned, the indications afforded by the system’s actual
performance during the war are certainly more convincing: if war statistics
are anything to go by, the gross national product, reduced to the 1928 price
level, was in 1943 pretty much what it should have been in order to reach
the two hundred billion goal by 1950.

Now suppose that this possibility be actually realized.5 And let us, for
5 It is assumed that realization of this possibility involves a forty-hour week plus overtime
at bottlenecks. But full employment is not assumed. Definitions of full employment and
estimates of the amount of employment that satisfies any given definition vary widely and
involve not only statistical but also some rather delicate theoretical issues. I must rest content
to state that, in the conditions of the United States labor market and assuming that the total
labor force will be something like sixty one millions in 1950 (counting in two or three millions
in the armed forces), I do not see that the number of statistically unemployed women and men
can possibly be, in that year, below five to six millions, a figure which includes, besides
genuinely involuntary unemployment (i.e., involuntary unemployment that would be involuntary
unemployment according to any definition), a large allowance for semiinvoluntary
unemployment and merely statistical unemployment. The figure does not include “hidden”
unemployment. I believe it to be compatible with the two hundred billion goal for that year. It
has little to do with vices specific to the capitalist system, but much with the freedom capitalist
society grants to labor. Even in Sir William Beveridge’s book on full employment there are
chastely veiled hints at direction and compulsion. It should be added, however, that I visualize
1950 as a year of cyclical prosperity. If it is not, then our discussion should be understood to
refer to the prosperous year next to it. On an average of good and bad years (statistical)
unemployment should be higher than five to six millions—seven to eight perhaps. This is
nothing to be horrified about because, as will be explained, adequate provision can be made
for the unemployed. But the cyclical fluctuations of capitalist economy are mainly responsible
for any excess above “normal” unemployment.

replacement and new “investment” (including houses), make the ample
deduction of forty billions (20 per cent, equal to Professor Kuznets’ average
by decades, for 1879–1929). 6 The significance of the remaining one hundred
and sixty billions for our subject rests upon two facts. First, short of atrocious
mismanagement, the huge mass of available commodities and services that
this figure (which still does not include new houses) represents, promises a
level of satisfaction of economic needs even of the poorest members of
society including the aged, unemployed and sick, that would (with a forty
hour week) eliminate anything that could possibly be described as suffering
or want. It has been emphasized in this book that the case for socialism is
by no means wholly economic and also that increasing real income has so
far entirely failed to conciliate either the masses or their intellectual allies.
But in this instance, the promise is not only spectacular but immediate: not
much more is involved in its fulfillment than that the abilities and resources
that have proved their power during the war, turn from production for war
purposes, including the exports of consumers’ goods to Allied countries, to
production for the purposes of domestic consumption; after 1950 the
argument would apply a fortiori. Second—again short of atrocious
mismanagement—all this can be accomplished without violating the organic
conditions of a capitalist economy, including high premia on industrial
success and all the other inequalities of income that may be required in order
to make the capitalist engine work according to design. In the United States
alone there need not lurk, behind modern programs of social betterment, that
fundamental dilemma that everywhere else paralyzes the will of every
responsible man, the dilemma between economic progress and immediate
increase of the real income of the masses.

Moreover, with gross national product at 200 billions, there is no
difficulty in collecting public revenue in the amount of 40 billions without
injury to the economic engine. A sum of 30 billions is sufficient, at 1928
prices, to finance all the functions actually fulfilled by the federal, state and
local governments in 1939 plus a greatly enlarged military establishment plus
the service of the debt and other permanent obligations that have been
incurred since. 7 This will leave roughly 10 billions—at 1928 prices or a
correspondingly higher amount at any higher price level that may prevail 8 —
6 A depreciation allowance of about ten to 12 per cent is not unduly high for a system
running at as high a level of production. Eight to ten per cent for “new” investment is certainly
ample and, according to most forecasters, too much. See below, sub 5.
7 For the purpose in hand, it is not necessary to distinguish between public expenditure on
goods and services and “transfers.” But it is assumed that, roughly, the thirty billions would
divide up into twenty-five billions for the former and five billions of the latter. It should be
observed that this takes no account (for 1950) of veterans’ pensions and other benefits, a
problem that should be treated apart.

in 1950 and much more than this in another decade, for the financing of new
social services or of improvements in the existing ones.
3. But it is here, namely, in the sphere of public finance and
administration, that the meaning of our proviso—“short of atrocious
mismanagement”—is most vividly brought home to us. For in this sphere
we actually have mismanagement of national resources that is truly
atrocious. With present principles and present practice, it is not true that
40 billions can be collected, at a 200-billion level of gross national product,
without injury to the economic engine. And it is not true that the 30
billions—or whatever may correspond to them at price levels other than
that of 1928—meet the requirements mentioned. This is only true if the
whole of the public administration be rationalized with a view to
eliminating double and triple-track activities—such as we have in the case
of the income taxes, to mention but one example—overlapping both of
federal agencies and of federal and state and local agencies—lack of
effective co-ordination and well-defined individual responsibility—which,
in the federal case, is mainly due to the nonexistence of well-knit
“ministries” and to the existence of a large number of semi-independent
“authorities” or “boards”—and many other things that are sources of waste
and obstacles to efficiency, but above all, that spirit of waste that delights
in spending a billion where 100 million would do. The present state of
things portends nothing but evil for public management of finance and
industry and, in fact, is in itself good and sufficient reason to oppose it for
many who are anything but “economic royalists.”

Nor is this all. Economy—how unpopular this word has become!—

may in a sense be less necessary in a wealthy country than it is in a poor
one, namely in the sense that waste threatens want in the latter and not
in the former. But in another sense, economy—that is, real economy and
not the sham economy of the bureaucracy and of Congress who are ready
enough to save pennies while squandering billions—is just as necessary
in a rich country in order to make efficient use of its wealth as it is in a
poor country in order to secure bare subsistence. 9 And this applies not
only to the cost of public administration but also to the use of funds that
are to be paid out in various benefits. The classic example is, of course,
provision for unemployment so far as it consists in payments to
individuals. Unless the behavior of workmen, in employment and out of
it, be as strictly under public control as it is in Russia, economical use
8 Revenue cannot, in general, he assumed to change in proportion to price level. For
our purpose, however, which is merely to gain a rough idea, we may adopt this
simplifying hypothesis.
9 The theory that holds the exact opposite of this will be discussed below, sub 5.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties386
of the funds available for the support of the unemployed inevitably means
that the benefit must be substantially below the wages the unemployed
can hope to earn. As United States statistics of labor turnover suggest,
there is normally in the country a large fringe of half voluntary and half
involuntary unemployment, the burden of which is bound to be increased,
by loose administration of unemployment benefits or by rates that are
high relatively to wages, so as to destroy the possibility of attaining the
two hundred billion goal.

There is still another condition that would have to be fulfilled in order
to justify this possibility: “Politics” and bureaucracy must not prevent our
reaching it. Nothing should be more obvious than that the business
organism cannot function according to design when its most important
“parameters of action”—wages, prices, interest—are transferred to the
political sphere and there dealt with according to the requirements of the
political game or, which sometimes is more serious still, according to the
ideas of some planners. Three examples must suffice to illustrate this. First,
the actual labor situation, if it persist, is in itself sufficient to obstruct
progress toward that goal of a two hundred billion gross national product
and, still more, progress beyond it. The resulting wage rates are only one
reason for this; dislocation of entrepreneurial planning and disorganization
of workers even when employed are equally important. Besides preventing
an otherwise possible expansion of output, these conditions also reduce
employment below its otherwise possible level by putting an abnormal
premium on everybody’s employing as little labor as possible—they induce
a sort of “flight from labor. 10

10 It will be observed that increase in output and increase in employment are not treated as
synonymous. It is, in fact, possible, within certain limits, to decrease employment without
decreasing output or to increase the latter without increasing the former. The reason why in
current literature output and employment are often made to vary proportionately is to be found
in one of the fundamental features of the Keynesian system. This system is restricted to dealing
with quite short-run chains of causation by the assumption that quantity and quality of industrial
equipment remain constant so that the combination of factors of production cannot change
significantly. If this were so (and in the shortest run it is approximately so), then of course they
vary together though, in general, not proportionately.

It will also be observed that our argument implies that changes in money wage rates may
cause changes in employment of opposite sign. I believe, in fact, that the high level of American
money wage rates has always, but especially in the thirties, been a major cause of American
unemployment, and that similar consequences are to be expected in the future if high-wage
policies be continued. This proposition contradicts the teaching of Keynesian orthodoxy as well
as that of some other economists and cannot be established here. It is therefore fortunate that,
for our present purpose, and so far as 1950 is concerned and not any later development, a weaker
proposition will do which would have commanded the assent of the late Lord Keynes: under
the conditions that are likely to prevail in this country during the next four years, and unless
compensated by additional increases in prices, higher wage rates will adversely affect both
output and employment and the latter more than the former.


Second, whatever the reader may believe to be its virtues, price control
as practiced hitherto is another obstacle to the expansion of output. I have
heard that the Stalinist regime encourages criticism of its bureaucracy.
Evidently, this is not so with us. I will defer to prevailing etiquette by
granting outright that many able men have done excellent service in the
O.P.A.; that many others, not so able, have still done their best; and I will
suppress any doubts that may exist in my mind concerning its achievements
up to the present moment, especially because its most conspicuous failures
link up with circumstances over which it had no control. But it should really
be admitted, at least for the present and future, that the policy of encouraging
increases in wage rates combined with price control, unless intended to
enforce surrender of private enterprise, is irrational and inimical to prompt
expansion of output; that the disturbance of the system of relative prices
resulting from the fact that the regulating agency can “keep the lid on” some
prices—the prices of producers with little political pull—very much more
effectively than on others—the prices of producers with plenty of political
pull—reduces the degree of economic efficiency of the system; that price
fixing per se does not define the whole extent of the damage done: equally
important is the premium that the practice of “subsidizing” high-cost and
“squeezing” low-cost producers puts upon inefficiency. 11

The bureaucracy’s persistent hostility, strongly supported as it is by
public opinion, to industrial self-government—self-organization, self-
regulation, co-operation—is a third obstacle to orderly progress and,
incidentally, to a development that might solve many problems of
business-cycle policy and eventually also the problem of transition to a
socialist régime. Spokesmen of the bureaucracy invariably deny that there
is any foundation for this view because joint action of businessmen
becomes illegal and open to prosecution only if it implies “collusive
restraint.” But, even if this legalistic interpretation of prevailing practice
could be accepted—and if the official theories of what constitutes
collusive restraint or, in general, anti-social practice could also be
11 I do not pretend to know what will eventually come of the muddle occasioned by the
presidential veto of the first Price Control Act and the passage of one a month later providing
for rapid decontrol. Since, however, I am prepared to argue that the O.P.A., as it actually
functioned, was bound to bar the way toward an efficient peace economy and since the
possible consequences of that muddle are sure to be represented as proof positive of the
necessity of retaining price control, I must ask the reader to consider two things. First, an
argument for the repeal of price control is not an argument for letting it lapse, without
preparation or transitional substitute, when nobody expected it or seems to have been prepared
for it. Second, if in response to its defeat, the Administration hits out vindictively at targets
chosen for their unpopularity rather than for any defensible reason, consequences may ensue
that are entirely unconnected with the lapse of price control per se. As to the problem of
inflation, see below sub 4.

accepted 12 —it would still remain true (a) that the concept of “restraint”
includes the bulk of attempts at industrial co-operation with regard to
price and output policy even where such co-operation does fill a much-
needed function; (b) that borderline cases and cases in which the element
of restraint enters without constituting the main point of an agreement
are not sure to be considered with impartiality by a personnel that
contains many men inadequately familiar with the nature of business
problems and some who are violently opposed to the system they are to
regulate or at least to the “big-business” sector of it; and (c) that the ever-
present threat of prosecution for offenses which it is not always easy to
distinguish from unoffending business practice may have effects on the
conduct of business nobody intends it to have.
The last point illustrates an aspect of labor troubles, O.P.A. troubles,
and “antitrust” troubles that never receives the attention it merits, namely,
the consequent drain on entrepreneurial and managerial energy. The
businessman who is incessantly thrown out of his stride not only by
having to face ever new institutional data but also by having to be “up
before” this or that board, has no steam left for dealing with his
technological and commercial problems. It is highly revelatory of the
mechanistic attitude of economists and of their remoteness from “real
life” that not one in ten will recognize this particular “human element”
of what is after all a human organism—though no sensible man can
possibly fail, for example, to link up the relatively poor showing made
by the physical-volume index of industrial production in 1945 with this
element as one of its many causes. Nor is this all. Success in conducting
a business enterprise depends under present conditions much more on the
ability to deal with labor leaders, politicians and public officials than it
does on business ability in the proper sense of the term. Hence, except
in the biggest concerns that can afford to employ specialists of all kinds,
leading positions tend to be filled by “fixers” and “trouble shooters”
rather than by “production men.”

12 As a matter of fact, however, these theories cannot be accepted. They cover indeed a range
of practices which everyone will agree must be outlawed by any legal system. But beyond these
there is another range of practices with regard to which the legal mind simply adopts the attitude
dictated by popular prejudices. An important source of examples is discrimination. Even the
most competent economist will experience considerable difficulties in analyzing all the long-
run effects of a given case. If justice is administered on nothing but general legal or popular
slogans and by demonstration “drives,” the element of sound sense contained in the anti-
discrimination attitude may completely disappear. And the well-meant method of selective
prosecution which is intended to allow for cases where formally illegal discrimination benefits
all parties concerned—everyone who ever had an elementary course in economics knows, or
should know, such cases—may then only avail to add a most irritating arbitrariness. It is only
in a passing remark that we can indicate methods of remedying this state of things.


It may seem to the reader that policy on the lines indicated by all this
is out of the question—that it is bound to break down in a storm of
righteous indignation or founder on the rocks of sabotage and other forms
of resistance and that, therefore, the two hundred billion goal itself is
little better than a daydream. But this does not quite follow. On the one
hand, the economic engine of this country is strong enough to stand some
waste and irrationality—including, as we know, some avoidable
unemployment, the price of individual freedom. On the other hand,
politicians and the public have of late displayed some signs of “coming
round.” And we must not forget that malleability of human nature which
has been so much emphasized in this book (see especially Chapter XVIII,
section II). The experiment of the New Deal and war periods may be
inconclusive because the industrial bourgeoisie never expected those
conditions to last. But some “education” has probably been effected.
Thus relatively small adjustments of existing taxation may be all that is
required, if not for maximum efficiency, yet for an adequate degree of
13 For instance—this is not intended to be more than an example from a set of possible
methods—the following measures might be substantially sufficient, (a) Elimination of the
double taxation of that part of the returns to corporate industry which is paid out in
dividends; in view of the British practice, this would hardly justify a “storm of righteous
indignation”: our practice is the German one and the purely formal argument for it is due
to the German economist, Adolf Wagner (1835–1917). (b) Permission to deduct from
taxable income that part of individual income which is invested. Personally, I agree with
Professor Irving Fisher’s opinion that the part saved should be deducted (particularly in
view of the danger of inflation). But in order to spare Keynesian susceptibilities I limit
myself to the part invested. Technical difficulties are not serious, at least not insuperable,
(c) Adoption of one of several methods that are available in order to allow full deduction
of losses over time, (d) Nationalization, systematization, and development of sales or
turnover taxes. This should appeal to admirers of Russia instead of sending them into
paroxysms of rage. As a matter of fact, at rates like the Russian ones (e.g., thirty-one cents
per pound on the best quality of wheat flour [in Moscow and for 1940] or, since translation
of ruble amounts into dollar amounts is a doubtful matter, sixtytwo per cent of the retail
price of potatoes, seventy-three per cent of that of sugar, eighty per cent of that of salt;
see P.Haensel, “Soviet Finances” in Openbare Financiën, No. 1, 1946) and in a population
so desperately poor as the Russian one, the sales tax may indeed be a terrible scourge; but
at moderate rates and in a country as rich as the United States it is an excellent and
perfectly harmless tool of public finance, especially useful in financing purposes that
benefit exclusively the low-income groups. Five or six billions could be raised by it without
anyone’s feeling the burden. But since state and local governments would have to be
compensated for the loss of revenue incident to the nationalization of the tax—it is not
strictly correct, of course, to speak of “introduction”—and since, moreover, certain
adjustments of existing excises would be necessary, the net gain to the Federal Treasury
cannot be estimated at more than about two to three billion dollars, so that sales tax plus
specific excises might yield something like nine to ten billions in all. (e) Nationalization
and drastic downward revision, in favor of wives and children, of the estate taxes, the
reason for this being that existing legislation eliminates, by confiscation above very
moderate figures, one of the essential elements of the capitalist scheme of things. Whoever
approves of this confiscation for extra-economic reasons is, from his standpoint, quite right


it. 13 In another direction, a relatively small increment of legal
protection—to be granted, perhaps, by means of a proper codification of
industrial law—might take the sting or threat of arbitrary vexation out of
the businessman’s working day and increasing experience of the
regulating bodies and better training of their staffs might do the rest. 14
Moreover, the country has given proof, not long ago, of its willingness
to accept legislation like the N.R.A. And as regards the labor situation,
some comfort may perhaps be derived from the fact that policy on the
lines contemplated not only need not renounce a single item of what most
people will consider the main achievements in social reform of the New
Deal but also would provide the economic basis for further advance. It
should be noticed in particular that the Annual Wage is a threat to the
chance of attaining our goal only if it be introduced, administered, and
financed in such ways as to do the maximum of harm. In itself, it is a
perfectly possible proposition.


Even so, it takes a lot of optimism to expect that these necessary
adjustments will be effected—or even that the conditions of the
country’s politics can produce the will to undertake such serious and
self-denying work, unglorified by slogans, bristling with difficulties of
detail, and eminently thankless. The mass of the people would like the
in advocating a constitutional amendment to that effect; whoever approves of this
confiscation on the economic argument to be found on p. 373 of the late Lord Keynes’s
General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money—or a derivative of this—is quite
wrong.

We are not concerned with the question what would satisfy the interests affected
politically. As a matter of fact, however, most proposals of tax reform that have so
far come from businessmen’s organizations are distinctly modest which, if not
otherwise relevant for our argument, seems to show how effectively the business class
has been “educated.”

14 I am adverting here to a point that is important for many more topics than the one in
hand. A good bureaucracy is a slow growth and cannot be created at will. The bureaucratic
organs of the United States display the ailments of rapid growth to an extent which makes a
temporary policy of taking in sails a matter not only of the public interest but of, their own.
Among other things, the Washington bureaucracy has not yet discovered its place. It happens
again and again that individual members of it pursue programs of their own, feel themselves
to be reformers and negotiate with Congressmen, Senators, and members of other agencies over
the heads of their chiefs. Some idea may suddenly acquire compelling force of which nobody
knows the origin. That way lies chaos and failure.
15 To illustrate this point, let us recall a bit of recent history. New Dealers in the early
thirties, adopted the practice of sneering at the slogan Reform vs. Recovery. The sneer proves
that they were perfectly aware of the element of truth in it. In fact, as political slogans go, this
one was perfectly fair. But it should be understood to refer to the bungling and irresponsible
manner in which “reform” was carried out, not to any of its professed aims. We are in a similar
position now and the misfortune is that injury to the economic process of capitalism is for some
people precisely the feature of reform they like best. Reform without such injury would be all
but unattractive to them. And reform paralleled by a policy that insures capitalist success would
be the worst that could befall them.

America that might emerge from the job but they would hate the man
who takes it in hand.

4. We have not yet mentioned Transitional Problems. They are in fact
not relevant to our subject except in this respect: transitional difficulties
may produce situations and induce measures that are likely to impede the
expansion of output quasi-permanently and to invalidate our “estimate of
possibilities” completely. The most obvious as well as most serious
instance is the danger of inflation. The wholesale price index for 1920 was
about 2.3 times the one of 1914. This happened in consequence of a war
effort that was not only much smaller and shorter than the recent one in
terms of goods and services but also more responsibly financed per unit
of goods and services. There was nothing like the present backlog of
demand. And tax privileges had provided an adequate motive for investors
to keep large blocks of war bonds for good. As it is, Total Deposits
Adjusted (time and demand, other than interbank and United States
Government deposits, less items in process of collection) and Currency
Outside of Banks amounted, in April of the current year to 174 billions
(55.17 in June 1929, and 60.9 in June 1939), and there is no saying what
part of the public’s holdings of government bonds will be turned into cash
for purposes other than repayment of debt. Any sensible person should be
able to form an opinion about what this means under the given
circumstances, especially in view of the government’s encouragement of,
or connivance at, the reckless but universal demand for higher money wage
rates—for inflation comes through the payroll. 16 The same sensible person
should not find it difficult to make up his mind regarding writers who
preach that there is “no” danger of inflation 17 as well as regarding writers
who see wild inflation round the corner. In order to make the one point
that is relevant to our argument and in the face of the impossibility of
treating the problem satisfactorily here, let me proffer my personal opinion
merely for the sake of definiteness: It seems to me to be possible—
possible—to aim, for 1950, at a price level about 50 per cent above the
1928 figure (with bursts beyond that in the interval); it seems to me to be
rational to use, to this extent, price-level movements as an instrument of
adaptation; and it seems to me that the terrors of such an increase in
general prices as well as the terrors of a descent from it in later years are
16 The reader will please observe that this particular statement is good Keynesianism and
should therefore command assent from Washington economists.
17 Among these we must include some of those forecasters of postwar demand who predicted
that, immediately upon the cessation of a great part of the government’s war demand, a slump
and widespread unemployment, calling for further deficit spending was sure to follow. On these
(short-run) predictions, see E.Schiff’s article in a forthcoming number of the Review of
Economic Statistics. Corresponding long-run predictions will be discussed below, sub 5.


greatly exaggerated. But in order to keep the inevitable increase in prices
within that limit, a number of measures are necessary, all of which are
highly unpopular, all of which require, in order to produce their result,
experience and ability that I do not see, and some of which will, to some
extent, reduce the speed of the expansion of output; nobody can counteract
threatening inflation without also interfering with production. Now, if,
instead, nothing is done except setting up another O.P.A. and taxing heavily
precisely those incomes from which—even according to the doctrine held
by our radicals—inflation does not threaten and if in addition wage rates
are being pushed up regardless of consequences, a situation may well arise
in which, in desperation, Washington may resort to clumsy and brutal
measures such as devaluation, “freezing” deposits, assuming “direct
control,” punishing “profiteers” and “monopolists,” or some other
scapegoats, keeping carefully clear of the farmers. And this may upset
apple carts to such an extent as to bring us into the immediate vicinity not
of the two hundred billion goal but of some half-baked socialism. May.
There are, of course, other possibilities.

5. It remains to notice what to many economists is the postwar
problem par excellence: how to secure adequate consumption. So far we
have indeed seen many reasons for doubting whether the goal
envisaged—a gross national product of two hundred billions in 1928
dollars—will actually be reached by 1950. But all of them were founded
upon the possibility or likelihood that obstacles external to the business
process might bar the way. The power of the business process itself to
produce that result has, however, been called in question by many
economists most, but not all of whom are identified with certain articles
of political as well as scientific faith. We will refer to them by a term
that has gained some currency, Stagnationists. 18

The relevant type of stagnationist theory has been developed by the late
Lord Keynes. With its application to the case in hand the reader can best
familiarize himself by studying one or more of those estimates of postwar
demand that have been produced during the last few years.19 Their authors
agree with us in estimating potential production for 1950 at figures that are
of the same order of magnitude as is our own so that we may, for the sake
of simplicity, continue to speak of a gross national product of two hundred
billions. They are even more optimistic than we in that they do not insist on
the necessity of environmental conditions favorable to capitalist
18 On some general aspects of the stagnationist thesis, see above, Chapter X.

references are therefore unnecessary.

achievement, 20 but reason on the tacit assumption that present political,
administrative, and labor practices persist. Moreover, I shall waive any
objections I may have against their estimates of the inevitable minimum of
unemployment, or the validity of their statistical methods, and I shall also
accept the various hypotheses by means of which they arrive at the figures
of Net National Income and of Disposable Income (the sum total of
individual incomes after tax and compulsory nontax payments). For
definiteness, let us suppose that this disposable income figures out at about
150 billions and that corporate undivided profits are about 6 billions. 21
Postwar demand, that is to say, the sum total which it is expected private
households will spend on consumers’ goods (except new homes), is then
derived by calculating, from the data for the period preceding the war, say,
1923–1940, the average relation between per capita expenditure on these
consumers’ goods and per capita disposable income, both deflated by the
cost-of-living index, and by applying this relation to a disposable income of
150 billions.22 If this procedure yields, for example, the sum of 130 billions,
we are left with a residual in the amount of 20 billions for savings or, if we
add the corporate undivided profits, with 26 billions. The argument usually
goes on to survey the available outlets for this sum, the investment
opportunities (new housing, additions to inventories, plant and equipment,
foreign investment) and to conclude or to suggest that these cannot possibly
absorb anything like as much as people will want to save at the 1950 full-
employment level of national income, at least not without the help of
government. Hence, the necessity of government expenditure at home or
government action forcing “foreign investment.” Of late, however, another
recommendation has come into favor. Since, under present conditions,
anyone who advocates government deficit financing is in obvious danger of
making himself ridiculous, Washington economists have veered round to
20 I confess that I have wondered occasionally whether they are aware of the tremendous
compliment to private enterprise which this implies.

21 These figures approximate those of one of the postwar-demand estimators. They are
not mine. Nor are they compatible with the experimental figures on which we reasoned in
section II. For the procedure as applied to past periods—where hypotheses are of course
replaced by facts—see e.g., Federal Reserve Bulletin, April, 1946, p. 436. It should,
however, be observed, first, that these figures are in current dollars and, second, that the
huge amount of “net savings of individuals” proves nothing for the saving percentages of
“normal” times and that even the figures for 1937, 1938, 1939 and 1940 should not be
accepted uncritically and especially not without reference to the definition of saving
adopted by the Department of Commerce.

22 Actually, the procedure is somewhat more complicated than that. The regression equations
used also contain a trend factor that is to take account of possible changes of the relation over
time. Moreover, some account is also taken of the effects of deferred demand and of the
accumulation of liquid means. But, in order to concentrate on the salient point, we do not go
into all this.

recommend balanced budgets, but budgets balanced at a very high level of
taxation, the taxes to be highly progressive so as to eliminate the high
incomes, from which the menace of saving primarily proceeds. This accords
with the slogan that (owing to the saving done by the receivers of high
incomes) “in modern societies, the ultimate cause of unemployment is the
inequality of incomes.”

Thus the high level of national income to which we have looked for
the solution of a good many economic and social problems is itself made
out to be the most serious problem of all. Since high income means high
savings and since these savings will not be entirely offset by investment
expenditure, it will not be possible for the economy to keep on that high
level of income and employment—unless fiscal policy keeps it there—if
indeed this high level can be reached at all. It should be observed that,
at least in part, this theory commands the support of public opinion and
in particular of business opinions. Nothing is more common than the
view that everything will be all right if only we can induce people “to
use their incomes fully” or if only we can “get enough consumers’
demand.” It is a question of some interest why intelligent men who
certainly have no stake in any political program involving government
expenditure or equalization of income, should nevertheless feel concern
on this score. The salesman mentality of the country coupled with the
experience of the twenty years preceding the war is all the explanation I
can offer for the astounding fact that the theory in question is not simply
laughed out of court.
Those opponents of this theory miss the point who try to argue that
gross national product, hence income, will be smaller and that investment
opportunities will turn out to be greater than estimators assume who are
so optimistic when it comes to estimating the former and so pessimistic
when it comes to estimating the latter. There may be much truth in
arguments on these and similar lines. In particular, it may be emphasized
that in 1830 nobody foresaw or could have foreseen the capital
requirements of the railroad age or, fifty years later, the capital
requirements of the age of electricity. But the decisive argument is much
simpler than all that. The theory rests upon the postulate that individuals
save, according to a stable psychological law, 23 irrespective of the presence
1.when Y increases by Y, C increases by C < Y or This is the genuine Keynesian
hypothesis about what is known as the Consumption Function. But Keynes himself used
occasionally, and his followers use often, the stronger assumption that, as income increases, the
saving percentage increases. We are concerned only with the genuine hypothesis. It should,

or absence of investment opportunity. Evidently this is not the normal case.
Normally people save with a view to some return, in money or in services
of some “investment good.” It is not only that the bulk of individual
savings—and, of course, practically all business savings which, in turn,
constitute the greater part of total saving—is done with a specific
investment purpose in view. The decision to invest precedes as a rule, and
the act of investing precedes very often, the decision to save. Even in those
cases in which a man saves without specific investment purpose, any delay
in coming to an investment decision is punished by the loss of return for
the interval. It seems to follow, first, that unless people see investment
opportunities, they will not normally save and that a situation of vanishing
investment opportunity is likely to be also one of vanishing saving; and,
second, that whenever we observe that people display “liquidity
preference,” that is to say, a desire to save unaccompanied by a desire to
invest—a desire to hoard—this must be explained by special reasons and
not by appeal to any psychological law postulated ad hoc.
Such reasons do exist, however, and there is one among them that is of
considerable importance in the depth of cyclical depressions—on a broad
average, in one year out of ten. When things look black and people expect
nothing but losses from any commitment they might contemplate, then of
course they will refuse to invest their current savings (and even to reinvest
sums that currently return to them owing to the termination of previous
commitments), or they will defer investment in order to profit by further
reductions in prices. At the same time, savings will be not only not reduced
but increased by all those who expect impending losses of income, in their
business or through unemployment. This is an important element in the
mechanism of depressions and public deficit spending is indeed one of the
most obvious means for breaking such “vicious spirals.” However, no
defense of any “oversaving” theory can be based upon it because it occurs
only as a consequence of a depression that hence cannot itself be explained
by it. But it yields a psychological explanation of the Keynesian
psychological law. The great depression of 1929–1932 and the slow recovery
from it are still in everybody’s mind. And the psychological law and the
theory of hoarding that is based upon it are simply generalizations from that
experience. 24

however, be observed that it is a misuse of terms to call it a psychological law. Psychological
laws in economics are doubtful customers at best. But the proposition in question has not
even so much title to being dignified by this term as has, e.g., the proposition that our wish
for one more slice of bread decreases in intensity as we go on eating more and more slices.
24 Adaptation of the above argument together with certain wartime factors will, it is hoped,
explain wartime accumulations of liquid means without recourse to the hypothesis of an
insatiable hunger for hoards inherent in human nature.

Depression-hoarding is therefore not a genuine exception to our
general proposition, viz., that decisions to save depend upon and
presuppose decisions to invest, though the converse is not true,
because it is obviously possible to finance an investment by a bank
loan in which case there is no point whatever in speaking of anyone’s
saving. 25 There are genuine exceptions, besides apparent ones. But
neither are of any importance. Instances of genuine exceptions are
hoarding with the intention of accumulating a treasure which as
everybody knows has been done extensively in India, China, and
Egypt; and, temporarily, saving from a habit which once formed may
outlive its rationale as may any other habit. 26 Instances of apparent
exceptions, similar to our case of depression-hoarding, are
accumulations for the purpose of financing a very heavy piece of
investment, a possible but evidently unimportant case; or “saving” that
is undertaken for the purpose of providing for contingencies, old age
and so on and would be undertaken even if there were no opportunities
for acquiring any “return” other than a feeling of security. 27
25 Our proposition is, however, not so simple as it may seem to readers unfamiliar with
the discussion that has been carried on ever since the publication of Lord Keynes’s General
Theory (1936). It resembles rather than repeats an old theorem of the “classical theory”
(Turgot, A.Smith, J.S.Mill) and cannot be sustained by the reasoning that satisfied the
classics. A long and tedious argument would be necessary in order to establish it fully, an
argument which it is so discouraging to have to work out because it yields but few new
and interesting results and beyond this merely destroys what has been built up with so much
trouble during the thirties. Lack of space prevents us, however, from going into it. But one
point must be mentioned in order to avoid a misunderstanding that would be as regrettable
as it would be natural. Though our proposition shows that the stagnation thesis cannot be
based upon the element of saving and though this may be expressed by saying that there
is no problem of saving in this sense, it does not amount to saying that there are no
problems of saving in other senses. There are. Most of them center around the case in which
individual savings, by way of purchase of securities, are applied to the repayment of bank
debts incurred by firms in the course of expanding their plant and equipment. But this is
another matter.
26 The persistence of saving habits that are deeply rooted in the bourgeois scheme of
life, especially in the puritan variant of it, may not seem to be unimportant. But the
vanishing of investment opportunities that would render those habits irrational would, in
the absence of external factors, be a slow process during which adaptation could and
would have time to do its work. Washington economists who wish to assert, nevertheless,
that the persistence of saving habits that have become irrational is a factor in the
economic situation are therefore faced by an unenviable alternative: they would have to
admit either that the situation of the thirties was one of depression hoarding—which
spells surrender of the secular-stagnation thesis—or that attractiveness of investment was
with comparative suddenness reduced by an external factor which could be no other than
the policies they themselves supported. If they adopt the latter view, it is certainly not
for me to object.
27 The unimportance of this follows mainly from two facts: first, that these
accumulations are currently depleted (though, with changing national income and age
The Consequences of the Second World War 397
Thus, if the sorrows of stagnationists were the only ones to trouble us,
we should entertain no misgivings about reaching the two hundred billion
gross national product. And if twenty billions proved more than can be newly
invested, at a rate of return satisfactory to the marginal saver, why, people
would be only too happy to consume the excess. We should worry neither
about measures to make them “fully use their incomes” nor about outlets for
corporate and individual savings. In particular, we should not think it
necessary to force foreign investment, advocacy of which under present
conditions is nothing but an attempt to make palatable to the country what
really amounts to imposing a war indemnity upon it. 28
On the other hand, we should agree with the advocates of government
deficit spending so far as this: Whenever there is danger, either from causes
inherent to the business-cycle mechanism or from any other, of a “downward
cumulative process,” that is to say, whenever a situation threatens to emerge
in which A’s restriction of production induces B to restrict and so on
throughout the economy, in which prices fall because they have fallen, in
which unemployment feeds upon itself, government deficit spending will
stop this “vicious spiral” and therefore, if we choose to neglect all other
considerations, may be justly called an efficient remedy. 29 The true objection
is not against income-generating government expenditure in emergencies
distribution of the population increments and decrements will not, in general, exactly
balance); and, second, that so long as there is any saving at all that is motivated by
monetary returns, the presence in the total “supply” of an element that is not so motivated
does not prove any tendency toward excess saving. This case needs no strengthening. But
actually it may be reinforced by observing that under modern conditions insurance greatly
reduces the amounts necessary to attain the objects of contingency saving: of old, provision
e.g. for old age and for the needs of wives and children normally meant the accumulation
of a “fortune” (though of course this was not left uninvested); now such provision is
effected by “withholdings from consumption” to the amount of insurance premia. The
increase in insurance during the last twenty-five years, therefore, indicates the exact
opposite of what it is made to indicate in stagnationist writings.
28 Far be it for me to say or to imply that, on moral or political grounds, a case cannot
be made for large sacrifices on the part of the American people. But the case ought to be
put frankly upon the moral and political grounds and not upon a denial of the reality of
these sacrifices, based on questionable economics. The suggestion that part of the excessive
savings might usefully be directed into channels where evidently there is no hope for
repayment, let alone returns, is the more insidious because the class whose task it might
be to oppose such a policy will accept it with alacrity: for under a system of government
guarantees the individual businessman risks little or nothing. And he attaches little if any
weight to the national loss—especially if told that this loss, owing to the employment it
secures, is really a national gain.
29 This is why the Murray bill in its original form (not only in the form in which it has been
enacted) was unexceptionable so far as purely economic considerations are concerned. The
wholesale condemnation of income-generating government expenditure under any circumstances
is understandable and may be justifiable in people who think that, once the use of this tool be
granted, the door will be wide open for all kinds of legislative and administrative
irresponsibilities. But it cannot be upheld on purely economic grounds.



once they have arisen but to policies that create the emergencies in which
such expenditure imposes itself.
6. Unfortunately, however, if it were a question of predicting what will
actually happen, our result would not differ so much from that of the
stagnationists as the reader might expect. Though there is nothing to fear
from people’s propensity to save, there is plenty to fear from other factors.
Labor unrest, price regulation, vexatious administration and irrational
taxation are quite adequate to produce results for income and employment
that will look exactly like a verification of the stagnationist theory and may
indeed produce situations in which public deficit spending imposes itself.
We may even witness what will look like oversaving, namely, conditions
in which people will be reluctant to carry out their investment decisions.
We have been discussing a possibility. We have found that there are no
causes inherent in the business process itself to prevent it from being
realized. We have also seen that there are causes external to the business
process that may do so. Beyond this I do not pretend to know what the
actual outcome will be. Whatever it is, it will be a dominant factor in the
social situation not only in the United States but also in the world. But only
for the next half century or so. The long-run diagnosis elaborated in this
book will not be affected.
