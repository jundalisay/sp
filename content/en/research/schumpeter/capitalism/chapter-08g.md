6. Glancing back we realize that most of the facts and arguments touched upon in this chapter tend to dim the halo that once surrounded perfect
competition as much as they suggest a more favorable view of its alternative.

I will now briefly restate our argument from this angle.

Traditional theory itself, even within its chosen precincts of a stationary
or steadily growing economy, has since the time of Marshall and Edgeworth
been discovering an increasing number of exceptions to the old propositions
about perfect competition and, incidentally, free trade, that have shaken that
unqualified belief in its virtues cherished by the generation which flourished
between Ricardo and Marshall—roughly, J.S.Mill’s generation in England
and Francesco Ferrara’s on the Continent. Especially the propositions that a
perfectly competitive system is ideally economical of resources and allocates
them in a way that is optimal with respect to a given distribution of income—
propositions very relevant to the question of the behavior of output—cannot
now be held with the old confidence. 22

Much more serious is the breach made by more recent work in the field
of dynamic theory (Frisch, Tinbergen, Roos, Hicks and others). Dynamic
analysis is the analysis of sequences in time. In explaining why a certain
economic quantity, for instance a price, is what we find it to be at a given
moment, it takes into consideration not only the state of other economic
quantities at the same moment, as static theory does, but also their state at
preceding points of time, and the expectations about their future values. Now
the first thing we discover in working out the propositions that thus relate
quantities belonging to different points of time 23 is the fact that, once
equilibrium has been destroyed by some disturbance, the process of
establishing a new one is not so sure and prompt and economical as the old
theory of perfect competition made it out to be; and the possibility that the
very struggle for adjustment might lead such a system farther away from
instead of nearer to a new equilibrium. This will happen in most cases unless
the disturbance is small. In many cases, lagged adjustment is sufficient to
produce this result.



<!-- 22 Since we cannot enter into the subject, I will refer the reader to Mr. R.F. Kahn’s paper
entitled “Some Notes on Ideal Output” (Economic Journal for March 1935), which covers much
of this ground.
23 The term dynamics is loosely used and carries many different meanings. The above
definition was formulated by Ragnar Frisch. -->

All I can do here is to illustrate by the oldest, simplest and most familiar example. Suppose that demand and intended supply are in
equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market for wheat, but that bad
weather reduces the crop below what farmers intended to supply. If price
rises accordingly and the farmers thereupon produce that quantity of
wheat which it would pay them to produce if that new price were the
equilibrium price, then a slump in the wheat market will ensue in the
following year. If now the farmers correspondingly restrict production,
a price still higher than in the first year may result to induce a still greater
expansion of production than occurred in the second year. And so on (as
far as the pure logic of the process is concerned) indefinitely. The reader
will readily perceive, from a survey of the assumptions involved, that no
great fear need be entertained of ever higher prices’ and ever greater
outputs’ alternating till doomsday. But even if reduced to its proper
proportions, the phenomenon suffices to show up glaring weaknesses in
the mechanism of perfect competition. As soon as this is realized much
of the optimism that used to grace the practical implications of the theory
of this mechanism passes out through the ivory gate.

But from our standpoint we must go further than that. 24 If we try to
visualize how perfect competition works or would work in the process of
creative destruction, we arrive at a still more discouraging result. This will
not surprise us, considering that all the essential facts of that process are
absent from the general schema of economic life that yields the traditional
propositions about perfect competition. At the risk of repetition I will
illustrate the point once more.

Perfect competition implies free entry into every industry. It is quite true,
within that general theory, that free entry into all industries is a condition
for optimal allocation of resources and hence for maximizing output. If our
economic world consisted of a number of established industries producing
familiar commodities by established and substantially invariant methods and
if nothing happened except that additional men and additional savings
combine in order to set up new firms of the existing type, then impediments
to their entry into any industry they wish to enter would spell loss to the
community. But perfectly free entry into a new field may make it impossible
to enter it at all. The introduction of new methods of production and new
commodities is hardly conceivable with perfect—and perfectly prompt—
competition from the start. And this means that the bulk of what we call
economic progress is incompatible with it. As a matter of fact, perfect
competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever
anything new is being introduced—automatically or by measures devised for
the purpose—even in otherwise perfectly competitive conditions.

Similarly, within the traditional system the usual indictment of rigid prices
stands all right. Rigidity is a type of resistance to adaptation that perfect and
prompt competition excludes. And for the kind of adaptation and for those
conditions which have been treated by traditional theory, it is again quite true
that such resistance spells loss and reduced output. But we have seen that
in the spurts and vicissitudes of the process of creative destruction the
opposite may be true: perfect and instantaneous flexibility may even produce
functionless catastrophes. This of course can also be established by the
general dynamic theory which, as mentioned above, shows that there are
attempts at adaptation that intensify disequilibrium.

<!-- 24 It should be observed that the defining feature of dynamic theory has nothing to do with
the nature of the economic reality to which it is applied. It is a general method of analysis rather
than a study of a particular process. We can use it in order to analyze a stationary economy,
just as an evolving one can be analyzed by means of the methods of statics (“comparative
statics”). Hence dynamic theory need not take, and as a matter of fact has not taken, any special
cognizance of the process of creative destruction which we have taken to be the essence of
capitalism. It is no doubt better equipped than is static theory to deal with many questions of
mechanism that arise in the analysis of that process. But it is not an analysis of that process
itself, and it treats the resulting individual disturbances of given states and structures just as it
treats other disturbances. To judge the functioning of perfect competition from the standpoint
of capitalist evolution is therefore not the same thing as judging it from the standpoint of
dynamic theory. -->


Again, under its own assumptions, traditional theory is correct in holding
that profits above what is necessary in each individual case to call forth the
equilibrium amount of means of production, entrepreneurial ability included,
both indicate and in themselves imply net social loss and that business
strategy that aims at keeping them alive is inimical to the growth of total
output. Perfect competition would prevent or immediately eliminate such
surplus profits and leave no room for that strategy. But since in the process
of capitalist evolution these profits acquire new organic functions—I do not
want to repeat what they are—that fact cannot any longer be unconditionally
credited to the account of the perfectly competitive model, so far as the
secular rate of increase in total output is concerned.
Finally, it can indeed be shown that, under the same assumptions which
amount to excluding the most characteristic features of capitalist reality, a
perfectly competitive economy is comparatively free from waste and in
particular from those kinds of waste which we most readily associate with
its counterpart. But this does not tell us anything about how its account looks
under the conditions set by the process of creative destruction.

On the one hand, much of what without reference to those conditions
would appear to be unrelieved waste ceases to qualify as such when duly
related to them. The type of excess capacity for example that owes its
existence to the practice of “building ahead of demand” or to the practice
of providing capacity for the cyclical peaks of demand would in a regime of perfect competition be much reduced. But when all the facts of the case
are taken into consideration, it is no longer correct to say that perfect
competition wins out on that score. For though a concern that has to accept
and cannot set prices would, in fact, use all of its capacity that can produce
at marginal costs covered by the ruling prices, it does not follow that it would
ever have the quantity and quality of capacity that big business has created
and was able to create precisely because it is in a position to use it
“strategically.” Excess capacity of this type may—it does in some and does
not in other cases—constitute a reason for claiming superiority for a socialist
economy. But it should not without qualification be listed as a claim to
superiority of the perfectly competitive species of capitalist economy as
compared with the “monopoloid” species.

On the other hand, working in the conditions of capitalist evolution, the
perfectly competitive arrangement displays wastes of its own. The firm of
the type that is compatible with perfect competition is in many cases inferior
in internal, especially technological, efficiency. If it is, then it wastes
opportunities. It may also in its endeavors to improve its methods of
production waste capital because it is in a less favorable position to evolve
and to judge new possibilities. And, as we have seen before, a perfectly
competitive industry is much more apt to be routed—and to scatter the bacilli
of depression—under the impact of progress or of external disturbance than
is big business. In the last resort, American agriculture, English coal mining,
the English textile industry are costing consumers much more and are
affecting total output much more injuriously than they would if controlled,
each of them, by a dozen good brains.

Thus it is not sufficient to argue that because perfect competition is
impossible under modern industrial conditions—or because it always has
been impossible—the large-scale establishment or unit of control must be
accepted as a necessary evil inseparable from the economic progress which
it is prevented from sabotaging by the forces inherent in its productive
apparatus. What we have got to accept is that it has come to be the most
powerful engine of that progress and in particular of the long-run expansion
of total output not only in spite of, but to a considerable extent through, this
strategy which looks so restrictive when viewed in the individual case and
from the individual point of time. In this respect, perfect competition is not
only impossible but inferior, and has no title to being set up as a model of
ideal efficiency. It is hence a mistake to base the theory of government
regulation of industry on the principle that big business should be made to
work as the respective industry would work in perfect competition. And
socialists should rely for their criticisms on the virtues of a socialist economy
rather than on those of the competitive model.
