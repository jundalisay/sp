<!-- PART V
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties -->

PROLOGUE

IT IS not for me to write a history of the socialist parties. Both the settings
in which they rose and fell and the ways in which they grappled with their
problems call for a larger canvas and a mightier brush than mine. Also, the
time has not yet come to make the attempt: though the last twenty years have
brought up many valuable monographs that shed all the light we need on
particular situations or phases, a vast amount of research has still to be done
before a history of modern socialism in action can be written that will meet
the requirements of scholarship. But certain facts are necessary in order to
complement and to put into the proper perspective much of what has been
said in the preceding parts of this book. And some other points that have
occurred to me from study or personal observation1 I wish to present because
they seem to be interesting on their own account. For this double purpose I
have assembled the fragments that are to follow, in the hope that even
fragments may indicate the contours of the whole.

Not every reader—not even every socialist reader—will approve of the central
position this fragment gives to Marx and Marxism. I readily confess to personal
bias in the matter. For me, the fascinating thing about socialist policy—the thing
that gives it a special claim to attention and a dignity all its own that is both
intellectual and moral—is its clear and close relation to a doctrinal basis. In
principle at least, it is theory implemented by action or inaction turning on the
true or false perception of a historical necessity. (See Part I.) Even considerations
of expediency and mere tactics carry that character indelebilis and always have
been discussed in the light of that principle. But all this is true only of the
Marxian streak; no truer, of course, than it is, within the bourgeois compound,
of the Benthamite radicals—the “philosophical” radicals as they were
significantly called. All non-Marxian socialist groups are more or less like other
groups and parties; only Marxists of pure persuasion consistently walked in the
light of a doctrine that to them contained all answers to all questions. As will
be seen, I do not admire this attitude unconditionally. It may well be called
narrow and even naïve. But the doctrinaires of all types, whatever their practical
disabilities, have certain esthetic qualities that raise them high above the common
run of political practitioners. Also they command sources of strength which mere
practitioners will never be able to understand.

CHAPTER XXIV

THE NONAGE

SOCIALIST doctrines, in some of their roots presumably as old as
articulate thought, were dreams, beautiful or hateful—impotent longings
out of contact with social realities—so long as they lacked the means to
convince anybody that the social process worked for the realization of
socialism. Socialist effort amounted to preaching in the desert so long as it had
no established contact with an existing or potential source of social power—
to preaching of the Platonic type about which no politician need bother and
which no observer of social processes need list among operative factors.
This is the gist of Marx’s criticism of most of the socialists who preceded
him or in his day offered competitive teaching, and the reason why he called
them Utopian. The point was not so much that many of their schemes were
obviously freaks or otherwise below par intellectually, but that those schemes
were essentially unimplemented and unimplementable. A few examples will
illustrate this and will stand instead of a survey of a large body of literature.
Also they will suffice to show how far Marx’s judgment was wrong.
Sir Thomas More’s (1478–1535) Utopia, read, admired and even
copied right into the nineteenth century—witness the success of Cabet
and of Bellamy—unfolds the picture of a frugal, moral and equalitarian
society that was the exact opposite of English society in More’s day. This
ideal may be but the literary form of social criticism. Perhaps we need
not accept it for a presentation of More’s opinion about the aims of
practical social planning. However, if it be understood in the latter
sense—and so it was—the trouble with it does not lie in its
impracticability. In some respects it is less impracticable than are certain
present-day forms of idyllic socialism. For instance, it faces the question
of authority and it frankly accepts the prospect—exalted no doubt into a
virtue—of a modest standard of life. The real trouble is that there is no
attempt to show how society is to evolve toward that ideal state (except
possibly by conversion) or what the real factors are that might be worked
upon in order to produce it. We can like or dislike the ideal. But we
cannot do much about it. To put the practical dot on the i, there is nothing
in it on which to found a party and to provide a program.
Another type may be instanced by Robert Owen’s (1771–1858) socialism.

A manufacturer and practical reformer, he was not content to conceive—or adopt—the idea of small self-sufficing communities, producing and
consuming their means of livelihood according to communist principles in
the word’s boldest acceptance. He actually went about realizing it. First he
hoped for government action, then he tried the effect of setting an example.
So it might seem that the plan was more operational than More’s: there was
not only an ideal but also a bridge leading to it. Actually however that kind
of bridge only serves to illustrate more precisely the nature of utopianism.
For both government action and individual efforts are introduced as dei ex
machina—the thing would have had to be done just because some agent
thought it worth while. No social force working toward the goal was
indicated or could have been indicated. No soil was provided for the rose
trees—they were left to feed on beauty. 1

The same applies to Proudhon’s (1809–1865) anarchism, except that in
his case definite economic error is much more in evidence than it is with
most of the other classics of anarchism who despised economic argument
and, whether stressing the ideal of free and stateless cooperation of
individuals or the task of destruction to be accomplished in order to make
way for it, avoided errors of reasoning largely by avoiding reasoning. Like
“poet, lunatic and lover of imagination all compact,” they were
constitutionally unable to do anything except to upset socialist applecarts and
to add to confusion in situations of revolutionary excitement. It is not
difficult to sympathize with Marx’s disgust, that sometimes was not unmixed
with despair, at the doings of M.Bakunin.

But anarchism was utopianism with a vengeance. The pathological species
has been mentioned only in order to make it quite clear that such revivals
of fourteenth-century mentality should not be confused with the genuine
brand of Utopian socialism which St. Simon’s (1760–1825) writings display
at its best. There we find sense and responsibility coupled with considerable
analytic power. The goal envisaged was not absurd or visionary. What was
lacking was the way: again the only method suggested was government
action—action by governments that at the time were essentially bourgeois.
If this view be accepted, the great break that put an end to the nonage of
socialism must in fact be associated with the name and work of Karl Marx.
1 The same is true of the similar plan of Charles Fourier (1772–1837) which will not
however be called socialist by everyone, since labor was to receive only 5/12 of the social
product, the rest going to capital and management. Though in itself this was a meritorious
attempt to take account of realities, it is amusing to note that labor would in that ideal state of
things have done worse than it actually does in capitalist society. In prewar England for instance
(see A.Bowley, The Division of the Product of Industry, 1921, p. 37), wages and salaries under
£160 absorbed, in manufacturing and mining, 62 per cent of the value of net output or, counting
in salaries above £160, 68 per cent. Of course Fourier’s ideals were not primarily economic,
but as far as they were, they illustrate well how large an element of ignorance about capitalist
facts enters into reformist creeds
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties308
We may then date it, so far as in such matters dating is possible at all, by
the issue of the Manifesto of the Communist Party (1848) or by the
foundation of the First International (1864): it was in that period that both
the doctrinal and the political criteria of seriousness were met. But, on the
one hand, this achievement only summed up the developments of the
centuries of nonage and, on the other hand, it formulated them in a particular
way that perhaps was practically, but certainly was not logically, the only
possible one. To some extent, therefore, the judgment passed by orthodox
socialism on the men of the nonage must be revised.
First of all, if the socialist schemes of those centuries were dreams, most
of them were rationalized dreams. And what individual thinkers more or less
perfectly succeeded in rationalizing were not simply their individual dreams
but the dreams of the non-ruling classes. Thus, those thinkers were not living
completely in the clouds; they also helped to bring to the surface what
slumbered below but was getting ready to wake up. In this respect even the
anarchists, back to their medieval predecessors who nourished in many a
convent and still more in the tertiary groups of the Franciscan Order, acquire
a significance which Marxists usually do not accord to them. However
contemptible their beliefs may seem to the orthodox socialist, much of the
propelling force of socialism comes, even today, from those irrational
longings of the hungry soul—not belly—which they voiced. 2
Second, the socialist thinkers of the nonage provided many a brick and
many a tool that proved useful later on. After all, the very idea of a socialist
society was their creation, and it was owing to their efforts that Marx and
his contemporaries were able to discuss it as a thing familiar to everyone.
But many of the utopians went much further than that. They worked out
details of the socialist plan or of certain variants of it, thereby formulating
problems—however inadequately—and clearing much ground. Even their
contribution to purely economic analysis cannot be neglected. It provided a
much-needed leaven in an otherwise distressingly stodgy pudding. Much of
it moreover was simply professional work that improved existing theory and,
among other things, stood Marx in good stead. The English socialists and
quasi-socialists who elaborated the labor theory of value—such men as
William Thompson—afford the best example of this.
Third, not all of those whom Marxists include among the utopians lacked
2 That is why the trained socialist’s endeavors to shake off what he himself admits to be
nonsensical or visionary in the creed of the untutored believer can never be wholly successful.
The popular appeal of socialism is due not to what can be rationally established about it, but
precisely to those mystic heresies which bourgeois and socialist economists unite in
condemning. In trying to distance himself, the socialist not only is being ungrateful to the
wave that carries him, but he is also courting the danger that its forces might be harnessed
into other service.
The Nonage 309
contact with mass movements. Some contact inevitably resulted from the fact
that the social and economic conditions which set in motion the intellectual’s
pen will also set in motion some group or class of the people—peasants or
artisans or agricultural laborers or simply the vagrants and the rabble. But
many of the utopians established much closer contact. The demands of the
peasants during the revolutions of the sixteenth century were already
formulated by intellectuals, and coordination and cooperation steadily became
closer as the centuries rolled on. “Gracchus” Babeuf, the leading spirit of the
only purely socialist movement within the French Revolution, was considered
of sufficient importance for the government to pay him the compliment of
executing him in 1797. Again England best illustrates this development. We
need only compare, from this angle, the history of the Leveller movement in
the seventeenth and the Chartist movement in the nineteenth centuries. In the
first case, Winstanley joined and led as an individual; in the second case,
groups of intellectuals reacted in a body and though their cooperation tapered
off into Christian Socialism, it was not merely an affair of the student’s closet
entirely divorced from a contemporaneous mass movement. In France, the best
example is afforded by Louis Blanc’s activities in 1848. In this as in other
respects, therefore, Utopian socialism differed from “scientific” socialism in
degree rather than in kind: the relation of the socialists of the nonage to class
movements was occasional and not as a rule a matter of fundamental principle,
whereas with Marx and with post-Marxian socialism it became precisely a
matter of fundamental principle and similar to the relation of a government
to its standing army.
A very important point—I hope it will not prove a stumbling block—
remains to be made. I have said that the doctrine which avers the presence
of a tendency toward socialism,3 and the permanent contact with an existing
or potential source of social power—the two requisites of socialism as a
serious political factor—were definitely established around the middle of the
nineteenth century in a way that was logically not the only possible one.
Marx and most of his contemporaries imparted a particular slant to their
doctrine by hold ing that the laboring class was the only one to be actively
associated with this tendency and that hence it was the only source of power
for the socialist to tap. For them, socialism meant primarily liberation of
labor from exploitation, and “the emancipation of the workers must be the
task of the working class itself.”
3 For the precise meaning of this phrase the reader should again turn to our discussions in
Parts I and II. Here it means two things: first, that real social forces, independent of
desirabilities or undesirabilities, are making for socialism which therefore will increasingly
acquire the character of a practical proposition; second, that this being so, there is present room
for party activities on socialist lines. The latter point will be discussed in ch. xxv.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties310
Now it is easy to understand why, as a practical proposition, the
conquest of the labor interest should have appealed to Marx more than any
other course, and why his doctrine should have been shaped accordingly.
But the idea has become so firmly rooted, also in some non-socialist minds,
as to blot out completely some facts which it takes a lot of trouble to
explain away, viz., that the labor movement, though often allied with
socialism, has remained distinct from it to this day, and that it proved by
no means so easy for socialists to establish in the workers’ world spheres
of influence in which their creed is accepted as a matter of course.
However we may interpret these facts, it should be clear that the labor
movement is not essentially socialist, just as socialism is not necessarily
laborite or proletarian. Nor is this surprising. For we have seen in Part II
that though the capitalist process slowly socializes economic life and much
besides, this spells transformation of the whole of the social organism all
parts of which are equally affected. The real income and the social weight
of the working class rise in this process, and capitalist society becomes
more and more incapable of dealing with labor difficulties. But this is a
poor substitute for the Marxian picture of labor being goaded into the
grand revolution by increasingly intolerable suffering. If we discard this
picture and realize that what actually increases is labor’s stake in the
capitalist system, we shall inevitably think less of the particular call
addressed to the working class by the logic of evolution. Still less
convincing is the role that Marxism assigns to the proletariat in the
catastrophe of the social drama. There is little for it to do if the
transformation is gradual. And if there be a grand revolution, the proletariat
will simply be talked and bullied into consent. The spearhead will be
formed by intellectuals assisted by the semicriminal rabble. And Marx’s
ideas on the subject are nothing but “ideology”—just as utopian as any
beliefs of the utopists.
Thus, while it remains substantially true that, unlike most of his
predecessors, Marx intended to rationalize an existing movement and not a
dream, and also that he and his successors actually gained partial control of
that movement, the difference is smaller than Marxists would have us
believe. There was, as we have seen, more of realism in the thought of the
utopists, and there was more of unrealistic dreaming in Marx’s thought than
they admit.
In the light of this fact, we shall think better of the socialists of the
nonage because they did not exclusively stress the proletarian aspect. In
particular their appeal to governments or to classes other than the
proletariat will appear to us less visionary and more realistic than it
appeared to Marx. For the state, its bureaucracy and the groups that man
The Nonage 311
the political engine are quite promising prospects for the socialist looking
for his source of social power. As should be evident by now, they are likely
to move in the desired direction with no less “dialectical” necessity than
are the masses. And that excrescence of the bourgeois stratum which we
shall term (a potiori) Fabian Socialism 4 is also suggestive. Marx’s choice
of social motive power thus produced a special case which, though
practically the most important, yet stands logically on a par with others that
are frauds and heresies to the orthodox.
4 See ch. xxvi. Marxists will naturally reply that those phenomena are mere derivates of
the genuine one, mere effects of the forward march of the proletariat. This is true if it means
that the latter is one of the factors in the situation which produced and is producing the former.
But taken in this sense, this proposition does not constitute an objection. If it means that there
is a one-way or purely cause-effect relation between proletarian and state socialism, then it does
constitute an objection but it is wrong. The socio-psychological process described in Part II will,
without any pressure from below, produce state and Fabian socialism which will even help to
produce that pressure. As we shall presently see, it is a fair question to ask where socialism
would be without the fellow traveler. It is certain that socialism (as distinguished from the labor
movement of the trade-union type) would be nowhere without the intellectual leader of
bourgeois extraction.
