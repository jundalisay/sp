WE HAVE now to do a thing which is very objectionable to the faithful.
They naturally resent any application of cold analysis to what for them
is the very fountain of truth. 

But one of the things they resent most is cutting
Marx’s work into pieces and discussing them one by one. They would say
that the very act displays the incapacity of the bourgeois to grasp the
resplendent whole, all parts of which complement and explain one another,
so that the true meaning is missed as soon as any one part or aspect is
considered by itself. We have no choice, however. By committing the offense
and next taking up Marx the sociologist after Marx the prophet, I do not
mean to deny either the presence of a unity of social vision which succeeds
in giving some measure of analytic unity, and still more a semblance of unity,
to the Marxian work, or the fact that every part of it, however independent
intrinsically, has been correlated by the author with every other. Enough
independence remains nevertheless in every province of the vast realm to
make it possible for the student to accept the fruits of his labors in one of
them while rejecting those in another. 

Much of the glamour of the faith is
lost in the process but something is gained by salvaging important and
stimulating truth which is much more valuable by itself than it would be if
tied to hopeless wreckage.

This applies first of all to Marx’s philosophy which we may as well get out
of our way once and for all. German-trained and speculative-minded as he was,
he had a thorough grounding and a passionate interest in philosophy. Pure
philosophy of the German kind was his starting point and the love of his youth.
For a time he thought of it as his true vocation. He was a Neo-Hegelian, which
roughly means that while accepting the master’s fundamental attitudes and
methods he and his group eliminated, and replaced by pretty much their
opposites, the conservative interpretations put upon Hegel’s philosophy by
many of its other adherents. This background shows in all his writings
wherever the opportunity offers itself. It is no wonder that his German and
Russian readers, by bent of mind and training similarly disposed, should seize
primarily upon this element and make it the master key to the system.
I believe this to be a mistake and an injustice to Marx’s scientific powers.
He retained his early love during the whole of his lifetime. He enjoyed
certain formal analogies which may be found between his and Hegel’s argument. 

He liked to testify to his Hegelianism and to use Hegelian
phraseology. But this is all. Nowhere did he betray positive science to
metaphysics. He says himself as much in the preface to the second edition
of the first volume of Das Kapital, and that what he says there is true and
no self-delusion can be proved by analyzing his argument, which everywhere
rests upon social fact, and the true sources of his propositions none of which
lies in the domain of philosophy. Of course, those commentators or critics
who themselves started from the philosophic side were unable to do this
because they did not know enough about the social sciences involved. The
propensity of the philosophic system-builder, moreover, made them averse
to any other interpretation but the one which proceeds from some
philosophic principle. So they saw philosophy in the most matter-of-fact
statements about economic experience, thereby shunting discussion on to the
wrong track, misleading friends and foes alike.

Marx the sociologist brought to bear on his task an equipment which
consisted primarily of an extensive command over historical and
contemporaneous fact. His knowledge of the latter was always somewhat
antiquated, for he was the most bookish of men and therefore fundamental
materials, as distinguished from the material of the newspapers, always reached
him with a lag. But hardly any historical work of his time that was of any
general importance or scope escaped him, although much of the monographic
literature did. While we cannot extol the completeness of his information in
this field as much as we shall his erudition in the field of economic theory, he
was yet able to illustrate his social visions not only by large historical frescoes
but also by many details most of which were as regards reliability rather above
than below the standards of other sociologists of his time. These facts he
embraced with a glance that pierced through the random irregularities of the
surface down to the grandiose logic of things historical. In this there was not
merely passion. There was not merely analytic impulse. There were both. And
the outcome of his attempt to formulate that logic, the so-called Economic
Interpretation of History, 1 is doubtless one of the greatest individual
achievements of sociology to this day. Before it, the question sinks into
insignificance whether or not this achievement was entirely original and how
far credit has in part to be given to predecessors, German and French.


<!-- 1 First published in that scathing attack on Proudhon’s Philosophie de la Misère, entitled
Das Elend der Philosophie, 1847. Another version was included in the Communist
Manifesto, 1848. -->

The economic interpretation of history does not mean that men are,
consciously or unconsciously, wholly or primarily, actuated by economic
motives. On the contrary, the explanation of the role and mechanism of non-
economic motives and the analysis of the way in which social reality mirrors itself in the individual psyches is an essential element of the theory and one of its most significant contributions. Marx did not hold that religions,
metaphysics, schools of art, ethical ideas and political volitions were either
reducible to economic motives or of no importance. He only tried to unveil
the economic conditions which shape them and which account for their rise
and fall. 

The whole of Max Weber’s 2 facts and arguments fits perfectly into
Marx’s system. Social groups and classes and the ways in which these
groups or classes explain to themselves their own existence, location and
behavior were of course what interested him most. He poured the vials of
his most bilious wrath on the historians who took those attitudes and their
verbalizations (the ideologies or, as Pareto would have said, derivations) at
their face value and who tried to interpret social reality by means of them.
But if ideas or values were not for him the prime movers of the social
process, neither were they mere smoke. 

If I may use the analogy, they had
in the social engine the role of transmission belts. We cannot touch upon that
most interesting post-war development of these principles which would
afford the best instance by which to explain this, the Sociology of
Knowledge. 3 But it was necessary to say this much because Marx has been
persistently misunderstood in this respect. Even his friend Engels, at the open
grave of Marx, defined the theory in question as meaning precisely that
individuals and groups are swayed primarily by economic motives, which
in some important respects is wrong and for the rest piteously trivial.
While we are about it, we may as well defend Marx against another
misunderstanding: the economic interpretation of history has often been
called the materialistic interpretation. It has been called so by Marx himself.
This phrase greatly increased its popularity with some, and its unpopularity
with other people. But it is entirely meaningless. Marx’s philosophy is no
more materialistic than is Hegel’s, and his theory of history is not more
materialistic than is any other attempt to account for the historic process by
the means at the command of empirical science. It should be clear that this
is logically compatible with any metaphysical or religious belief—exactly as
any physical picture of the world is. Medieval theology itself supplies
methods by which it is possible to establish this compatibility.4
What the theory really says may be put into two propositions: (1)

<!-- 2 The above refers to Weber’s investigations into the sociology of religions and particularly
to his famous study. Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus, republished in
his collected works.
3 The German word is Wissenssoziologie, and the best names to mention are those of Max
Scheler and Karl Mannheim. The latter’s article on the subject in the German Dictionary of
Sociology (Handwörterbuch der Soziologie) can serve as an introduction. -->

The forms or conditions of production are the fundamental determinant of
social structures which in turn breed attitudes, actions and civilizations. Marx
illustrates his meaning by the famous statement that the “hand-mill” creates
feudal, and the “steam-mill,” capitalist societies. This stresses the
technological element to a dangerous extent, but may be accepted on the
understanding that mere technology is not all of it. Popularizing a little and
recognizing that by doing so we lose much of the meaning, we may say that
it is our daily work which forms our minds, and that it is our location within
the productive process which determines our outlook on things—or the sides
of things we see—and the social elbowroom at the command of each of us.
(2) The forms of production themselves have a logic of their own; that is to
say, they change according to necessities inherent in them so as to produce
their successors merely by their own working. To illustrate by the same
Marxian example: the system characterized by the “hand-mill” creates an
economic and social situation in which the adoption of the mechanical
method of milling becomes a practical necessity that individuals or groups
are powerless to alter. The rise and working of the “steam-mill” in turn
creates new social functions and locations, new groups and views, which
develop and interact in such a way as to outgrow their own frame. Here,
then, we have the propeller which is responsible first of all for economic and,
in consequence of this, for any other social change, a propeller the action
of which does not itself require any impetus external to it.

Both propositions undoubtedly contain a large amount of truth and are,
as we shall find at several turns of our way, invaluable working hypotheses.
Most of the current objections completely fail, all those for instance which
in refutation point to the influence of ethical or religious factors, or the one
already raised by Eduard Bernstein, which with delightful simplicity asserts
that “men have heads” and can hence act as they choose. After what has been
said above, it is hardly necessary to dwell on the weakness of such
arguments: of course men “choose” their course of action which is not
directly enforced by the objective data of the environment; but they choose
from standpoints, views and propensities that do not form another set of
independent data but are themselves molded by the objective set.

Nevertheless, the question arises whether the economic interpretation of
history is more than a convenient approximation which must be expected to
work less satisfactorily in some cases than it does in others. An obvious
qualification occurs at the outset. Social structures, types and attitudes are
coins that do not readily melt. Once they are formed they persist, possibly
for centuries, and since different structures and types display different
degrees of this ability to survive, we almost always find that actual group
and national behavior more or less departs from what we should expect it to be if we tried to infer it from the dominant forms of the productive
process. Though this applies quite generally, it is most clearly seen when a
highly durable structure transfers itself bodily from one country to another.

The social situation created in Sicily by the Norman conquest will illustrate
my meaning. Such facts Marx did not overlook but he hardly realized all
their implications.

A related case is of more ominous significance. Consider the emergence
of the feudal type of landlordism in the kingdom of the Franks during the
sixth and seventh centuries. This was certainly a most important event that
shaped the structure of society for many ages and also influenced conditions
of production, wants and technology included. But its simplest explanation
is to be found in the function of military leadership previously filled by the
families and individuals who (retaining that function however) became feudal
landlords after the definitive conquest of the new territory. This does not fit
the Marxian schema at all well and could easily be so construed as to point
in a different direction. Facts of this nature can no doubt also be brought into
the fold by means of auxiliary hypotheses but the necessity of inserting such
hypotheses is usually the beginning of the end of a theory.

Many other difficulties that arise in the course of attempts at historical
interpretation by means of the Marxian schema could be met by admitting
some measure of interaction between the sphere of production and other
spheres of social life. 5 But the glamour of fundamental truth that surrounds
it depends precisely on the strictness and simplicity of the one-way relation
which it asserts. If this be called in question, the economic interpretation of
history will have to take its place among other propositions of a similar
kind—as one of many partial truths—or else to give way to another that does
tell more fundamental truth. However, neither its rank as an achievement nor
its handiness as a working hypothesis is impaired thereby.
To the faithful, of course, it is simply the master key to all the secrets of
human history. And if we sometimes feel inclined to smile at rather naïve
applications of it, we should remember what sort of arguments it replaced.
Even the crippled sister of the economic interpretation of history, the
Marxian Theory of Social Classes, moves into a more favorable light as soon
as we bear this in mind.

Economists have been strangely slow in recognizing social classes.

They always classified the agents whose interplay produced the processes they dealt with. But these classes were simply sets
of individuals that displayed some common character: thus, some people
<!-- 5 In his later life, Engels admitted that freely. Plekhanov went still further in this
direction. -->

were classed as landlords or workmen because they owned land or sold the
services of their labor. Social classes, however, are not the creatures of the
classifying observer but live entities that exist as such. And their existence
entails consequences that are entirely missed by a schema which looks upon
society as if it were an amorphous assemblage of individuals or families. It is
fairly open to question precisely how important the phenomenon of social
classes is for research in the field of purely economic theory. That it is very
important for many practical applications and for all the broader aspects of the
social process in general is beyond doubt.

Roughly speaking, we may say that the social classes made their entrance
in the famous statement contained in the Communist Manifesto that the history
of society is the history of class struggles. Of course, this is to put the claim
at its highest. But even if we tone it down to the proposition that historical
events may often be interpreted in terms of class interests and class attitudes
and that existing class structures are always an important factor in historical
interpretation, enough remains to entitle us to speak of a conception nearly as
valuable as was the-economic interpretation of history itself.

Clearly, success on the line of advance opened up by the principle of class
struggle depends upon the validity of the particular theory of classes we
make our own. Our picture of history and all our interpretations of cultural
patterns and the mechanism of social change will differ according to whether
we choose, for instance, the racial theory of classes and like Gobineau reduce
human history to the history of the struggle of races or, say, the division of
labor theory of classes in the fashion of Schmoller or of Durkheim and
resolve class antagonisms into antagonisms between the interests of
vocational groups. Nor is the range of possible differences in analysis
confined to the problem of the nature of classes. Whatever view we may hold
about it, different interpretations will result from different definitions of class
interest 6 and from different opinions about how class action manifests itself.

The subject is a hot-bed of prejudice to this day, and as yet hardly in its
scientific stage.

Curiously enough, Marx has never, as far as we know, worked out
systematically what it is plain was one of the pivots of his thought. It is
possible that he deferred the task until it was too late, precisely because his
thinking ran so much in terms of class concepts that he did not feel it
necessary to bother about definitive statement at all. It is equally possible that some points about it remained unsettled in his own mind, and that his
way toward a full-fledged theory of classes was barred by certain difficulties
he had created for himself by insisting on a purely economic and over-
simplified conception of the phenomenon. He himself and his disciples both
offered applications of this under-developed theory to particular patterns of
which his own History of the Class Struggles in France is the outstanding
example. 7 Beyond that no real progress has been achieved. The theory of his
chief associate, Engels, was of the division of labor type and essentially un-
Marxian in its implications. Barring this we have only the sidelights and
aperçus—some of them of striking force and brilliance—that are strewn all
over the writings of the master, particularly in Das Kapital and the
Communist Manifesto.

<!-- 6 The reader will perceive that one’s views about what classes are and about what calls them
into existence do not uniquely determine what the interests of those classes are and how each
class will act on what “it”—its leaders for instance or the rank and file—considers or feels, in
the long run or in the short, erroneously or correctly, to be its interest or interests. The problem
of group interest is full of thorns and pitfalls of its own, quite irrespective of the nature of the
groups under study. -->


The task of piecing together such fragments is delicate and cannot be
attempted here. The basic idea is clear enough, however. The stratifying
principle consists in the ownership, or the exclusion from ownership, of
means of production such as factory buildings, machinery, raw materials and
the consumers’ goods that enter into the workman’s budget. We have thus,
fundamentally, two and only two classes, those owners, the capitalists, and
those have-nots who are compelled to sell their labor, the laboring class or
proletariat. The existence of intermediate groups, such as are formed by
farmers or artisans who employ labor but also do manual work, by clerks
and by the professions is of course not denied; but they are treated as
anomalies which tend to disappear in the course of the capitalist process. The
two fundamental classes are, by virtue of the logic of their position and quite
independently of any individual volition, essentially antagonistic to each
other. Rifts within each class and collisions between subgroups occur and
may even have historically decisive importance. But in the last analysis, such
rifts or collisions are incidental. The one antagonism that is not incidental
but inherent in the basic design of capitalist society is founded upon the
private control over the means to produce: the very nature of the relation
between the capitalist class and the proletariat is strife—class war.
As we shall see presently, Marx tries to show how in that class war
capitalists destroy each other and eventually will destroy the capitalist system
too. He also tries to show how the ownership of capital leads to further
accumulation. But this way of arguing as well as the very definition that makes
the ownership of something the constituent characteristic of a social class only
serves to increase the importance of the question of “primitive accumulation,”

<!-- 7 Another example is the socialist theory of imperialism which will be noticed later on.
O.Bauer’s interesting attempt to interpret the antagonisms between the various races that
inhabited the Austro-Hungarian Empire in terms of the class struggle between capitalists and
workers (Die Nationalitätenfrage, 1905) also deserves to be mentioned, although the skill of
the analyst only serves to show up the inadequacy of the tool. -->


that is to say, of the question how capitalists came to be capitalists in the first
instance or how they acquired that stock of goods which according to the
Marxian doctrine was necessary in order to enable them to start exploiting. On
this question Marx is much less explicit. 8 He contemptuously rejects the
bourgeois nursery tale (Kinderfibel) that some people rather than others
became, and are still becoming every day, capitalists by superior intelligence
and energy in working and saving. Now he was well advised to sneer at that
story about the good boys. For to call for a guffaw is no doubt an excellent
method of disposing of an uncomfortable truth, as every politician knows to
his profit. Nobody who looks at historical and contemporaneous fact with
anything like an unbiased mind can fail to observe that this children’s tale,
while far from telling the whole truth, yet tells a good deal of it. Supernormal
intelligence and energy account for industrial success and in particular for the
founding of industrial positions in nine cases out of ten. And precisely in the
initial stages of capitalism and of every individual industrial career, saving was
and is an important element in the process though not quite as explained in
classic economics. It is true that one does not ordinarily attain the status of
capitalist (industrial employer) by saving from a wage or salary in order to
equip one’s factory by means of the fund thus assembled. The bulk of
accumulation comes from profits and hence presupposes profits—this is in fact
the sound reason for distinguishing saving from accumulating. The means
required in order to start enterprise are typically provided by borrowing other
people’s savings, the presence of which in many small puddles is easy to
explain or the deposits which banks create for the use of the would-be
entrepreneur. Nevertheless, the latter does save as a rule: the function of his
saving is to raise him above the necessity of submitting to daily drudgery for
the sake of his daily bread and to give him breathing space in order to look
around, to develop his plans and to secure cooperation. As a matter of
economic theory, therefore, Marx had a real case—though he overstated it—
when he denied to saving the role that the classical authors attributed to it.
Only his inference does not follow. And the guffaw is hardly more justified
than it would be if the classical theory were correct.9

The guffaw did its work, however, and helped to clear the road for Marx’s
alternative theory of primitive accumulation. But this alternative theory is not

<!-- 8 See Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xxvi: “The Secret of Primitive Accumulation.”
9 I will not stay to stress, though I must mention, that even the classical theory is not as
wrong as Marx pretended it was. “Saving up” in the most literal sense has been, especially in
earlier stages of capitalism, a not unimportant method of “original accumulation.” Moreover,
there was another method that was akin to it though not identical with Many a factory in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was just a shed that a man was able to put up by the work
of his hands, and required only the simplest equipment to work it. In such cases the manual
work of the prospective capitalist plus a quite small fund of savings was all that was needed—
and brains, of course. -->

as definite as we might wish. Force—robbery—subjugation of the masses
facilitating their spoliation and the results of the pillage in turn facilitating
subjugation—this was all right of course and admirably tallied with ideas
common among intellectuals of all types, in our day still more than in the
day of Marx. But evidently it does not solve the problem, which is to explain
how some people acquired the power to subjugate and to rob. Popular
literature does not worry about it. I should not think of addressing the
question to the writings of John Reed. But we are dealing with Marx.
Now at least the semblance of a solution is afforded by the historical
quality of all the major theories of Marx. For him, it is essential for the logic
of capitalism, and not only a matter of fact, that it grew out of a feudal state
of society. Of course the same question about the causes and the mechanism
of social stratification arises also in this case, but Marx substantially accepted
the bourgeois view that feudalism was a reign of force 10 in which subjugation
and exploitation of the masses were already accomplished facts. The class
theory devised primarily for the conditions of capitalist society was extended
to its feudal predecessor—as was much of the conceptual apparatus of the
economic theory of capitalism 11 —and some of the most thorny problems
were stowed away in the feudal compound to reappear in a settled state, in
the form of data, in the analysis of the capitalist pattern. The feudal exploiter
was simply replaced by the capitalist exploiter. In those cases in which feudal
lords actually turned into industrialists, this alone would solve what is thus
left of the problem. Historical evidence lends a certain amount of support
to this view: many feudal lords, particularly in Germany, in fact did erect
and run factories, often providing the financial means from their feudal rents
and the labor from the agricultural population (not necessarily but sometimes
their serfs). 12 In all other cases the material available to stop the gap is
distinctly inferior. The only frank way of expressing the situation is that from
a Marxian standpoint there is no satisfactory explanation, that is to say, no
explanation without resorting to non-Marxian elements suggestive of non-

<!-- 10 Many socialist writers besides Marx have displayed that uncritical confidence in the
explanatory value of the element of force and of the control over the physical means with which
to exert force. Ferdinand Lassalle, for instance, has little beyond cannons and bayonets to offer
by way of explanation of governmental authority. It is a source of wonder to me that so many
people should be blind to the weakness of such a sociology and to the fact that it would
obviously be much truer to say that power leads to control over cannons (and men willing to
use them) than that control over cannons generates power.
11 This constitutes one of the affinities of the teaching of Marx to that of K.
Rodbertus.
12 W.Sombart, in the first edition of his Theorie des modernen Kapitalismus, tried to
make the most of those cases. But the attempt to base primitive accumu lation entirely
on the accumulation of ground rent showed its hopelessness as Sombart himself
eventually recognized. -->


This, however, vitiates the theory at both its historical and its logical
source. Since most of the methods of primitive accumulation also account
for later accumulation—primitive accumulation, as it were, continues
throughout the capitalist era—it is not possible to say that Marx’s theory of
social classes is all right except for the difficulties about processes in a distant
past. But it is perhaps superfluous to insist on the shortcomings of a theory
which not even in the most favorable instances goes anywhere near the heart
of the phenomenon it undertakes to explain, and which never should have
been taken seriously. These instances are to be found mainly in that epoch
of capitalist evolution which derived its character from the prevalence of the
medium-sized owner-managed firm. Beyond the range of that type, class
positions, though in most cases reflected in more or less corresponding
economic positions, are more often the cause than the consequence of the
latter: business achievement is obviously not everywhere the only avenue to
social eminence and only where it is can ownership of means of production
causally determine a group’s position in the social structure. Even then,
however, it is as reasonable to make that ownership the defining element as
it would be to define a soldier as a man who happens to have a gun. The
water-tight division between people who (together with their descendants)
are supposed to be capitalists once for all and others who (together with their
descendants) are supposed to be proletarians once for all is not only, as has
often been pointed out, utterly unrealistic but it misses the salient point about
social classes—the incessant rise and fall of individual families into and out
of the upper strata. The facts I am alluding to are all obvious and
indisputable. If they do not show on the Marxian canvas, the reason can only
be in their un-Marxian implications.

It is not superfluous, however, to consider the role which that theory plays
within Marx’s structure and to ask ourselves what analytic intention—as
distinguished from its use as a piece of equipment for the agitator—he meant
it to serve.

On the one hand, we must bear in mind that for Marx the theory of Social
Classes and the Economic Interpretation of History were not what they are
for us, viz., two independent doctrines. With Marx, the former implements
the latter in a particular way and thus restricts—makes more definite—the
modus operandi of the conditions or forms of production. These determine
the social structure and, through the social structure, all manifestations of

<!-- 13 This holds true even if we admit robbery to the utmost extent to which it is possible to
do so without trespassing upon the sphere of the intellectual’s folklore. Robbery actually entered
into the building up of commercial capital at many times and places. Phoenician as well as
English wealth offers familiar examples. But even then the Marxian explanation is inadequate
because in the last resort successful robbery must rest on the personal superiority of the robbers.
And as soon as this is admitted, a very different theory of social stratification suggests itself. -->


civilization and the whole march of cultural and political history. But the
social structure is, for all non-socialist epochs, defined in terms of classes—
those two classes—which are the true dramatis personae and at the same time
the only immediate creatures of the logic of the capitalist system of
production which affects everything else through them. This explains why
Marx was forced to make his classes purely economic phenomena, and even
phenomena that were economic in a very narrow sense: he thereby cut
himself off from a deeper view of them, but in the precise spot of his analytic
schema in which he placed them he had no choice but to do so.
On the other hand, Marx wished to define capitalism by the same trait
that also defines his class division. A little reflection will convince the
reader that this is not a necessary or natural thing to do. In fact it was a
bold stroke of analytic strategy which linked the fate of the class
phenomenon with the fate of capitalism in such a way that socialism,
which in reality has nothing to do with the presence or absence of social
classes, became, by definition, the only possible kind of classless society,
excepting primitive groups. This ingenious tautology could not equally
well have been secured by any definitions of classes and of capitalism
other than those chosen by Marx—the definition by private ownership of
means of production. Hence there had to be just two classes, owners and
non-owners, and hence all other principles of division, much more
plausible ones among them, had to be severely neglected or discounted
or else reduced to that one.

The exaggeration of the definiteness and importance of the dividing line
between the capitalist class in that sense and the proletariat was surpassed
only by the exaggeration of the antagonism between them. To any mind not
warped by the habit of fingering the Marxian rosary it should be obvious
that their relation is, in normal times, primarily one of cooperation and that
any theory to the contrary must draw largely on pathological cases for
verification. In social life, antagonism and synagogism are of course both
ubiquitous and in fact inseparable except in the rarest of cases. But I am
almost tempted to say that there was, if anything, less of absolute nonsense
in the old harmonistic view—full of nonsense though that was too—than in
the Marxian construction of the impassable gulf between tool owners and
tool users. Again, however, he had no choice, not because he wanted to arrive
at revolutionary results—these he could have derived just as well from
dozens of other possible schemata—but because of the requirements of his
own analysis. If class struggle was the subject matter of history and also the
means of bringing about the socialist dawn, and if there had to be just those
two classes, then their relation had to be antagonistic on principle or else the
force in his system of social dynamics would have been lost.


Though Marx defines capitalism sociologically, i.e., by the institution
of private control over means of production, the mechanics of capitalist
society are provided by his economic theory. This economic theory is to
show how the sociological data embodied in such conceptions as class, class
interest, class behavior, exchange between classes, work out through the
medium of economic values, profits, wages, investment, etc., and how they
generate precisely the economic process that will eventually break its own
institutional framework and at the same time create the conditions for the
emergence of another social world. This particular theory of social classes
is the analytic tool which, by linking the economic interpretation of history
with the concepts of the profit economy, marshals all social facts, makes all
phenomena confocal. 

It is therefore not simply a theory of an individual
phenomenon which is to explain that phenomenon and nothing else. It has
an organic function which is really much more important to the Marxian
system than the measure of success with which it solves its immediate
problem. This function must be seen if we are to understand how an analyst
of the power of Marx could ever have borne with its shortcomings.
There are, and always have been, some enthusiasts who admired the
Marxian theory of social classes as such. But far more understandable are
the feelings of all those who admire the force and grandeur of that synthesis
as a whole to the point of being ready to condone almost any number of
shortcomings in the component parts. We shall try to appraise it for ourselves
(Chapter IV). But first we must see how Marx’s economic mechanics acquits
itself of the task that his general plan imposes upon it.
