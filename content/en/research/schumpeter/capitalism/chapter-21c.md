It remains to answer our question about the definiteness and independence
of the voter’s will, his powers of observation and interpretation of facts, and
his ability to draw, clearly and promptly, rational inferences from both. This
subject belongs to a chapter of social psychology that might be entitled


During the second half of the last century, the idea of the human
personality that is a homogeneous unit and the idea of a definite will that is
the prime mover of action have been steadily fading—even before the times
of Théodule Ribot and of Sigmund Freud. 

In particular, these ideas have
been increasingly discounted in the field of social sciences where the
importance of the extra-rational and irrational element in our behavior has
been receiving more and more attention, witness Pareto’s Mind and Society.
Of the many sources of the evidence that accumulated against the hypothesis
of rationality, I shall mention only two.

The one—in spite of much more careful later work—may still be
associated with the name of Gustave Le Bon, the founder or, at any rate, the
6 Other instances could in fact be adduced from Napoleon’s practice. He was an autocrat
who, whenever his dynastic interests and his foreign policy were not concerned, simply strove
to do what he conceived the people wanted or needed. 

This is what the advice amounted to
which he gave to Eugène Beauharnais concerning the latter’s administration of northern Italy.
7 This is the title of the frank and charming book by one of the most lovable English radicals
who ever lived, Graham Wallas. In spite of all that has since been written on the subject and
especially in spite of all the detailed case studies that now make it possible to see so much
more clearly, that book may still be recommended as the best introduction to political
psychology. Yet, after having stated with admirable honesty the case against the uncritical
acceptance of the classical doctrine, the author fails to draw the obvious conclusion. 

This is
all the more remarkable because he rightly insists on the necessity of a scientific attitude of
mind and because he does not fail to take Lord Bryce to task for having, in his book on the
American commonwealth, professed himself “grimly” resolved to see some blue sky in the
midst of clouds of disillusioning facts. Why, so Graham Wallas seems to exclaim, what should
we say of a meteorologist who insisted from the outset that he saw some blue sky? Nevertheless
in the constructive part of his book he takes much the same ground.

first effective exponent of the psychology of crowds (psychologie des
foules). 

8 By showing up, though overstressing, the realities of human
behavior when under the influence of agglomeration—in particular the
sudden disappearance, in a state of excitement, of moral restraints and
civilized modes of thinking and feeling, the sudden eruption of primitive
impulses, infantilisms and criminal propensities—he made us face gruesome
facts that everybody knew but nobody wished to see and he thereby dealt a
serious blow to the picture of man’s nature which underlies the classical
doctrine of democracy and democratic folklore about revolutions. No doubt
there is much to be said about the narrowness of the factual basis of Le
Bon’s inferences which, for instance, do not fit at all well the normal
behavior of an English or Anglo-American crowd. 

Critics, especially those
to whom the implications of this branch of social psychology were
uncongenial, did not fail to make the most of its vulnerable points. But on
the other hand it must not be forgotten that the phenomena of crowd
psychology are by no means confined to mobs rioting in the narrow streets
of a Latin town. Every parliament, every committee, every council of war
composed of a dozen generals in their sixties, displays, in however mild a
form, some of those features that stand out so glaringly in the case of the
rabble, in particular a reduced sense of responsibility, a lower level of energy
of thought and greater sensitiveness to non-logical influences. Moreover,
those phenomena are not confined to a crowd in the sense of a physical
agglomeration of many people. Newspaper readers, radio audiences,
members of a party even if not physically gathered together are terribly easy
to work up into a psychological crowd and into a state of frenzy in which
attempt at rational argument only spurs the animal spirits.

The other source of disillusioning evidence that I am going to mention
is a much humbler one—no blood flows from it, only nonsense. Economists,
learning to observe their facts more closely, have begun to discover that, even
in the most ordinary currents of daily life, their consumers do not quite live
up to the idea that the economic textbook used to convey. On the one hand
their wants are nothing like as definite and their actions upon those wants
nothing like as rational and prompt. On the other hand they are so amenable
to the influence of advertising and other methods of persuasion that
producers often seem to dictate to them instead of being directed by them.
The technique of successful advertising is particularly instructive. There is
indeed nearly always some appeal to reason. But mere assertion, often

<!-- 8 The German term, Massenpsychologie, suggests a warning: the psychology of crowds must
not be confused with the psychology of the masses. The former does not necessarily carry any
class connotation and in itself has nothing to do with a study of the ways of thinking and feeling
of, say, the working class. -->

repeated, counts more than rational argument and so does the direct attack
upon the subconscious which takes the form of attempts to evoke and
crystallize pleasant associations of an entirely extra-rational, very frequently
of a sexual nature.

The conclusion, while obvious, must be drawn with care. In the ordinary
run of often repeated decisions the individual is subject to the salutary and
rationalizing influence of favorable and unfavorable experience. He is also
under the influence of relatively simple and unproblematical motives and
interests which are but occasionally interfered with by excitement.
Historically, the consumers’ desire for shoes may, at least in part, have been
shaped by the action of producers offering attractive footgear and
campaigning for it; yet at any given time it is a genuine want, the definiteness
of which extends beyond “shoes in general” and which prolonged
experimenting clears of much of the irrationalities that may originally have
surrounded it. 9 Moreover, under the stimulus of those simple motives
consumers learn to act upon unbiased expert advice about some things
(houses, motorcars) and themselves become experts in others. It is simply
not true that housewives are easily fooled in the matter of foods, familiar
household articles, wearing apparel. And, as every salesman knows to his
cost, most of them have a way of insisting on the exact article they want.
This of course holds true still more obviously on the producers’ side of the
picture. No doubt, a manufacturer may be indolent, a bad judge of opportunities
or otherwise incompetent; but there is an effective mechanism that will reform
or eliminate him. Again Taylorism rests on the fact that man may perform simple
handicraft operations for thousands of years and yet perform them inefficiently.
But neither the intention to act as rationally as possible nor a steady pressure
toward rationality can seriously be called into question at whatever level of
industrial or commercial activity we choose to look.10

And so it is with most of the decisions of daily life that lie within the little
field which the individual citizen’s mind encompasses with a full sense of
its reality. Roughly, it consists of the things that directly concern himself,
his family, his business dealings, his hobbies, his friends and enemies, his
township or ward, his class, church, trade union or any other social group
9 In the above passage irrationality means failure to act rationally upon a given wish. It does
not refer to the reasonableness of the wish itself in the opinion of the observer. This is important
to note because economists in appraising the extent of consumers’ irrationality sometimes
exaggerate it by confusing the two things. Thus, a factory girl’s finery may seem to a professor
an indication of irrational behavior for which there is no other explanation but the advertiser’s
arts. Actually, it may be all she craves for. If so her expenditure on it may be ideally rational
in the above sense.

<!-- 10 This level differs of course not only as between epochs and places but also, at a given
time and place, as between different industrial sectors and classes. There is no such thing as a
universal pattern of rationality. -->

of which he is an active member—the things under his personal observation,
the things which are familiar to him independently of what his newspaper
tells him, which he can directly influence or manage and for which he
develops the kind of responsibility that is induced by a direct relation to the
favorable or unfavorable effects of a course of action.
