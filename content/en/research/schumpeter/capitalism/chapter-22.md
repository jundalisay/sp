## 1. Competition For Political Leadership

Most students of politics have by accepted the criticisms on the classical doctrine of democracy in the preceding chapter.

Most of them accept another theory which is much truer to life and at the same time salvages much of
what sponsors of the democratic method really mean by this term. Like the
classical theory, it may be put into the nutshell of a definition.

Our chief troubles about the classical theory
centered in the proposition that “the people” hold a definite and rational
opinion about every individual question and that they give effect to this
opinion—in a democracy—by choosing “representatives” who will see to it
that that opinion is carried out. 

Thus the selection of the representatives is
made secondary to the primary purpose of the democratic arrangement which
is to vest the power of deciding political issues in the electorate. Suppose
we reverse the roles of these two elements and make the deciding of issues
by the electorate secondary to the election of the men who are to do the
deciding. 

To put it differently, we now take the view that the role of the
people is to produce a government, or else an intermediate body which in
turn will produce a national executive 1 or government. And we define: the
democratic method is that institutional arrangement for arriving at political
decisions in which individuals acquire the power to decide by means of a
competitive struggle for the people’s vote.

Defense and explanation of this idea will speedily show that, as to both
plausibility of assumptions and tenability of propositions, it greatly improves
the theory of the democratic process.

First of all, we are provided with a reasonably efficient criterion by which
to distinguish democratic governments from others. We have seen that the
classical theory meets with difficulties on that score because both the will and
the good of the people may be, and in many historical instances have been,

<!-- 1 The insincere word “executive” really points in the wrong direction. It ceases however to
do so if we use it in the sense in which we speak of the “executives” of a business corporation
who also do a great deal more than “execute” the will of stockholders. -->

served just as well or better by governments that cannot be described as
democratic according to any accepted usage of the term. Now we are in a
somewhat better position partly because we are resolved to stress a modus
procedendi the presence or absence of which it is in most cases easy to verify.2
For instance, a parliamentary monarchy like the English one fulfills the
requirements of the democratic method because the monarch is practically
constrained to appoint to cabinet office the same people as parliament would
elect. A “constitutional” monarchy does not qualify to be called democratic
because electorates and parliaments, while having all the other rights that
electorates and parliaments have in parliamentary monarchies, lack the power
to impose their choice as to the governing committee: the cabinet ministers
are in this case servants of the monarch, in substance as well as in name,
and can in principle be dismissed as well as appointed by him. Such an
arrangement may satisfy the people. The electorate may reaffirm this fact by
voting against any proposal for change. The monarch may be so popular as
to be able to defeat any competition for the supreme office. But since no
machinery is provided for making this competition effective the case does
not come within our definition.

Second, the theory embodied in this definition leaves all the room we may
wish to have for a proper recognition of the vital fact of leadership. The
classical theory did not do this but, as we have seen, attributed to the electorate
an altogether unrealistic degree of initiative which practically amounted to
ignoring leadership. But collectives act almost exclusively by accepting
leadership—this is the dominant mechanism of practically any collective action
which is more than a reflex. Propositions about the working and the results
of the democratic method that take account of this are bound to be infinitely
more realistic than propositions which do not. They will not stop at the
execution of a volonté générale but will go some way toward showing how it
emerges or how it is substituted or faked. What we have termed Manufactured
Will is no longer outside the theory, an aberration for the absence of which
we piously pray; it enters on the ground floor as it should.

Third, however, so far as there are genuine group-wise volitions at all—
for instance the will of the unemployed to receive unemployment benefit or
the will of other groups to help—our theory does not neglect them. On the
contrary we are now able to insert them in exactly the role they actually play.
Such volitions do not as a rule assert themselves directly. Even if strong and
definite they remain latent, often for decades, until they are called to life by
some political leader who turns them into political factors. This he does, or
else his agents do it for him, by organizing these volitions, by working them up and by including eventually appropriate items in his competitive offering.

The interaction between sectional interests and public opinion and the way
in which they produce the pattern we call the political situation appear from
this angle in a new and much clearer light.

4. My theory is no more definite than is the concept of competition for leadership. 

This concept presents similar difficulties as the
concept of competition in the economic sphere, with which it may be
usefully compared. In economic life competition is never completely lacking,
but hardly ever is it perfect. 3 Similarly, in political life there is always some
competition, though perhaps only a potential one, for the allegiance of the
people. To simplify matters we have restricted the kind of competition for
leadership which is to define democracy, to free competition for a free vote.
The justification for this is that democracy seems to imply a recognized
method by which to conduct the competitive struggle, and that the electoral
method is practically the only one available for communities of any size. But
though this excludes many ways of securing leadership which should be
excluded, 4 such as competition by military insurrection, it does not exclude
the cases that are strikingly analogous to the economic phenomena we label
“unfair” or “fraudulent” competition or restraint of competition. And we
cannot exclude them because if we did we should be left with a completely
unrealistic ideal. 5 Between this ideal case which does not exist and the cases
in which all competition with the established leader is prevented by force,
there is a continuous range of variation within which the democratic method
of government shades off into the autocratic one by imperceptible steps. But
if we wish to understand and not to philosophize, this is as it should be. The
value of our criterion is not seriously impaired thereby.

5. My theory clarifies the relation between democracy and individual freedom.

 If by the latter we mean the existence
of a sphere of individual self-government the boundaries of which are
historically variable—no society tolerates absolute freedom even of
conscience and of speech, no society reduces that sphere to zero—the
question clearly becomes a matter of degree. 



<!-- 3 In Part II we had examples of the problems which arise out of this.
4 It also excludes methods which should not be excluded, for instance, the acquisition of
political leadership by the people’s tacit acceptance of it or by election quasi per inspirationem.
The latter differs from election by voting only by a technicality. But the former is not quite
without importance even in modern politics; the sway held by a party boss within his party is
often based on nothing but tacit acceptance of his leadership. Comparatively speaking however
these are details which may, I think, be neglected in a sketch like this.
5 As in the economic field, some restrictions are implicit in the legal and moral principles
of the community. -->

The democratic method does not necessarily guarantee a greater amount of individual freedom than another political method would permit in similar
circumstances. 

It may well be the other way round. But there is still a
relation between the two. If, on principle at least, everyone is free to compete
for political leadership 6 by presenting himself to the electorate, this will in
most cases though not in all mean a considerable amount of freedom of
discussion for all. In particular it will normally mean a considerable amount
of freedom of the press. This relation between democracy and freedom is
not absolutely stringent and can be tampered with. But, from the standpoint
of the intellectual, it is nevertheless very important. At the same time, it is
all there is to that relation.

6. I believe the primary function of the electorate is to produce and evict a government.

<!-- The one means simply the acceptance of a leader or a group of leaders,
the other means simply the withdrawal of this acceptance. This takes care
of an element the reader may have missed. He may have thought that the
electorate controls as well as installs. But since electorates normally do not
control their political leaders in any way except by refusing to reelect them
or the parliamentary majorities that support them, it seems well to reduce
our ideas about this control in the way indicated by our definition. -->

Occasionally, spontaneous revulsions occur which upset a government or
an individual minister directly or else enforce a certain course of action.
But they are not only exceptional, they are, as we shall see, contrary to the
spirit of the democratic method.

7. My theory sheds much-needed light on an old controversy.

Whoever accepts the classical doctrine of democracy and in consequence
believes that the democratic method is to guarantee that issues be decided
and policies framed according to the will of the people must be struck by
the fact that, even if that will were undeniably real and definite, decision by
simple majorities would in many cases distort it rather than give effect to it.

Evidently the will of the majority is the will of the majority and not the will of “the people.” The latter is a mosaic that the former completely fails to “represent.” To equate both by definition is not to solve the problem. Attempts at real solutions have however been made by the authors of the various plans for Proportional Representation.

These plans have met with adverse criticism on practical grounds. It is
in fact obvious not only that proportional representation will offer
opportunities for all sorts of idiosyncrasies to assert themselves but also that

<!-- 6 Free, that is, in the same sense in which everyone is free to start another textile mill.

F.A.Hermens in “The Trojan Horse of Democracy,” Social Research, November 1938. -->


it may prevent democracy from producing efficient governments and thus
prove a danger in times of stress. 7 

But before concluding that democracy becomes unworkable it its principle is carried out consistently, it is just as well to ask ourselves whether this principle really implies proportional representation. As a matter of fact it does not. If acceptance of leadership is the true function of the electorate’s vote, the case for proportional representation collapses because its premises are no longer binding. The principle of democracy then merely means that the reins of government should be handed to those who command more support than do any of the competing individuals or teams. And this in turn seems to assure the standing of the majority system within the logic of the democratic method, although we might still condemn it on grounds that lie outside of that logic.
