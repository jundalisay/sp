<!-- IV. The French Case ASE ANALYSIS Of SYNDICALISM -->

What syndicalism really is we shall see best in the French picture. 16 Before
attempting to do so we shall briefly note a few things about French
socialism in general.

First, its ideological history goes further back and is perhaps more
distinguished than that of any other. But no single variety of it ever
crystallized so completely and commanded allegiance so widely as did the
socialism of, say, the Fabian type on the one hand and of the Marxian on
the other. 

Fabian socialism requires English political society, and nothing
like that developed in France—the great revolution and the subsequent
failure of the aristocratic and the bourgeois elements to coalesce prevented
it. Marxian socialism requires a broad and unified labor movement; or, as
a rallying creed for intellectuals, it requires cultural traditions quite
uncongenial to French limpidité. But all the other socialist creeds that have
so far emerged appeal only to particular mentalities and social locations
and are sectarian by nature.

Second, France was typically the country of the peasant, the artisan, the
clerk and the small rentier. Capitalist evolution proceeded by measured steps
and large-scale industry was confined to a few centers. Whatever the issues
that divided these classes, they were economically conservative at first—
nowhere else did conservatism rest on so broad a basis—and later on lent
16 Italian and Spanish syndicalism would do almost equally well. Only, in proportion to the
number of illiterates, the anarchist element increases so much as to distort what I believe to
be the true traits. This element has its place. But it should not be overemphasized.

From 1875 to 1914 337
increasing support to groups that sponsored middle-class reform, among
them the radicaux-socialistes, a party that can be best described by saying
that it was neither radical nor socialist. Many workmen were of the same
sociological type and of the same mind. Many professionals and intellectuals
adapted themselves to it, which accounts for the fact that over-production
and under-employment of intellectuals, though it existed, failed to assert
itself as we should otherwise expect. 

Unrest there was. But among the
malcontents, the Catholics, who disapproved of the anti-clerical tendencies
that various circumstances brought to the fore in the Third Republic, were
more important than the people who were displeased with the capitalist order
of things. It was from the former and not from the latter that the real danger
to the bourgeois republic arose at the time of the affaire Dreyfus.
Third, it follows that, though again for different reasons, there was not
much more scope for serious socialism in France than there was in Russia
or the United States. 

Hence she had a variety of socialisms and quasi-
socialisms that were not serious. The Blanquist party whose hope was the
action of “a few resolute men” may serve as an example: a small band of
intellectuals with a bent for conspiracy and professional revolutionists
together with the mob of Paris and two or three other big towns was all
that ever came within the horizon of groups like that. Eventually however
a Marxist parti ouvrier was founded by Guesde and Lafargue with a class-
war program (1883) that had received the sanction of Marx himself. It
developed on orthodox lines, fighting putschism of the Hervé type and
anarchism on the one front and Jaurès’ reformism on the other, much as
its German counterpart did. But it never acquired similar importance and
never meant nearly as much either to the masses or to the intellectuals, in
spite of the merger of socialist groups in the chambre which was achieved
in 1893 (48 seats as compared with the 300 occupied by governmental
republicans) and eventually led to the formation of the Unified Socialist
party (1905).

Fourth, I will simply state the fact, without attempting to go behind it,
that the social pattern glanced at above precluded the emergence of great and
disciplined parties of the English type. Instead, as every one knows,
parliamentary politics became a cotillon of small and unstable groups that
combined and dissolved in response to momentary situations and individual
interests and intrigues, setting up and pulling down cabinets according to the
principles, as I put it before, of a parlor game. One of the consequences of
this was governmental inefficiency. Another was that cabinet office came
within the sight of socialist and quasi-socialist groups sooner than it did in
countries whose socialist parties were much more powerful but whose
politics were run according to somewhat more rational methods. 

Until the national emergency of 1914, Guesde and his group proved impervious to the
temptation and consistently refused cooperation with bourgeois parties in the
best orthodox style. But the reformist group which in any case shaded off
into bourgeois radicalism and whose principles—reform without
revolution—did not condemn such cooperation had really no reason to do
likewise. Jaurès accordingly felt no compunction at the time of the Dreyfus
crisis (1898) in lending support to a bourgeois government in order to defend
the Republic. Thus an old problem of socialist principle and tactics, which
was no problem at all in England or Sweden but a fundamental one
everywhere else, suddenly burst upon the socialist world in a most practical
form. 

It acquired its particular sting by an additional circumstance:

supporting a bourgeois government was one thing, though bad enough from
the standpoint of rigid orthodoxy, but sharing its responsibilities by actually
entering it was quite another thing. M.Millerand did precisely this. In 1899
he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet—together with M.de Galliffet, a
conservative general who was best known to the public for his vigorous
participation in the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871.
Two patriots sacrificing personal views in order to join forces in a national
emergency—what of it? This, I suppose, will express the reaction of most
of my readers. I need hardly assure them that personally I have no wish to
hold that the two gentlemen disgraced themselves. Moreover, it may well be
questioned whether even then M.Millerand should have been called a
socialist at all. 17 

The French working class has every reason to
remember with gratitude what, legislatively and administratively, he did for
it while in cabinet office.

At the same time, we must try to understand how “Millerandism” was
bound to strike the Guesdists in France and orthodox socialists all over
Europe. For them it spelled lapse and sin, betrayal of the goal, pollution of
the faith. This was very natural and so was the anathema hurled at it by the
international congress of Amsterdam (1904). But beyond and behind the
doctrinal anathema there was a piece of simple common sense. If the
proletariat was not to lend its back for ambitious politicians to use for
climbing into power, every deviation from approved practice had to be most
jealously watched.

<!-- 17 He had, it is true, risen to prominence among “left-wingers” by defending strike leaders
and when he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet he was the chief figure among the sixty
members of what was called the “socialist left.” However he had done nothing that could not
have been done equally well by a bourgeois radical. His later attitude as minister of public
works (1909) and as minister of war (1912) hence spelled not quite so great a break as his
enemies made out. His subsequent alliance with the bloc national and his conflict with the
cartel des gauches during his tenure of the presidential office after 1920 were different matters
yet they also admit of plausible justifications. -->

The trick of talking about national emergencies whenever it suits
careerists to make a bid for power—after all, was there ever a situation that
politicians did not consider an emergency?—was too well known and too
discredited to impress anyone, particularly the French proletariat that had
learned to rate political phrases at their true value. There was danger that the
masses might turn away from political socialism in contempt. 18
In fact, there was more than a mere danger. They were actually turning
away from it. Beholding, as the whole nation did, the sorry spectacle of
political inefficiency, incompetence and frivolity that was the product of the
sociological pattern imperfectly sketched above, they placed no trust in the
state, the political world, the scribblers, and had no respect for any of them
or indeed for anything or anybody except the memory of some great figures
of the past. Part of the industrial proletariat had conserved its Catholic faith.
The rest was adrift. And to those who had overcome their bourgeois
propensities, syndicalism was much more attractive than any of the available
species of straight socialism the sponsors of which bade fair to reproduce,
on a smaller scale, the games of the bourgeois parties. Revolutionary
tradition of the French type of which syndicalism was the principal heir, of
course greatly helped.

For syndicalism is not merely revolutionary trade unionism. This may
mean many things which have little to do with it. Syndicalism is apolitical
and anti-political in the sense that it despises action on or through the organs
of traditional politics in general and parliaments in particular. It is anti-
intellectual both in the sense that it despises constructive programs with
theories behind them and in the sense that it despises the intellectual’s
leadership. It really appeals to the workman’s instincts—and not, like
Marxism, to the intellectual’s idea of what the workman’s instincts ought to
be—by promising him what he can understand, viz., the conquest of the shop
he works in, conquest by physical violence, ultimately by the general strike.
Now, unlike Marxism or Fabianism, syndicalism cannot be espoused by
anyone afflicted by any trace of economic or sociological training. There is
no rationale for it. Writers who, acting on the hypothesis that everything
must be amenable to rationalization, try to construct a theory for it inevitably
emasculate it. Some linked it to anarchism which, as a social philosophy, is
completely alien to it in roots, aims and ideology—however similar the
behavior of Bakunin’s workingclass following (1872–1876) may look to us.
Others attempted to subsume it, as a special case characterized by a special
tactical bent, under Marxism, which involves discarding all that is most
essential to both. Still others have constructed a new socialist species to

function as the Platonic idea of it—guild socialism—but in doing so they had
to commit the movement to a definite schema of ultimate values the absence
of which is one of its salient features. The men who organized and led the
Confédération Générale du Travail during its syndicalist stage (1895–1914)
were mostly genuine proletarians or trade-union officers, or both. They were
brimming over with resentment and with the will to fight. They did not
bother about what they would do with the wreckage in case of success. Is
that not enough? Why should we refuse to recognize the truth which life
teaches us every day—that there is such a thing as pugnacity in the abstract
that neither needs nor heeds any argument and cares for nothing except for
victory as such?

But any intellectual can fill the void behind that brute violence in the
way that suits his taste. And the violence itself, combined with the anti-
intellectualism and the anti-democratic slant, acquires a significant
connotation if viewed in the setting of a disintegrating civilization that
so many people hate for all kinds of reasons. Those who at the time felt
like that but hated not so much the economic arrangements of capitalist
society as its democratic rationalism were not free to fall back on
orthodox socialism which promises still more rationalism. To their
intellectual anti-intellectualism—whether Nietzschean or Bergsonian—the
syndicalist anti-intellectualism of the fist may well have appealed as the
complement—in the world of the masses—of their own creed. Thus a
very strange alliance actually came to pass, and syndicalism found its
philosopher after all in Georges Sorel.

Of course all revolutionary movements and ideologies that coexist at any
time always have a lot in common. They are the products of the same social
process and must in many respects react in similar ways to similar
necessities. Also, they cannot avoid borrowing from each other or splashing
each other with their colors in their very squabbles. Finally, individuals as
well as groups often do not know where, if anywhere, they belong and,
sometimes from ignorance, at other times from a correct perception of
advantage, they mix up contradictory principles into mongrel creeds of their
own. All this confuses observers and accounts for the wide variety of current
interpretations. It is particularly confusing in the case of syndicalism which
flourished only so short a time and was soon to be deserted by its intellectual
exponents. Nevertheless, however we may appraise what syndicalism meant
to Sorel and what Sorel meant to syndicalism, his Reflexions sur la Violence
and his Illusions du Progrès do help us toward a diagnosis. That his
economics and his sociology completely differed from those of Marx may
in itself not mean much. But standing as it does right in the midst of the anti-
intellectualist torrent, Sorel’s social philosophy sheds a flood of light on the first practical manifestation of a social force that was and is revolutionary
in a sense in which Marxism was not.
