I. ENGLISH D EVELOPMENTS A ND T HE S PIRIT O F F ABIANISM

THERE is some symbolic significance in these two dates. The year 1875
saw the birth of the first purely socialist party that was powerful
enough to count as a factor in politics. This momentous event came to pass
through the merger of the two German groups—Lassalle’s group and
another founded by Bebel and Liebknecht in 1869—into the Social
Democratic Party which, though at the time (Gotha program) it made
considerable concessions to Lassalle’s creed, 1 eventually embraced
Marxism (Erfurt program, 1891) and steadily fought its way to the proud
position it held in 1914 when, like all socialist parties, it met the crisis of
its fate. 2 Before commenting on the astounding development that brought
a Marxist party, without any compromise involving sacrifice of principle,
within sight of parliamentary leadership, we shall glance at the course of
events in other countries and first at the English socialism of that period
which on the surface offers so striking and instructive a contrast to it.
Below the surface, there are of course substantially similar social
processes and, as parts of them, substantially similar labor movements.
The differences between the English and the German cases as to tone,
ideology and tactics are easily explained. Ever since the Owenite Grand
National Consolidated Trade Union had broken down in 1834 or since
chartism had ebbed away, the English labor movement had ceased to
elicit any determined hostility. Some of its economic aims were espoused
by the liberal and others by the conservative party. 3 The trade union acts
of 1871, 1875 and 1876, for instance, were passed without anything that
could have stung labor into militancy. Moreover, the battle for

<!-- 1 Lassalle’s main nostrum was organization of the workmen into state-aided producers’
cooperatives that were to compete with, and in the end to eliminate, private industry. This so
obviously smacks of utopianism that it is not difficult to understand Marx’s aversion.
2 It then held no out of 397 seats in the Reichstag and, owing to the inability of the bourgeois
groups to organize great homogeneous parties, this meant even more than the figure in itself
suggests.
3 The emergence of a pro-labor attitude in the conservative camp is particularly striking.
On the one hand the group led by Lord Ashley, and on the other hand the Young England group
(Disraeli’s Tory Democracy) may be mentioned by way of illustration. -->

enfranchisement was fought out by non-socialist groups, the masses not
having to do much except cheering and booing. In all this, the superior
quality of the rank and file of English labor stands out well. So does the
superior quality of English political society; after having proved itself
able to avoid an analogon to the French Revolution and to eliminate the
dangers threatening from dear bread, it then continued to know how to
manage social situations of increasing difficulty and how to surrender
with some grace—witness the Trades Disputes Act of 1906. 4 In
consequence, the English proletariat took longer in becoming “class-
conscious” or in getting to the landmark at which Keir Hardie was able
to organize the Independent Labour Party (1893). But the rise of the New
Unionism 5 eventually heralded a state of things that, barring
verbalization, did not differ essentially from the German one.
The nature and extent of such difference as there was will stand out most
clearly if for a moment we look at the group whose aims and methods
express it to perfection, the Fabian Society. Marxists will smile
contemptuously at what to them must seem to be a gross exaggeration of the
importance of a small group of intellectuals which never wished to be
anything else. In reality, the Fabians in England, or the attitudes they
embodied, were just as important as were the Marxists in Germany.
The Fabians emerged in 1883, and remained for the whole of our period

<!-- 4 It is difficult now to realize how this measure must have struck people
who still believed in a state and in a legal system that centered in the institution of private
property. For in relaxing the law of conspiracy in respect to peaceful picketing—which
practically amounted to legalization of trade-union action implying the threat of force—
and in exempting trade-union funds from liability in actions for damages for torts—which
practically amounted to enacting that trade unions could do no wrong—this measure in fact
resigned to the trade unions part of the authority of the state and granted to them a position
of privilege which the formal extension of the exemption to employers’ unions was
powerless to affect. Yet the bill was the result of the report of a Royal Commission set up
in 1903 when the conservative party was in power. And the conservative leader (Balfour),
in a speech on the third reading, accepted it without displaying any discomfort. The
political situation in 1906 no doubt goes far to explain this attitude. But this does not
invalidate my point. -->

<!-- 5 The New Unionism means the spread of regular and stable organizations which to the
middle of the nineties were substantially confined to the skilled trades and had developed
attitudes of professional pride and bourgeois respectability (some leaders of the eighties,
like Crawford, frequently emphasized the gulf that separated the respectable people in the
trade unions from the proletarian mass) to the more or less unskilled strata below them.
These felt much less sure of their bargaining power and were hence more amenable to
socialist propaganda and to the argument that strikes alone were unsafe weapons and that
they should be supplemented by political action. There is thus an important link between
that downward spread of unionism and the change in the trade unions’ attitude toward
political activity on the one hand and toward socialism on the other. It was then—a few
years after the great dock strike of 1889—that trade-union congresses began to pass
socialist resolutions. -->

a small group of bourgeois intellectuals. 6 They hailed from Bentham and Mill
and carried on their tradition. They entertained the same generous hopes for
humanity as the philosophical radicals had before them. They went forth to
work for rational reconstruction and improvement in the same spirit of
practical progressivism.

They were careful about their facts which some of them took no end of
trouble to collect by means of extensive research, and critical of arguments
and measures. But they were quite uncritical as to the fundamentals, cultural
and economic, of their aims. These they took for granted which is only
another way of saying that, like good Englishmen, they took themselves for
granted. They were unable to see the difference between a slum and the
House of Lords. Why both of these were obviously “bad things,” that’s
common sense, is it not? And greater economic equality or self-government
in India or trade unions or free trade were no less obviously “good things,”
who could doubt it? All the thinking that was necessary was on how to clean
up the bad things and on how to secure the good things; everything else was
irritating futility. Single-minded devotion to public service was as much in
evidence in all this as was intolerance of other views about individual and
national values—in its way quite as pronounced as was that of the
Marxists—and an element of petty-bourgeois resentment against everything
aristocratic, including beauty.
At first there was nothing behind the Fabians. They set out to persuade
whoever would, listen. They lectured to working-class and to bourgeois crowds.
They pamphleteered ably and extensively. They recommended or fought
particular policies, plans and bills. The most important of all their avenues to
influence however was their contact with individual “keymen,” or rather with
individuals in the entourage of political, industrial and labor leaders. Their
country and their own social and political location in their country offered a
unique opportunity for establishing and exploiting such contacts.
English political society does not always accept outsiders’ advice but,
much more than any other society, it is ready to listen to it. 

Some of
the Fabians were not simply outsiders. A few were able to avail themselves
of connections formed in Oxford and Cambridge students’ unions and
common rooms. They were not living, morally speaking, on another planet.
Most of them were not straight enemies of the established order. All of them
stressed willingness to cooperate much more than hostility. They were not
out to found a party and greatly disliked the phraseology of class war and revolution. 

Whenever possible they preferred making themselves useful to
making themselves a nuisance. And they had something to offer to the
parliamentarian or administrator who often welcomed suggestions as to what
should be done and how to do it.

<!-- 6 The group, which never numbered more than from 3000 to 4000 members, was really still
smaller than its membership indicates. For the operative nucleus amounted to no more than 10
or 20 per cent of it. This nucleus was bourgeois in background and tradition and also in another
respect: most of its members were economically independent at least in the sense that they had
a bare competence to live on. -->



A modern cabinet minister can in general find within the walls of his
ministry most of the information and suggestions he needs. In particular, he
can never suffer from lack of statistics. That was not so in the eighties and
nineties. With rare exceptions, civil servants of all ranks knew their routine
and little else. Outside of the lines of established policies the parliamentarian
in office, still more the parliamentarian out of office, was often hard up for
facts and ideas especially in the field of the “new” social problems. A group
that had them in stock and was always willing to serve them up, neatly
arranged and ready for use from the treasury or any other bench, was sure
to have entrée, especially by the backdoor. The civil service accepted this.
And not only that: being to a considerable extent in sympathy with at least
the immediate aims of the Fabians, it allowed itself to be educated by them.
The Fabians in turn also accepted this role of unofficial public servants. In
fact, it suited them perfectly. They were not personally ambitious. They liked
to serve behind the scene. Action through the bureaucracy whose growth in
numbers and in power they foresaw and approved fitted in very well with
the general scheme of their democratic state socialism.
But how—so Marx would have asked and so the little group of English
Marxists (Hyndman’s Democratic Federation, born in 1881) actually did
ask—could that kind of achievement ever amount to anything if, indeed,
it did not amount to conspiracy with the political exponents of the
bourgeois interests? How could it be called socialist at all and, if so, was
this not another edition of Utopian socialism (in the Marxist sense defined
above)? It is easy to visualize how perfectly nauseating Fabians and
Marxists must have been to each other and how heartily they must have
despised each other’s illusions, though it was the practice of the Fabians
to avoid the discussions of fundamental principles and tactics in which
Marxists delighted and to bear with the latter in an attitude of slightly
patronizing sympathy. Yet for the detached observer there is no difficulty
in answering these questions.
Socialist endeavor of the Fabian type would not have amounted to anything
at any other time. But it did amount to much during the three decades
preceding 1914, because things and souls were ready for that kind of message
and neither for a less nor for a more radical one. Formulation and organization
of existing opinion were all that was needed in order to turn possibilities into
articulate policy, and this “organizing formulation” the Fabians provided in a
most work-manlike manner. They were reformers. The spirit of the times made
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties324
socialists of them. They were genuine socialists because they aimed at helping
in a fundamental reconstruction of society which in the end was to make
economic care a public affair. They were voluntarist socialists and therefore
they would at any earlier stage have come within the Marxian concept of
utopists. But as it was, they had their bearings waiting for them so that the
implications of that concept did not fit their case. From their standpoint it
would have been nothing short of madness to rouse the bourgeois quarry into
awareness of danger by talking about revolutions and class wars. The
awakening of class consciousness was precisely what they wanted to avoid,
at least at first, since it would have rendered impossible the peaceful but
effective spread of their principles throughout the political and administrative
organs of bourgeois society. When things had sufficiently matured, they did
not hesitate to help the Independent Labour party into existence, to cooperate
with (and on) the Labour Representation Committee of 1900, to start the trade
unions on their political career, to shape the course of the Progressive party
in the London County Council, to preach first municipal and then general
socialism—and, eventually, the virtues of the soviet system.
No doubt there is a side to all this which it would be easy to make
the subject of adverse comment. But, after all, if they never issued a
resounding declaration of war more Marxiano and never told the quarry
exactly what they were going to do to it, they also never undertook to
protect it. Another criticism that might be leveled against the Fabians
from the opposite standpoint, viz., that their modus procedendi courted
the danger of getting stuck in the outlying defenses of the capitalist
system and that it might never lead to the grand pitched battle, fails to
take account of their peculiar attitude. On their behalf it can be replied
that if, par l’impossible, their attack on the capitalist system succeeded
in reforming it sufficiently without killing it, why, that would only be
a matter for congratulation. And as to the pitched battle, they answered
their revolutionary critics in advance by adopting, with singular felicity,
the name of the Roman general who, for all his circumspection, did
more than any of his impetuous predecessors had done toward driving
Hannibal from Italy.
Thus, though it might be said with truth that, in the matter of class war
as in others, Fabianism is the very opposite of Marxism, it might also be held
that the Fabians were in a sense better Marxists than Marx was himself. To
concentrate on the problems that are within practical politics, to move in step
with the evolution of things social, and to let the ultimate goal take care of
itself is really more in accord with Marx’s fundamental doctrine than the
revolutionary ideology he himself grafted upon it. To have no illusions about
an imminent catastrophe of capitalism, to realize that socialization is a slow

process which tends to transform the attitudes of all classes of society, even
spells superiority in fundamental doctrine.

Every country has its own socialism. But things did not differ greatly from
the English paradigma in those continental countries whose contributions to
humanity’s fund of cultural values is so strikingly out of proportion to their
size—the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries in particular. Take
Sweden for an instance. Like her art, her science, her politics, her social
institutions and much besides, her socialism and her socialists owe their
distinction not to any peculiar features of principle or intention, but to the
stuff the Swedish nation is made of and to its exceptionally well-balanced
social structure. That is why it is so absurd for other nations to try to copy
Swedish examples; the only effective way of doing so would be to import
the Swedes and to put them in charge.
The Swedes being the people they are and their social structure being
what it is, we shall have no difficulty in understanding the two outstanding
characteristics of their socialism. The socialist party, almost always ably
and conscientiously led, grew slowly in response to a very normal social
process, without any attempt to push ahead of normal development and to
antagonize for the sake of antagonizing. Hence its rise to political power
produced no convulsions. Responsible office came naturally to its leaders
who were able to meet the leaders of other parties on terms of equality and
largely on common ground: to this day, though a communist group has of
course developed, the differences in current politics reduce to such
questions as whether a few million kroner more or less should be spent on
some social purpose accepted by all. And within the party, the antagonism
between intellectuals and labor men only shows under the microscope
precisely because, owing to the level of both, there is no great cultural gulf
between them and because, the Swedish social organism producing a
relatively smaller supply of unemployable intellectuals than do other social
organisms, exasperated and exasperating intellectuals are not as numerous
as they are elsewhere. This is sometimes described as the “enervating
control” exerted by trade unions over the socialist movement in general and
over the party in particular. To observers steeped in the phraseology of
current radicalism, this may well seem so. But this diagnosis entirely fails
to do justice to the social and racial environment of which not only the
labor men but also the intellectuals are the products and which prevents
both of them from exalting their socialism into a religion. Though room
might be found in Marx’s teaching for such patterns, the average Marxist
cannot of course be expected to look with favor upon a socialist party of
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties326
the Swedish type, or even to admit that it embodies a genuine case of
socialist endeavor. Swedish socialists in turn were very lightly tinged with
Marxism though they frequently used language that conformed to what was
then considered socialist etiquette, especially in their international relations
with other socialist groups.
On the other end of the scale, in Russia, we find a socialism that was
almost purely Marxist and hence enjoyed that favor to the full, but is no less
easy to understand from its environment. Tsarist Russia was an agrarian
country of largely pre-capitalist complexion. The industrial proletariat, so far
as it was accessible to the professional socialist, formed but a small part of
the total population of about 150 millions. 7 The commercial and industrial
bourgeoisie, correspondingly weak in numbers, was not much more efficient
than was anyone else, though capitalist evolution fostered by the government
was rapidly gathering momentum. Inserted into this structure was an
intelligentsia whose ideas were as foreign to the soil as were the Paris dresses
of Russian society women.
To many of the intellectuals, the form of government then prevailing—
an absolute monarch (autocrator) heading a huge bureaucracy and allied with
the landed aristocracy and the church—was of course abomination. And
public opinion all over the world has accepted their reading of history. Even
writers most hostile to the regime that followed upon that of the tsars
invariably make haste to assure their readers that they are duly horrified at
the monstrosity of tsarism. Thus the simple truth has been entirely lost in a
maze of cant phrases. As a matter of fact, that form of government was no
less appropriate to the social pattern that had produced it than was the
parliamentary monarchy in England and the democratic republic in the
United States. The performance of the bureaucracy, considering the
conditions under which it had to work, was far above what the world has
been made to believe; its social reforms, agrarian and other, and its halting
steps toward a diluted type of constitutionalism were all that could have been
expected in the circumstances. It was the imported radicalism and the group
interest of the intellectuals that clashed with the spirit of the nation and not
the tsarist monarchy which on the contrary had a strong hold upon the vast
majority of all classes.
From this, two conclusions follow which at first sight seem paradoxical
though no serious student of history will consider them so. On the one hand,
any big or sudden move in the direction desired by those liberal lawyers, doctors,
professors and civil servants that formed the Kadet party (the party of the
Constitutional Democrats) was impossible not so much because their program
7 In 1905 factory employment amounted to about one million and a half.
From 1875 to 1914 327
was inacceptable to the monarchy as because they were so weak. Admitting them
to power would have meant admitting an element that commanded not more but
less support among the masses and was not more but less in sympathy with their
feelings and interests than were the groups that ran tsarism. There was no scope
for a bourgeois regime let alone a socialist one. And there was no analogy
between the French situation of 1789 and the Russian situation of 1905. The
social structure that crumbled in 1789 was obsolete, stood in the way of almost
everything that had any vitality in the nation, and was unable to cope with the
fiscal, economic and social problems of the hour. This was not so in the Russia
of 1905. There had been loss of prestige owing to the defeat suffered at the hands
of Japan and there were disaffection and disorder in consequence. But the state
proved itself equal to the tasks not only of suppressing the disorder but also of
attacking the problems behind it. In France the result was Robespierre, in Russia
it was Stolypin. This would not have been possible if the life had gone out of
tsarism as it had gone out of the French ancien régime. There is no reason for
assuming that, but for the strain the World War put upon the social fabric, the
Russian monarchy would have failed to transform itself peacefully and
successfully under the influence of, and in step with, the economic development
of the country.8
8 This analysis, of course, raises questions of great interest concerning the nature of what
we are in the habit of calling historical necessity on the one hand and of the role in the historical
process of the quality of individual leadership on the other. It would, I think, be difficult to
hold that Russia was driven into the war by inexorable necessity. The interests at stake in the
Serbian quarrel were not of vital importance, to say the least. The domestic situation in 1914
was not such as to enforce a policy of military aggression as a last resort. The former no doubt
actuated nationalists, the latter some (not all) of the extreme reactionaries, and both a number
of individuals and groups with axes to grind. But a modicum of common prudence and firmness
in the last of the tsars could no doubt have averted participation in the war. It would have been
more difficult, but it cannot be called impossible, to avert catastrophe later on when the situation
had declared itself and when, after the battle of Gorlice, all hope for military success had gone.
Even after the downfall of the monarchy, it is by no means certain that the Kerensky government
could not have saved the situation by carefully husbanding its resources and refusing to yield
to the importunity of the Allies instead of ordering that desperate last attack. But tsarist society
before the bourgeois revolt, and bourgeois society after it, watched the approaching doom in a
state of paralysis that was as unmistakable as it is difficult to explain. Now the presence of
groupwise incompetence in the one camp and of ability and energy in the other cannot of course
be attributed to chance. But in this case, the incompetence of the old regime merely amounted
to its being not equal to a situation of complete disorganization and this situation could
doubtless have been avoided.
The reader will hardly expect to find that my analysis of Russian socialism and its
environmental conditions agrees with Trotsky’s (History of the Russian Revolution, English
translation by M.Eastman, 1934). All the more significant is the fact that the two do not differ
toto coelo and that, in particular, Trotsky considered the question what would have happened
if the revolutionary movement had impinged upon a “different tsar.” It is true that he dismisses
the obvious inference from considerations of that order. But he recognizes that the Marxist
doctrine does not constrain us to neglect the element of personality, though he does not seem
to admit the full importance of it for a diagnosis of the Russian revolution.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties328
On the other hand, it was precisely because of the fundamental stability
of the social structure that the intellectuals, who could not hope to prevail
by anything like normal methods, were driven into a desperate radicalism
and into courses of criminal violence. Theirs was the kind of radicalism
whose intensity is in inverse proportion to its practical possibilities, the
radicalism of impotence. Assassinations might be futile and productive of
nothing but repression but there was not much else to do. The brutality of
the methods of repression in turn produced retaliation and thus that tragedy
unfolded, the tragedy of cruelty and crime incessantly reinforcing each
other, which is all that the world saw and felt and which it diagnosed as
we should expect.
Now Marx was no putschist. For some of the antics of Russian
revolutionaries, especially for those of the Bakunin type, he harbored as
much hatred as is compatible with contempt. Moreover, he should have
seen—perhaps he did see—that the social and economic structure of
Russia failed to fulfill every one of the conditions which according to his
own doctrine are essential for the success and even for the emergence of
his type of socialism. But if, on logical grounds, this should have
prevented the Russian intellectuals from embracing his teaching, we shall
understand readily why, on the contrary, it was a tremendous success with
them. They were—more or less seriously—revolutionaries and they were
at loose ends. Here was a revolutionary gospel of unsurpassable force.
Marx’s glowing phrases and chiliastic prophecy were exactly what they
needed in order to get out of the dreary desert of nihilism. Moreover, this
compound of economic theory, philosophy and history suited the Russian
taste to perfection. Never mind that the gospel was quite inapplicable to
their case and really held out no promise to them. The believer always
hears what he wants to hear, no matter what the prophet actually says.
The further removed the actual situation was from the state of maturity
which Marx visualized, the more ready were the Russian intellectuals—
not only the professed socialists among them—to look to him for a
solution of their problems.
Thus, a Marxist group emerged as early as 1883, to evolve into the
Social Democratic party in 1898. Leadership and, at the beginning,
membership were primarily intellectual of course, though sufficient
success attended the underground organizing activity among the “masses”
to enable sympathetic observers to speak of a fusion of labor groups
under Marxist leadership. This accounts for the absence of many of the
difficulties met by other Marxist groups in countries with strong labor
unions. In any case at first, the workmen who entered the organization
accepted the intellectuals’ leadership with the utmost docility and hardly
From 1875 to 1914 329
even pretended to decide anything for themselves. In consequence,
developments in doctrine and in action were on strictly Marxian lines and
on a high level. Naturally this drew the blessings of the German
defenders of the faith who, beholding such disarming virtue, evidently
felt that there must be some exceptions to the Marxian thesis that serious
socialism can spring only from full-fledged capitalism. Plekhanov,
however, the founder of the group of 1883 and the leading figure of the
first two decades, whose able and learned contributions to Marxist
doctrine commanded universal respect, really accepted this thesis and
therefore cannot have hoped for the early realization of socialism. While
valiantly fighting the good fight against reformism and all the other
contemporaneous heresies that threatened the purity of the faith, and
while upholding belief in the revolutionary goal and method, this true
Marxist must have felt early misgivings at the rise, within the party, of a
group that seemed bent on action in the immediate future, though he
sympathized with it and with its leader, Lenin.
The inevitable conflict that split the party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks
(1903) meant something much more serious than a mere disagreement
regarding tactics such as the names of the two groups suggest. At the time
no observer, however experienced, could have realized fully the nature of the
rift. By now the diagnosis should be obvious. The Marxist phraseology
which both groups retained obscured the fact that one of them had
irrevocably broken away from classical Marxism.
Lenin had evidently no illusions concerning the Russian situation. He saw
that the tsarist regime could be successfully attacked only when temporarily
weakened by military defeat and that in the ensuing disorganization a resolute
and well-disciplined group could by ruthless terror overthrow whatever other
regime might attempt to replace it. For this contingency, the likelihood of
which he seems to have realized more clearly than did anyone else, he was
resolved to prepare the appropriate instrument. He had little use for the semi-
bourgeois ideology about the peasants—who of course in Russia constituted
the relevant social problem—and still less for theories about the necessity of
waiting for the workmen to rise of their own initiative in order to accomplish
the grand revolution. What he needed was a well-trained bodyguard of
revolutionist janissaries, deaf to any argument but his own, free from all
inhibitions, impervious to the voices of reason or humanity. Under the
circumstances and in the requisite quality such a troop could be recruited only
from the intellectual stratum, and the best material available was to be found
within the party. His attempt to gain control of the latter therefore amounted
to an attempt to destroy its very soul. The majority and their leader, L.Martov,
must have felt that. He did not criticize Marx or advocate any new departure.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties330
He resisted Lenin in the name of Marx and stood for the Marxist doctrine of
a proletarian mass party. The novel note was struck by Lenin.
Since time immemorial, heretics have invariably claimed that they
were not out to destroy whatever gospel they found in possession but,
on the contrary, that they were trying to restore its pristine purity.
Lenin, adopting the time-honored practice, exalted and out-Marxed
Marx instead of renouncing allegiance. At the most, he gave the lead
implied in the phrase that became so popular with Trotsky and Stalin,
“Marxism in the epoch of imperialism.” And the reader will readily see
that, up to a certain crucial range, it was not difficult for Lenin to adopt
both form and matter of unadulterated Marxism. Yet it is no less easy
to see that from this stronghold he sallied forth to occupy an essentially
un-Marxian position. Un-Marxian was not merely the idea of
socialization by pronunciamiento in an obviously immature situation;
much more so was the idea that “emancipation” was to be not, as the
Marxist dogma has it, the work of the proletariat itself but of a band
of intellectuals officering the rabble. 9 This meant more than a different
view about agitatorial practice and compromises, more than a
disagreement on secondary points of Marxist doctrine. This meant
divorce from its innermost meaning. 10
9 As a matter of fact, contact with criminal elements was formed, though not by Lenin
himself but by (he lieutenants on the spot. This led to the activity of the “ex’s” (shock groups
engaged in practical “expropriations,” i.e., holdups) both in Russia proper and in Poland. This
was pure gangsterdom though western intellectuals swallowed an apologetic “theory” of it.
10 For our purpose it is not necessary to comment further on the details of a well-known
story. The following remarks will suffice. Lenin did not succeed in subjugating the Russian
socialist party whose leaders on the contrary drew away from him as time went on the difficulty
of their situation, arising from their wish to keep up something like a united front without
jettisoning their principles, is well illustrated by Plekhanov’s vacillations. But Lenin did succeed
in keeping his group together, in curbing it into obedience and in adjusting its course to the
problems raised by the revolt of 1905 and its aftermath, including the presence of a Leninist
element in the Duma. At the same time, he succeeded in keeping contact with, and standing
in, the Second International (see below) of which he attended three congresses and in whose
bureau he for a time represented the Russian party. This would hardly have been possible if
his views and activities had been allowed to impress the representatives of the other nations as
they impressed the majority of Russian socialists. As it was, that body, and western socialist
opinion in general, looked upon him simply as the outstanding figure in the left wing of
orthodoxy and bore with him and his unbending extremism, admiring him in some respects and
not taking him too seriously in others. Thus in his sphere of politics he played a double role
that was not without analogy with the double role of the tsarist regime whose international
attitudes (as exemplified by its sponsoring international arbitration and security) also differed
considerably from its attitudes at home.
Neither these achievements nor his contributions to socialist thought—most of them
distinctly mediocre (as, by the way, were those of Trotsky)—would have secured him a place
in the front rank of socialists. Greatness came after Russia s breakdown in the World War and
was as much the result of a unique combination of circumstances that made his weapons

III. S OCIALIST G ROUPS I N T HE U NITED S TATES
In the United States a totally different social pattern proved as
unfavorable as was the Russian to the growth of a genuinely socialist
mass movement. Thus the two cases present similarities that are no less
interesting than the differences. If the agrarian world of Russia, in spite
of the streak of communism inherent in the structure of the Russian
village, was practically impervious to the influence of modern
socialism, the agrarian world of the United States provided an anti-
socialist force that stood ready to make short work of any activities on
Marxist lines important enough to be noticed by it. If the industrial
sector of Russia failed to produce a significant socialist mass party
because capitalist evolution was so sluggish, the industrial sector of the
United States failed to do so because capitalist evolution rushed on at
such a vertiginous pace. 11
The most important difference was between the respective intellectual
groups: unlike Russia, the United States did not, until the end of the
nineteenth century, produce an under-employed and frustrated set of
intellectuals. The scheme of values that arose from the national task of
developing the economic possibilities of the country drew nearly all the
brains into business and impressed the businessman’s attitudes upon the soul
of the nation. Outside of New York, intellectuals in our sense were not
numerous enough to count. Most of them moreover accepted this scheme of
values. If they did not. Main Street refused to listen and instinctively frowned
upon them, and this was much more effective in disciplining them than were
the methods of the Russian political police. Middle-class hostility to
railroads, utilities and big business in general absorbed almost all there was
of “revolutionary” energy.
The average competent and respectable workman was, and felt himself
to be, a businessman. He successfully applied himself to exploiting his own
individual opportunities, to getting on or, in any case, to selling his labor
as advantageously as possible. He understood and largely shared his
employer’s way of thinking. When he found it useful to ally himself with
his peers within the same concern, he did so in the same spirit. Since
roughly the middle of the nineteenth century this practice increasingly took
adequate as the result of his supreme ability in handling them. In this respect, though in no
other, Professor Laski’s proskynesis in the Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences (article
Ulyanov) is fully understandable, provided of course that intellectuals must prostrate themselves
before the idols of their time.
11 The presence of the “frontier” of course greatly reduced the possibilities of friction. The
importance of this element, though great, is however likely to be over-estimated. That pace of
industrial evolution incessantly created new industrial frontiers, and this fact was much more
important than was the opportunity of packing one’s bags and going west.

the form of employees’ committees, the forerunners of the postwar
company unions that acquired their full economic and cultural significance
in company towns. 12
Beyond that, it was frequently good business for the workman to combine
on a national scale with the other members of his craft in order further to
improve his bargaining position as against employers directly and as against
other crafts indirectly. This interest shaped many trade unions that are
typically American, largely accounts for the adoption of the craft principle
which is much more effective than any other principle can be in keeping
away would-be entrants, and really produced workmen’s cartels. Naturally
enough, these cartels displayed that lack of radicalism which was and is so
eloquently lamented by both domestic and foreign socialists and fellow
travelers. Nothing but wage rates and hours mattered to them and they were
quite prepared to study the wishes of the public or even of the employers in
everything else, particularly in their phraseology. This is illustrated to
perfection by the type and behavior of the leaders both of individual unions
and of the American Federation of Labor which embodied that spirit, as well
as by the attempts of the trade-union bureaucracy to enter, with trade-union
funds, the sphere of industrial and financial enterprise that was quite
congenial to them. 13
To be sure, the fact that the creeds and slogans—the ideologies—were so
unrevolutionary and so averse to class war is in itself of limited importance.
American trade unionists were not much given to theorizing. If they had been
they might have put a Marxist interpretation upon their practice. It remains
12 The common sense of the arrangement and its particular suitability to American conditions
are as obvious as is the fact that it was a thorn in the flesh of trade unions and also of the radical
intellectuals of a later type. The slogans of our days—recently officialized—have thus
stigmatized company unions as the product of a diabolical attempt by employers to thwart the
efforts toward effective representation of the workmen’s interests. While this view too is
perfectly understandable from a standpoint from which militant organization of the proletariat
is in the nature of a moral axiom—and from the standpoint of the corporative state that grows
up before our eyes—it vitiates historical interpretation. The fact that employers provided
facilities for this type of organization, often took the initiative and tried to influence it so as to
be able to get along with it, does not exclude or disprove the other fact that company unions
and their forerunners fulfilled a much-needed function and that, in the normal case, they served
the interests of the men quite well.
13 The figure of Warren Sanford Stone, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, affords
an excellent (though later) illustration of the last-mentioned aspect as well as of the others.
Further examples from the time of Samuel Gompers will so readily occur to the reader that
there is no need of mentioning them. But the above should not be interpreted to mean that the
trade union with high entrance fees and long waiting lists which looks so strangely like a copper
corner is or was the only kind of trade union in this country. On the contrary, immigrants
imported every European variety, and, irrespective of this, forms similar to those found in
Europe developed where conditions were favorable, that is, especially in the relatively old and
consolidated locations and branches of industry.
From 1875 to 1914 333
true however that, bargaining aside, they did not consider themselves on the
other side of the fence in all things and that cooperation—which those of
us who do not like it will call collusion—with employers was in accord not
only with their principles but also with the logic of their situation. Beyond
a narrow range of questions, political action was not only unnecessary but
even meaningless to them. And for the influence he was able to exert, the
radical intellectual might just as well have tried to convert the board of the
Pennsylvania Railroad.
But there was another world within the world of American labor. Along
with elements of supernormal quality, immigration included from the first
some substandard ones also which increased in relative as well as absolute
numbers after the Civil War. These numbers were swelled by individuals who,
though not subnormal as to physical fitness or intelligence or energy, yet
gravitated into that group, owing to past misfortunes or to the persistence of
the influence of the unfavorable environments from which they sprang or
simply owing to restlessness, inadaptable temperament or criminal proclivities.
All these types were an easy prey to exploitation which was facilitated by the
absence of moral bonds, and some of them reacted by a blind and impulsive
hatred that readily crystallized into crime. In many new and rapidly growing
industrial communities where people of the most varied origins and
propensities were thrown together and law and order had to be kept, if at all,
by action that was itself outside of the law, rough people, made still rougher
by the treatment they received, faced employers, or agents of employers, who
had not yet developed a sense of responsibility and were often driven to brutal
courses by a fear not only for their property but also for their lives.
There, so the socialist observer is inclined to say, was class war in the
most literal sense—actual guns going off to illustrate the Marxist concept.
As a matter of fact, it was nothing of the sort. It is hard to imagine any
set of conditions less favorable to the development of political laborism or
of serious socialism, and very little of either showed as long as those
conditions lasted.
The history of the Knights of Labor, the one really important and nation-
wide organization of all wageworkers regardless of skill or craft—and in fact
of all who cared to join—covers about a decade of significant power and
activity (1878–1889). In 1886 the Noble Order’s membership was almost
700,000. The part of it which consisted of industrial—mainly unskilled—
laborers energetically participated in or even initiated the strikes or boycotts
that accompanied the depressions of that time. A scrutiny of programs and
pronouncements reveals a somewhat incoherent medley of all sorts of
socialist, cooperative and, occasionally, anarchist ideas that we can trace, if
we wish, to a wide variety of sources—Owen, the English agrarian socialists,
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties334
Marx, and the Fabians among them. The political point of view was much
in evidence and so was the idea of general planning and of social
reconstruction. But such definiteness of aims as we may discover is really
due to our reading back from the standpoint of our own time. In reality there
were no definite aims and it was precisely the comprehensive character of
the ideology of the Good Life—Uriah S.Stephens, the founder, had been
trained for the ministry—and of the American Constitution which appealed
to so many people, farmers and professional men included. The Order thus
was a sort of exchange for the plans of all kinds of reformers. In this respect
it indeed filled a function which its leaders had in mind when they stressed
the educational aspect of its activities. But an organization formed of such
different clays was constitutionally incapable of action. When definitely
socialist profession was insisted on, it broke. Similar movements (Populists,
Henry George’s and others) tell the same tale.
The obvious inference is that in the American environment of that time
there was not and could not be either the requisite material or the requisite
motive power for a socialist mass movement. This can be verified by following
the thread that leads from the Knights to the Industrial Workers of the World.
This thread is embodied in the career of a Marxist intellectual, Daniel De Leon,
and hence should have, for the faithful, considerable specific weight.14 It was
under his command that, in 1893, socialists within the Order of the Knights
rose against the old leader, Powderly, thereby, as it turned out, dealing a death
blow to the organization. The idea was to create an instrument for political
action on more or less Marxian lines. Class war, revolution, destruction of the
capitalist state and the rest of it were to be sponsored by a proletarian party.
But neither the Socialist Labor Party (1890) nor De Leon’s Socialist Trade and
Labor Alliance (1895) had any life in it. Not only was the working-class
following small—this would not in itself have been decisive—but success even
of the Russian kind, that is to say, conquest of a controlling nucleus of
intellectuals, was not attained. The Socialist Labor party first split and then lost
most of the remaining ground to the new Socialist party.
The latter came as near to being an orthodox success as any group did in
this country. To begin with, its origin was orthodox. It arose from the labor
struggles during 1892–1894, when strikes were broken by the use of force,
the federal government and the judiciary lending resolute support to the
14 All the more so as Lenin himself went out of his way to pay homage, quite unusual for
him, to De Leon’s work and thought.
15 It will be observed that this was done at a time when most European governments were
rapidly adopting another attitude. However, this does not simply spell “backwardness” on this
side of the Atlantic. It is true that the social and political prestige of the business interest was
here much greater than anywhere else and that American democracy in consequence took a
much narrower view of labor problems than did, say, the Junker government in Prussia. But
From 1875 to 1914 335
employers. 15 This converted many a man who had been previously a
“conservative” craft unionist. At any rate, it converted Eugene V. Debs first
to industrial unionism and then to the principle of political action. Secondly,
the general attitude adopted by the Socialist party was orthodox. It tried to
work with and to “bore from within” the trade unions. It gave itself a regular
political organization. It was in principle revolutionary in the same sense as
were the great socialist parties of Europe. Its doctrine was not quite orthodox.
In fact it did not stress doctrinal aspects to any great extent—either under
Debs or later—and it allowed considerable latitude to the teaching activities
within its ranks. But though it never succeeded in absorbing the little local
labor parties that kept on cropping up all over the country, it developed fairly
well up to the postwar period when communist competition asserted itself.
A majority of socialists would, I think, agree in calling it the one genuine
socialist party of this country. Its voting strength, though swelled as that of
most socialist parties is by non-socialist sympathizers, measures the scope
there was for serious socialist effort.
De Leon however had another chance. It came from—and went with—
the Western Federation of Miners whose radicalism, quite independent of any
doctrinal background, was nothing but the product of rough people reacting
to a rough environment. This union provided the corner stone for the
structure of the I.W.W. (1905). De Leon and his, associates added the
wreckage of their own and other unsuccessful organizations as well as
splinters mostly of dubious character—intellectual or proletarian or both—
from everywhere and nowhere. But the leadership—and in consequence the
phraseology—was strong. Besides De Leon himself, there were Haywood,
Trautmann, Foster and others.
Shock tactics that knew no inhibitions and the spirit of uncompromising
warfare account for a series of isolated successes, and the absence of
anything else but phrases and shock tactics, for the ultimate failure that was
hastened by quarrels with and defections to the communists as well as by
incessant internal dissensions. But I need not retell a story that has been told
so often from every conceivable standpoint. What matters to us is this. The
organization has been called syndicalist—even anarchist—and later on the
criminal syndicalism laws enacted in several states were applied to it. The
principle of “direct” action on the spot and the doctrinal concession to the
Western Federation of Miners which assigned to industrial unions a basic
one can recognize this and even judge it according to one’s moral or humanitarian standard,
and at the same time also recognize that partly owing to the undeveloped state of public
administration, partly owing to the presence of elements with which no gentler method would
have worked, and partly owing to the nation’s determination to press forward on the road of
economic development, problems did present themselves under a different aspect and would
have done so even to a governmental agency completely free from bourgeois blinkers.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties336
role in the construction of socialist society—De Leon’s contribution to or
deviation from classical Marxism—no doubt suggest that it was. But it seems
more correct to speak of the insertion of syndicalist elements into what
substantially was and remained an offshoot, of the Marxian stem than to base
diagnosis entirely on those elements.
Thus that great sociologist, the man in the street, has been right once
more. He said that socialism and socialists were un-American. If I catch
his meaning, it amounts pretty much to what, less succinctly, I have
been trying to convey. American development practically skipped the
phase of socialism which saw the career of unadulterated Marxism and
of the Second International. Their essential problems were hardly
understood. The attitudes appropriate to them existed only as sporadic
imports. American problems and attitudes occasionally borrowed these
imported articles. But that was all. And the events of the next phase
impinged on intellectuals and on a proletariat that had not gone through
the Marxian school.


IV. T HE F RENCH C ASE ; A NALYSIS O F S YNDICALISM
What syndicalism really is we shall see best in the French picture. 16 Before
attempting to do so we shall briefly note a few things about French
socialism in general.

First, its ideological history goes further back and is perhaps more
distinguished than that of any other. But no single variety of it ever
crystallized so completely and commanded allegiance so widely as did the
socialism of, say, the Fabian type on the one hand and of the Marxian on
the other. Fabian socialism requires English political society, and nothing
like that developed in France—the great revolution and the subsequent
failure of the aristocratic and the bourgeois elements to coalesce prevented
it. Marxian socialism requires a broad and unified labor movement; or, as
a rallying creed for intellectuals, it requires cultural traditions quite
uncongenial to French limpidité. But all the other socialist creeds that have
so far emerged appeal only to particular mentalities and social locations
and are sectarian by nature.

Second, France was typically the country of the peasant, the artisan, the
clerk and the small rentier. Capitalist evolution proceeded by measured steps
and large-scale industry was confined to a few centers. Whatever the issues
that divided these classes, they were economically conservative at first—
nowhere else did conservatism rest on so broad a basis—and later on lent
16 Italian and Spanish syndicalism would do almost equally well. Only, in proportion to the
number of illiterates, the anarchist element increases so much as to distort what I believe to
be the true traits. This element has its place. But it should not be overemphasized.

From 1875 to 1914 337
increasing support to groups that sponsored middle-class reform, among
them the radicaux-socialistes, a party that can be best described by saying
that it was neither radical nor socialist. Many workmen were of the same
sociological type and of the same mind. Many professionals and intellectuals
adapted themselves to it, which accounts for the fact that over-production
and under-employment of intellectuals, though it existed, failed to assert
itself as we should otherwise expect. Unrest there was. But among the
malcontents, the Catholics, who disapproved of the anti-clerical tendencies
that various circumstances brought to the fore in the Third Republic, were
more important than the people who were displeased with the capitalist order
of things. It was from the former and not from the latter that the real danger
to the bourgeois republic arose at the time of the affaire Dreyfus.
Third, it follows that, though again for different reasons, there was not
much more scope for serious socialism in France than there was in Russia
or the United States. Hence she had a variety of socialisms and quasi-
socialisms that were not serious. The Blanquist party whose hope was the
action of “a few resolute men” may serve as an example: a small band of
intellectuals with a bent for conspiracy and professional revolutionists
together with the mob of Paris and two or three other big towns was all
that ever came within the horizon of groups like that. Eventually however
a Marxist parti ouvrier was founded by Guesde and Lafargue with a class-
war program (1883) that had received the sanction of Marx himself. It
developed on orthodox lines, fighting putschism of the Hervé type and
anarchism on the one front and Jaurès’ reformism on the other, much as
its German counterpart did. But it never acquired similar importance and
never meant nearly as much either to the masses or to the intellectuals, in
spite of the merger of socialist groups in the chambre which was achieved
in 1893 (48 seats as compared with the 300 occupied by governmental
republicans) and eventually led to the formation of the Unified Socialist
party (1905).
Fourth, I will simply state the fact, without attempting to go behind it,
that the social pattern glanced at above precluded the emergence of great and
disciplined parties of the English type. Instead, as every one knows,
parliamentary politics became a cotillon of small and unstable groups that
combined and dissolved in response to momentary situations and individual
interests and intrigues, setting up and pulling down cabinets according to the
principles, as I put it before, of a parlor game. One of the consequences of
this was governmental inefficiency. Another was that cabinet office came
within the sight of socialist and quasi-socialist groups sooner than it did in
countries whose socialist parties were much more powerful but whose
politics were run according to somewhat more rational methods. Until the
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties338
national emergency of 1914, Guesde and his group proved impervious to the
temptation and consistently refused cooperation with bourgeois parties in the
best orthodox style. But the reformist group which in any case shaded off
into bourgeois radicalism and whose principles—reform without
revolution—did not condemn such cooperation had really no reason to do
likewise. Jaurès accordingly felt no compunction at the time of the Dreyfus
crisis (1898) in lending support to a bourgeois government in order to defend
the Republic. Thus an old problem of socialist principle and tactics, which
was no problem at all in England or Sweden but a fundamental one
everywhere else, suddenly burst upon the socialist world in a most practical
form. It acquired its particular sting by an additional circumstance:
supporting a bourgeois government was one thing, though bad enough from
the standpoint of rigid orthodoxy, but sharing its responsibilities by actually
entering it was quite another thing. M.Millerand did precisely this. In 1899
he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet—together with M.de Galliffet, a
conservative general who was best known to the public for his vigorous
participation in the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871.
Two patriots sacrificing personal views in order to join forces in a national
emergency—what of it? This, I suppose, will express the reaction of most
of my readers. I need hardly assure them that personally I have no wish to
hold that the two gentlemen disgraced themselves. Moreover, it may well be
questioned whether even then M.Millerand should have been called a
socialist at all. 17 Finally, the French working class has every reason to
remember with gratitude what, legislatively and administratively, he did for
it while in cabinet office.
At the same time, we must try to understand how “Millerandism” was
bound to strike the Guesdists in France and orthodox socialists all over
Europe. For them it spelled lapse and sin, betrayal of the goal, pollution of
the faith. This was very natural and so was the anathema hurled at it by the
international congress of Amsterdam (1904). But beyond and behind the
doctrinal anathema there was a piece of simple common sense. If the
proletariat was not to lend its back for ambitious politicians to use for
climbing into power, every deviation from approved practice had to be most
jealously watched.
17 He had, it is true, risen to prominence among “left-wingers” by defending strike leaders
and when he entered the Waldeck-Rousseau cabinet he was the chief figure among the sixty
members of what was called the “socialist left.” However he had done nothing that could not
have been done equally well by a bourgeois radical. His later attitude as minister of public
works (1909) and as minister of war (1912) hence spelled not quite so great a break as his
enemies made out. His subsequent alliance with the bloc national and his conflict with the
cartel des gauches during his tenure of the presidential office after 1920 were different matters
yet they also admit of plausible justifications.
From 1875 to 1914 339
The trick of talking about national emergencies whenever it suits
careerists to make a bid for power—after all, was there ever a situation that
politicians did not consider an emergency?—was too well known and too
discredited to impress anyone, particularly the French proletariat that had
learned to rate political phrases at their true value. There was danger that the
masses might turn away from political socialism in contempt. 18
In fact, there was more than a mere danger. They were actually turning
away from it. Beholding, as the whole nation did, the sorry spectacle of
political inefficiency, incompetence and frivolity that was the product of the
sociological pattern imperfectly sketched above, they placed no trust in the
state, the political world, the scribblers, and had no respect for any of them
or indeed for anything or anybody except the memory of some great figures
of the past. Part of the industrial proletariat had conserved its Catholic faith.
The rest was adrift. And to those who had overcome their bourgeois
propensities, syndicalism was much more attractive than any of the available
species of straight socialism the sponsors of which bade fair to reproduce,
on a smaller scale, the games of the bourgeois parties. Revolutionary
tradition of the French type of which syndicalism was the principal heir, of
course greatly helped.
For syndicalism is not merely revolutionary trade unionism. This may
mean many things which have little to do with it. Syndicalism is apolitical
and anti-political in the sense that it despises action on or through the organs
of traditional politics in general and parliaments in particular. It is anti-
intellectual both in the sense that it despises constructive programs with
theories behind them and in the sense that it despises the intellectual’s
leadership. It really appeals to the workman’s instincts—and not, like
Marxism, to the intellectual’s idea of what the workman’s instincts ought to
be—by promising him what he can understand, viz., the conquest of the shop
he works in, conquest by physical violence, ultimately by the general strike.
Now, unlike Marxism or Fabianism, syndicalism cannot be espoused by
anyone afflicted by any trace of economic or sociological training. There is
no rationale for it. Writers who, acting on the hypothesis that everything
must be amenable to rationalization, try to construct a theory for it inevitably
emasculate it. Some linked it to anarchism which, as a social philosophy, is
completely alien to it in roots, aims and ideology—however similar the
behavior of Bakunin’s workingclass following (1872–1876) may look to us.
Others attempted to subsume it, as a special case characterized by a special
tactical bent, under Marxism, which involves discarding all that is most
essential to both. Still others have constructed a new socialist species to
18 The Italian socialists actually declined the invitation to join the cabinet that was three
times extended to them by Giolitti (1903, 1906, 1911).
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties340
function as the Platonic idea of it—guild socialism—but in doing so they had
to commit the movement to a definite schema of ultimate values the absence
of which is one of its salient features. The men who organized and led the
Confédération Générale du Travail during its syndicalist stage (1895–1914)
were mostly genuine proletarians or trade-union officers, or both. They were
brimming over with resentment and with the will to fight. They did not
bother about what they would do with the wreckage in case of success. Is
that not enough? Why should we refuse to recognize the truth which life
teaches us every day—that there is such a thing as pugnacity in the abstract
that neither needs nor heeds any argument and cares for nothing except for
victory as such?
But any intellectual can fill the void behind that brute violence in the
way that suits his taste. And the violence itself, combined with the anti-
intellectualism and the anti-democratic slant, acquires a significant
connotation if viewed in the setting of a disintegrating civilization that
so many people hate for all kinds of reasons. Those who at the time felt
like that but hated not so much the economic arrangements of capitalist
society as its democratic rationalism were not free to fall back on
orthodox socialism which promises still more rationalism. To their
intellectual anti-intellectualism—whether Nietzschean or Bergsonian—the
syndicalist anti-intellectualism of the fist may well have appealed as the
complement—in the world of the masses—of their own creed. Thus a
very strange alliance actually came to pass, and syndicalism found its
philosopher after all in Georges Sorel.
Of course all revolutionary movements and ideologies that coexist at any
time always have a lot in common. They are the products of the same social
process and must in many respects react in similar ways to similar
necessities. Also, they cannot avoid borrowing from each other or splashing
each other with their colors in their very squabbles. Finally, individuals as
well as groups often do not know where, if anywhere, they belong and,
sometimes from ignorance, at other times from a correct perception of
advantage, they mix up contradictory principles into mongrel creeds of their
own. All this confuses observers and accounts for the wide variety of current
interpretations. It is particularly confusing in the case of syndicalism which
flourished only so short a time and was soon to be deserted by its intellectual
exponents. Nevertheless, however we may appraise what syndicalism meant
to Sorel and what Sorel meant to syndicalism, his Reflexions sur la Violence
and his Illusions du Progrès do help us toward a diagnosis. That his
economics and his sociology completely differed from those of Marx may
in itself not mean much. But standing as it does right in the midst of the anti-
intellectualist torrent, Sorel’s social philosophy sheds a flood of light on the
From 1875 to 1914 341
first practical manifestation of a social force that was and is revolutionary
in a sense in which Marxism was not.
V. T HE G ERMAN P ARTY A ND R EVISIONISM ; T HE A USTRIAN S OCIALISTS
But why was it that the English methods and tactics did not prevail in
Germany? Why that Marxist success which accentuated antagonisms and
split the nation into two hostile camps? This would be easy to understand if
there had been no extra-socialist groups to work for social reconstruction or
if the ruling stratum had turned a deaf ear to their proposals. It becomes a
riddle as soon as we realize that German public authority was not less but
more alive to the social exigencies of the time than was English political
society and that the work of the Fabians was being done not less but more
effectively by a very similar group.
Germany did not lag behind but, until the passing of the security
legislation primarily associated with the name of Lloyd George, led in
matters of “social policy.” Also, it was the government’s initiative that placed
those measures for social betterment on the statute book, and not pressure
from below asserting itself by exasperating struggles. Bismarck initiated
social insurance legislation. The men who developed it and added other lines
of social improvement were conservative civil servants (von Berlepsch,
Count Posadowsky) carrying out the directions of William II. The institutions
created were truly admirable achievements and they were so considered all
over the world. Simultaneously, trade-union activity was unfettered and a
significant change occurred in the attitude of public authority toward strikes.
The monarchist garb in which all this appeared no doubt constitutes a
difference as against the English procedure. But this difference made for
more and not less success. The monarchy, after having for a time given in
to economic liberalism (“Manchesterism” as its critics called it), simply
returned to its old traditions by doing—mutatis mutandis—for the workmen
what it had previously done for the peasants. The civil service, much more
developed and much more powerful than in England, provided excellent
administrative machinery as well as the ideas and the drafting skill for
legislation. And this civil service was at least as amenable to proposals of
social reform as was the English one. Largely consisting of impecunious
Junkers—many of whom had no other means of subsistence than their truly
Spartan salaries—entirely devoted to its duty, well educated and informed,
highly critical of the capitalist bourgeoisie, it took to the task as a fish takes
to water.
Ideas and proposals normally came to the bureaucracy from its teachers
at the universities, the “socialists of the chair.” Whatever we may think of
the scientific achievements of the professors who organized themselves into
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties342
the Verein für Sozialpolitik19 and whose work often lacked scientific
refinement, they were aglow with a genuine ardor for social reform and
entirely successful in spreading it. They resolutely faced bourgeois
displeasure not only in framing individual measures of practical reform but
also in propagating the spirit of reform. Like the Fabians, they were primarily
interested in the work at hand and they deprecated class war and revolution.
But, also like the Fabians, they knew where they were going—they knew and
did not mind that socialism loomed at the end of their way. Of course, the
state socialism they envisaged was national and conservative. But it was
neither a fake nor utopian.
The world at large never understood this social pattern and the nature of
the constitutional monarchy it produced. At any rate, it has forgotten
whatever it may have once known. But as soon as we get a glimpse of the
truth, we find it still more difficult to understand how in that unplutocratic
environment it was possible for the greatest of all socialist parties to grow
up on a purely Marxist program and on a Marxist phraseology of
unsurpassed virulence, pretending to fight ruthless exploitation and a state
that was the slave of slave drivers. Surely this cannot be explained by the
“logic of the objective social situation.”
Well, I suppose we must recognize once more that in the short run—and
forty years is short run in such matters—methods and mistakes, individual
and group-wise manque de savoir faire, may count for much more than that
logic. Everything else I could point to is obviously inadequate. There was,
of course, the struggle for the extension of the franchise in the legislatures
of the individual states. But much of what was most important to the
industrial masses was within the competence of the imperial parliament
(Reichstag) and for it Bismarck had introduced universal manhood suffrage
from the first. More important was protection for agriculture—dear bread.
No doubt this did much to poison the atmosphere, especially because its
principal beneficiaries were the big and medium-sized estates in eastern
Prussia and not the peasants. However, as to the real pressure exerted by it,
the fact is conclusive that around 1900 emigration practically ceased. No—
explanation cannot lie on that route.
But that manque de savoir faire plus German manners! We may make
things clearer by the obvious analogy with Germany’s behavior in matters
of international relations. Before 1914, Germany’s colonial and other foreign
19 I really wish I could induce the reader to peruse the short history of that unique
organization that was so characteristic of what imperial Germany really was, though it has not
been and probably never will be translated. Its author was for decades secretary of the Verein,
and his story is only the more impressive for being so unpretentious. (Franz Boese, Geschichte
des Vereins für Sozialpolitik, Berlin, 1939.)
From 1875 to 1914 343
ambitions were—so it seems right to say at this distance of time—distinctly
modest, especially if we compare them with the neat and effective moves by
which England and France at that time increased their empires. Nothing that
Germany actually did or indicated any intention of doing will bear
comparison with, say, Tel-El-Kebir or with the Boer War or with the
conquest of Tunisia or of French Indo-China. All the less modest and all the
more aggressive, however, was the talking that Germans indulged in, and
unbearably offensive was the swashbuckling manner in which even
reasonable claims were presented. Worse than this, no line was ever adhered
to; headlong forward rushes in ever-changing directions alternated with
blustering retreats, undignified propitiations with uncalled-for rebuffs, until
all the factors that make the world’s opinion were thoroughly disgusted as
well as disquieted. 20 Things were no different in domestic affairs.
The fatal mistake was really Bismarck’s. It consisted in the attempt,
explicable only on the hypothesis that he completely misconceived the nature
of the problem, at suppressing socialist activities by coercion culminating in
a special enactment (Sozialistengesetz) which he carried in 1878 and which
remained in force until 1890 (when William II insisted on its repeal), that is
to say, long enough to educate the party and to subject it for the rest of the
prewar period to the leadership of men who had known prison and exile and
had acquired much of the prisoner’s and exile’s mentality. Through an
unfortunate combination of circumstances, it so happened that this vitiated
the whole course of subsequent events. For the one thing those exile-shaped
men could not stand was militarism and the ideology of military glory. And
the one thing which the monarchy—otherwise in sympathy with a large part
of what reasonable socialists considered as immediately practical aims—
could not stand was sneers at the army and at the glories of 1870. More than
anything else, this was for both what defined the enemy as distinguished
from the mere opponent. Add Marxian phraseology—however obviously
academic—at the party conventions on the one hand and the aforesaid
blustering on the other, and you have the picture. No amount of fruitful
social legislation and no amount of law-abiding behavior availed against that
reciprocal non possumus, that cardboard barrier across which the two hosts
20 I want to make it quite clear that the above is not intended to attribute this policy, either
wholly or primarily, to William II. He was no insignificant ruler. Moreover, he was fully entitled
to the comment made upon him by Prince Bülow in the most unusual defense ever made for a
monarch in a parliament: “Say what you will, he is no philistine.” If he quarreled with the one
man who could have taught him the technique of his craft, critics of his behavior to Bismarck
should not forget that the quarrel was mainly about the persecution of socialists which the
emperor wished to discontinue and about the inauguration of a great program of social
legislation. If one disregards talk and simply tries to reconstruct intentions by following the
emperor’s acts from year to year, one cannot help arriving at the conclusion that he was often
right in his views about the great questions of his time.

reviled each other, made the most terrible faces at each other, devoured each
other in principle—all without really meaning any serious harm.
From this state of things a situation developed that no doubt had its
dangers—great power without responsibility is always dangerous—but was
not anything like as uncomfortable as it might seem. The federal and state
governments—or the old civil servants promoted to cabinet rank who formed
those governments—cared primarily for honest and efficient administration,
for beneficial and on the whole progressive legislation, and for the army and
navy estimates. None of these objects was seriously jeopardized by the
adverse votes of the socialists, the passing of the army and navy estimates
in particular being assured most of the time by the support of a large
majority of the population. The Social Democratic party in turn, well
organized and brilliantly led by August Bebel, was absorbed in consolidating
and expanding its vote which in fact increased by leaps and bounds. This
was not seriously interfered with by the governments, the bureaucracy
scrupulously observing the letter of the law which gave all the freedom of
action really necessary for partisan activity. 21 And both the managing
bureaucracy and the party had reason to be grateful to each other, especially
during Bülow’s tenure of power, for providing outlets for oratorical excess
capacity of which both of them stood in need.
Thus the party not only developed satisfactorily but also settled down.
A party bureaucracy, a party press, a staff of elder statesmen developed,
all adequately financed, as a rule secure in their positions and, on the
whole, highly respectable in every—and also in the bourgeois—sense of
the word. A nucleus of working-class members grew up for whom
membership was no longer a question of choice but a matter of course.
More and more people were “born into the party” and educated to
unquestioning acceptance of its leadership and catechism which then, for
some of them, meant as much and no more than religious catechisms mean
to the average man or woman of today.
All this was greatly facilitated by the inability of the non-socialist parties
to compete effectively for the labor vote. There was an exception to this. The
Centrist (Catholic) party, on the one hand, commanded all the talent required
because it had the support of a priesthood of quite exceptionally high quality
and, on the other hand, was prepared to make a bid for the labor vote by
going as far in the direction of social reform as it felt itself able to do without
21 Administrative vexations were doubtless not absent, and socialists of course made the
most of everything that could by any stretch be styled as vexatious. But this sort of thing did
not go to great lengths as in fact the history of socialist activity from 1890 to the First World
War in itself suffices to prove. Moreover, vexations of this kind are really in the nature of a
service to the “persecuted”
From 1875 to 1914 345
affronting its right wing, and by taking its stand on the doctrines of the
encyclicals Immortale Dei (1885) and Rerum Novarum (1891). 22 But all the
other parties, though for different reasons and in different degrees, stood on
a footing of mutual distrust, if not of hostility, with the industrial proletariat
and never so much as attempted to sell themselves to any significant number
of labor voters. These, unless they were active Catholics, accordingly had
hardly any party to turn to other than the Social Democratic party.
Unbelievable as such ineptitude seems in the light of English and American
experience, it is yet a fact that the socialist army was allowed, amid all the
clamor about the horrible dangers threatening from it, to march into
politically unguarded territory.
We are now in a position to understand what, on the face of it, seems
so incomprehensible, viz., why German socialists so tenaciously clung to
the Marxian creed. For a powerful party that could afford a distinctive
creed yet was completely excluded not only from political responsibility
but from any immediate prospect of it, it was natural to conserve the
purity of the Marxian faith once it had been embraced. That purely
negative attitude toward non-socialist reform and all the doings of the
bourgeois state—which as we have seen above was the tactical principle
Marx recommended for all save exceptional cases—was really thrust
upon it. The leaders were not irresponsible nor were they desperadoes.
But they realized that in the given situation there was not much for the
party to do except to criticize and to keep the banner flying. Any sacrifice
of revolutionary principle would have been perfectly gratuitous. It would
have only disorganized their following without giving to the proletariat
much more than it got in any case, not on the initiative of the other
parties but on that of the monarchist bureaucracy. Such small additional
successes as might have been attained hardly warranted the party risk.
Thus, serious, patriotic and law-abiding men continued to repeat the
irresponsible slogans of revolution and treason—the sanguinary
implications of which came so strangely from many a pacific and
bespectacled countenance—blissfully conscious of the fact that there was
little likelihood of their having to act upon them.
Before long however the suspicion began to dawn upon a few of them
that some day or other the revolutionary talk might meet the most deadly
22 Let us note in passing an interesting (almost American) phenomenon: here we have a
political party that comprised within itself almost all shades of opinion on economic and
social questions that it is possible to have, from the starkest conservatism to radical socialism,
and yet was a most powerful political engine. Men of the most different types, origins and
desires, extreme democrats and extreme authoritarians, cooperated with a smoothness that
might have roused the envy of the Marxists, solely on the strength of their allegiance to the
Catholic Church.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties346
weapon of political controversy—smiles. Perhaps it was an apprehension of
this kind or simply the perception of the almost ludicrous discrepancy
between Marxian phraseology and the social reality of those times that
eventually prompted no less a personage than old Engels to pronounce ex
cathedra—that is to say, in a preface he wrote to a new edition of Marx’s
Class Struggles in France23 —that street fighting presented certain
inconveniences after all and that the faithful need not necessarily feel
committed to it (1895).
This timely and modest adjustment roused the wrath of a small minority
of thoroughgoing hotspurs, Mrs. Rosa Luxemburg in particular surpassing
herself in fiery denunciations of the old man. But it was acquiesced in by
the party—possibly with a sigh of relief—and further cautious steps in the
same direction might perhaps have been tactfully made. When however
Eduard Bernstein coolly proceeded to “revise” the whole structure of the
party creed, there was a major row. After what I have said about the situation
this should not be surprising.
Even the most worldly party is aware of the dangers involved in altering
any of its more important planks. In the case of a party whose program and
whose very existence were based on a creed every detail of which had been
worked out with theological fervor, root-and-branch reform was bound to
mean a terrific shock. That creed was the object of quasi-religious reverence.
It had been upheld for a quarter of a century. Under its flag the party had
marched to success. It was all the party had to show. And now the beloved
revolution—that was to them what the Second Coming of the Lord was to
the early Christians—was to be unceremoniously called off. No class war any
more. No thrilling war cries. Cooperation with bourgeois parties instead. All
this from a member of the old guard, a former exile, and, as it happened,
one of the most lovable members of the party!
But Bernstein 24 went further still. He laid sacrilegious hands on the
hallowed foundations of the doctrine. He attacked the Hegelian background.
The labor theory of value and the exploitation theory came in for stricture.
He doubted the inevitability of socialism and reduced it to tame
“desirability.” He looked askance at the economic interpretation of history.
Crises would not kill the capitalist, dragon; on the contrary, with time
capitalism would gain in stability. Growing misery was nonsense of course.
Bourgeois liberalism had produced lasting values which it was worth while
23 It has been shown by Ryazanov that the editor of this book took liberties with Engels’
text. But the above argument is not affected by even the highest possible estimate of the ravages
of his pencil. See Ryazanov, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels (translated by Kunitz, 1927).
24 The two books of his that are most relevant for our purpose are Die Voraussetzungen des
Sozialismus und die Aufgaben der Sozialdemokratie (1899), translation by E.C.Harvey, 1909,
and Zur Ceschichte und Theorie des Sozialismus (1901).
From 1875 to 1914 347
trying to conserve. He even said that the proletariat was not everything.
Think of that!
This of course was more than the party could stand. It would have been
unbearable even if Bernstein had been incontestably right on every point,
for creeds embodied in an organization cannot be reformed by means of
holocausts. But he was not. He was an excellent man but he was not
Marx’s intellectual peer. We have seen in Part I that he went too far in the
matter of the economic interpretation of history which he can hardly have
fully understood. He also went too far in his assertion that developments
in the agrarian sector refute Marx’s theory of the concentration of
economic control. And there were other points inviting effective reply so
that the champion of orthodoxy, Karl Kautsky, 25 found it not too difficult
to hold his ground—or some of it. Nor is it so clear that it would have been
to the advantage of the party had Bernstein’s tactical recommendations
prevailed. A wing would certainly have broken away. The prestige of the
party would have suffered greatly. And, as has been stated before, no
immediate gain would have accrued. There was hence a lot to be said for
the “conservative” view.
Under the circumstances, the course which Bebel took was neither so
obviously unwise nor so obviously tyrannical as fellow travelers and other
critics made out at the time. He denounced Revisionism vigorously, so
vigorously as to keep his hold on his leftists. He had it anathematized at the
conventions in Hanover (1899) and Dresden (1903). But he saw to it that
the resolutions reaffirming class war and other articles of faith were so
framed as to make it possible for “revisionists” to submit. They did, and no
further measures were taken against them though there was, I believe, some
cracking of the whip. Bernstein himself was allowed to enter the Reichstag
with the support of the party. Von Vollmar remained in the fold.
Trade-union leaders shrugged their shoulders and murmured about the
chewing of doctrinal cud. They had been revisionists all along. But so long
as the party did not interfere in their immediate concerns and so long as it
did not call upon them to do anything they really disliked, they did not much
care. They extended protection to some revisionists and also to some of their
literary organs. They made it quite clear that, whatever the party’s
philosophy, business was business. But that was all.
The intellectual revisionists for whom doctrine was not a matter of
25 From that time on, Kautsky, the founder and editor of the Neue Zeit and author of several
treatises on Marxist theory, held a position that can be described only in ecclesiastical terms,
upholding the “revolutionary” doctrine against revisionism as he was later on to uphold
orthodoxy against the bolshevik heretics. He was the most professorial of men and much less
lovable than Bernstein. On the whole, however, both sections of the party must be congratulated
on the moral as as on the intellectual level of their champions.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties348
indifference, and the non-socialist sympathizers some of whom would have
liked to join a socialist party that did not stress class war and revolution,
thought differently of course. It was they who talked about a party crisis and
shook their heads about the future of the party. They had every reason to do
so. For their future in and around the party was indeed jeopardized. In fact
Bebel, himself no intellectual and no friend to parlor pinks, lost no time in
warning them off the premises. The rank and file of the party however were
but little disturbed about all this. They followed their leaders and repeated
their slogans until, without any compunction about what Marx or, for that
matter, Bebel would have said, they rushed to arms in order to defend their
country.
Some interesting light is shed on the development we have just been
surveying by the parallel yet different development in Austria.26 As we should
expect from the much slower pace of capitalist development, it took twenty
years longer to become a political factor of importance. Rising slowly from
small and not very creditable beginnings, it eventually established itself in
1888 (convention of Hainfeld) under Victor Adler, who had succeeded in the
almost desperate task of welding together the socialists of all the nations who
inhabited that country and who was to lead them, with consummate ability,
for another thirty years.
Now this party was also officially Marxist. The little circle of brilliant
Jews that formed its intellectual nucleus, 27 the Neo-Marxists, even
contributed substantially to the development of Marxian doctrine as we have
seen in Part I—going on along orthodox lines, altering them no doubt in the
process but fighting, bitterly and ably, anyone else who tried to do so, and
always keeping to the revolutionary ideology in its most uncompromising
form. The relations with the German party were close and cordial. At the
same time, everyone knew that Adler would stand no nonsense. Having, for
cultural and racial reasons, much more authority over his intellectual
extremists than Bebel ever had over his, he was able to allow them all the
Marxism they wanted in their cafés and to use them whenever he saw fit
without letting them interfere with what really mattered to him, the
organization and the party press, universal suffrage, progressive legislation
and, yes, the proper working of the state. This combination of Marxist
26 By Austria I here mean the western half of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy which since
1866 had a parliament and a government (lacking however the departments of foreign affairs
and of war) of its own that were coordinated on a footing of equality with the parliament and
government of the eastern half—Hungary or, to use official language, “the countries of the Holy
Crown of St. Stephen.” The Hungarian Social Democratic party took its pattern from the
Austrian, but never attained quantitative significance.

doctrine and reformist practice answered admirably. The Austrian
governments soon discovered that here was a factor, no less important than
the church or the army, that from its own interest was bound to support the
central authority in its perennial struggle with filibustering nationalist
oppositions, particularly the German and the Czech. These governments—
mostly civil servants’ cabinets as in Germany although attempts were made
incessantly by the crown to insert politicians, at least as ministers without
portfolio—thereupon proceeded to extend favors to the party, which
reciprocated in full. 28 And when a government (a civil servants’ cabinet
headed by Baron Gautsch) took up the cause of universal suffrage, Adler,
without encountering any opposition among his followers, was able to
declare publicly that, for the time being, the socialists were a “governmental
party” (Regierungspartei), although cabinet office was neither offered nor
would have been acceptable to them. 29
VI. T HE S ECOND I NTERNATIONAL
The internationalist plank in the program of the Marxist parties called for
an international organization like the defunct First International. The other
socialist and laborite groups were not internationalist in the sense of the
Marxian creed. But, partly from the inheritance of bourgeois radicalism and
partly from aversion to the upper-class governments of their respective
nations, they had all of them acquired, though in varying degrees,
internationalist and pacifist views and sympathies so that international
cooperation occurred readily to them. The foundation of the Second
International (1889) thus embodied a compromise that really attempted to
reconcile the irreconcilable but worked until 1914. A few remarks will suffice
on this subject.
There was the international bureau. And there were the congresses with
their full-dress debates on questions of tactics and of principle. Measured by
tangible achievements, the importance of the Second International might well
be equated to zero. And at zero it has indeed been evaluated both by
revolutionary activists and by laborites. As a matter of fact, however, it was
not meant for immediate action of any sort; action, whether revolutionary
28 A device which the socialists repeatedly used in order to help the government was this.
When nationalist filibusters paralyzed parliament and all business was at a standstill, they would
move “urgency” for the budget. The urgency motion when duly passed practically meant that
the measure thus declared urgent went through if there was a majority for it (which was always
available in the case of the budget) irrespective of those formal rules of parliamentary procedure
which the filibuster made it impossible to observe.
29 The chief difficulty was, I suppose, in the strong stand that the German party had taken
in the matter. Scruples of the Austrian socialists themselves were second in importance.
Aversion of the Austrian bureaucracy or of the old Emperor, if any, was a bad third among the
factors which prevented that consummation.

or reformist, could at that time have been only national. It was to organize
contacts between the affiliated parties and groups, to standardize views, to
coordinate lines of advance, to restrain the irresponsible, and to urge on the
laggard, to create, as far as possible, an international socialist opinion. All
of this was, from the socialist standpoint, extremely desirable and important
though in the nature of things positive results would have taken many
decades to mature.
Accordingly, the chief and the members of the bureau were anything
but a directing board of international socialism. There was no policy for
them to shape and no program to impose such as there had been in the
case of the First International. The national parties and labor groups were
left perfectly autonomous and free to join other international
organizations that might suit their particular aims. Trade unions—also
cooperatives and educational bodies—were welcomed and even courted
but they did not play the leading role. The national parties were
nevertheless kept on a common ground that was sufficiently broad for
Stauning and Branting on the one hand and Lenin and Guesde on the
other to move on. Some of the members of that international institute no
doubt sneered at the chicken-hearted reserve of others and the latter
objected to the hotheaded radicalism of the former. And sometimes things
came perilously near a showdown. On the whole however they all took
a course in socialist diplomacy at the hands of one another. Since this
modus vivendi—with plenty of freedom for agreeing to differ—was the
only possible one, this was in itself a great achievement.
Strange as it may sound, it was the Germans who were—with Russian and
Guesdist support—primarily responsible for it. They were the one great
Marxist party and they gave the common ground a coating of Marxism. But
they realized quite clearly that the majority of the men who represented the
socialist forces outside of Germany were not Marxists. For most of these men
it was a case of signing the thirty-nine articles while reserving an unlimited
freedom of interpretation. Naturally enough, the more ardent believers were
shocked at this and talked about the faith being degraded to a matter of form
that had no substance in it. The German leaders however put up with it. They
even tolerated straight heresy which they would have attacked furiously at
home. Bebel knew how far he could go and that his forbearance,
immediately met as it was by English forbearance, would pay in the end as,
without the war, it assuredly would have done. Thus he maneuvered to
cement the proletarian front with a view to vitalizing it in time, and in doing
so he showed an ability that, if Germany’s diplomacy had had it, might have
prevented the First World War.
Some results did mature. The somewhat indefinite discussions of the first
From 1875 to 1914 351
decade or so were eventually focused on foreign policy and something like
a common view began eventually to emerge. It was a race against time. This
race was lost. Every journalist who now refers to that epoch feels entitled
to condemn the International for what he styles the failure of international
socialism at the outbreak of the catastrophe. But this is a most superficial
view to take. The extraordinary congress at Basle (1912) and its appeal to
the workers of all nations to exert themselves for peace was surely all that
it was possible to do under those circumstances. A call for a general strike
issued to an international proletariat that exists nowhere except in the
imagination of a few intellectuals would not have been more effective, it
would have been less so. To achieve the possible is not failure but success,
however inadequate the success may prove in the end. If failure there was,
it occurred at the domestic fronts of the individual national parties.
