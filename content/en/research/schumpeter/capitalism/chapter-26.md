I. ENGLISH DEVELOPMENTS and the SPIRIT Of fABIANISM

THERE is some symbolic significance in these two dates. 

1875 saw the birth of the first purely socialist party that was powerful
enough to count as a factor in politics. 

This momentous event came to pass
through the merger of the two German groups—Lassalle’s group and
another founded by Bebel and Liebknecht in 1869—into the Social
Democratic Party which, though at the time (Gotha program) it made
considerable concessions to Lassalle’s creed, 1 eventually embraced
Marxism (Erfurt program, 1891) and steadily fought its way to the proud
position it held in 1914 when, like all socialist parties, it met the crisis of
its fate. 2 Before commenting on the astounding development that brought
a Marxist party, without any compromise involving sacrifice of principle,
within sight of parliamentary leadership, we shall glance at the course of
events in other countries and first at the English socialism of that period
which on the surface offers so striking and instructive a contrast to it.
Below the surface, there are of course substantially similar social
processes and, as parts of them, substantially similar labor movements.
The differences between the English and the German cases as to tone,
ideology and tactics are easily explained. Ever since the Owenite Grand
National Consolidated Trade Union had broken down in 1834 or since
chartism had ebbed away, the English labor movement had ceased to
elicit any determined hostility. Some of its economic aims were espoused
by the liberal and others by the conservative party. 3 The trade union acts
of 1871, 1875 and 1876, for instance, were passed without anything that
could have stung labor into militancy. Moreover, the battle for

<!-- 1 Lassalle’s main nostrum was organization of the workmen into state-aided producers’
cooperatives that were to compete with, and in the end to eliminate, private industry. This so
obviously smacks of utopianism that it is not difficult to understand Marx’s aversion.
2 It then held no out of 397 seats in the Reichstag and, owing to the inability of the bourgeois
groups to organize great homogeneous parties, this meant even more than the figure in itself
suggests.
3 The emergence of a pro-labor attitude in the conservative camp is particularly striking.
On the one hand the group led by Lord Ashley, and on the other hand the Young England group
(Disraeli’s Tory Democracy) may be mentioned by way of illustration. -->

enfranchisement was fought out by non-socialist groups, the masses not
having to do much except cheering and booing. In all this, the superior
quality of the rank and file of English labor stands out well. So does the
superior quality of English political society; after having proved itself
able to avoid an analogon to the French Revolution and to eliminate the
dangers threatening from dear bread, it then continued to know how to
manage social situations of increasing difficulty and how to surrender
with some grace—witness the Trades Disputes Act of 1906. 4 In
consequence, the English proletariat took longer in becoming “class-
conscious” or in getting to the landmark at which Keir Hardie was able
to organize the Independent Labour Party (1893). But the rise of the New
Unionism 5 eventually heralded a state of things that, barring
verbalization, did not differ essentially from the German one.
The nature and extent of such difference as there was will stand out most
clearly if for a moment we look at the group whose aims and methods
express it to perfection, the Fabian Society. Marxists will smile
contemptuously at what to them must seem to be a gross exaggeration of the
importance of a small group of intellectuals which never wished to be
anything else. In reality, the Fabians in England, or the attitudes they
embodied, were just as important as were the Marxists in Germany.
The Fabians emerged in 1883, and remained for the whole of our period

<!-- 4 It is difficult now to realize how this measure must have struck people
who still believed in a state and in a legal system that centered in the institution of private
property. For in relaxing the law of conspiracy in respect to peaceful picketing—which
practically amounted to legalization of trade-union action implying the threat of force—
and in exempting trade-union funds from liability in actions for damages for torts—which
practically amounted to enacting that trade unions could do no wrong—this measure in fact
resigned to the trade unions part of the authority of the state and granted to them a position
of privilege which the formal extension of the exemption to employers’ unions was
powerless to affect. Yet the bill was the result of the report of a Royal Commission set up
in 1903 when the conservative party was in power. And the conservative leader (Balfour),
in a speech on the third reading, accepted it without displaying any discomfort. The
political situation in 1906 no doubt goes far to explain this attitude. But this does not
invalidate my point. -->

<!-- 5 The New Unionism means the spread of regular and stable organizations which to the
middle of the nineties were substantially confined to the skilled trades and had developed
attitudes of professional pride and bourgeois respectability (some leaders of the eighties,
like Crawford, frequently emphasized the gulf that separated the respectable people in the
trade unions from the proletarian mass) to the more or less unskilled strata below them.
These felt much less sure of their bargaining power and were hence more amenable to
socialist propaganda and to the argument that strikes alone were unsafe weapons and that
they should be supplemented by political action. There is thus an important link between
that downward spread of unionism and the change in the trade unions’ attitude toward
political activity on the one hand and toward socialism on the other. It was then—a few
years after the great dock strike of 1889—that trade-union congresses began to pass
socialist resolutions. -->

a small group of bourgeois intellectuals. 6 They hailed from Bentham and Mill
and carried on their tradition. They entertained the same generous hopes for
humanity as the philosophical radicals had before them. They went forth to
work for rational reconstruction and improvement in the same spirit of
practical progressivism.

They were careful about their facts which some of them took no end of
trouble to collect by means of extensive research, and critical of arguments
and measures. But they were quite uncritical as to the fundamentals, cultural
and economic, of their aims. These they took for granted which is only
another way of saying that, like good Englishmen, they took themselves for
granted. They were unable to see the difference between a slum and the
House of Lords. Why both of these were obviously “bad things,” that’s
common sense, is it not? And greater economic equality or self-government
in India or trade unions or free trade were no less obviously “good things,”
who could doubt it? All the thinking that was necessary was on how to clean
up the bad things and on how to secure the good things; everything else was
irritating futility. Single-minded devotion to public service was as much in
evidence in all this as was intolerance of other views about individual and
national values—in its way quite as pronounced as was that of the
Marxists—and an element of petty-bourgeois resentment against everything
aristocratic, including beauty.
At first there was nothing behind the Fabians. They set out to persuade
whoever would, listen. They lectured to working-class and to bourgeois crowds.
They pamphleteered ably and extensively. 

They recommended or fought
particular policies, plans and bills. The most important of all their avenues to
influence however was their contact with individual “keymen,” or rather with
individuals in the entourage of political, industrial and labor leaders. Their
country and their own social and political location in their country offered a
unique opportunity for establishing and exploiting such contacts.
English political society does not always accept outsiders’ advice but,
much more than any other society, it is ready to listen to it. 

Some of
the Fabians were not simply outsiders. A few were able to avail themselves
of connections formed in Oxford and Cambridge students’ unions and
common rooms. They were not living, morally speaking, on another planet.
Most of them were not straight enemies of the established order. All of them
stressed willingness to cooperate much more than hostility. They were not
out to found a party and greatly disliked the phraseology of class war and revolution. 

Whenever possible they preferred making themselves useful to
making themselves a nuisance. And they had something to offer to the
parliamentarian or administrator who often welcomed suggestions as to what
should be done and how to do it.

<!-- 6 The group, which never numbered more than from 3000 to 4000 members, was really still
smaller than its membership indicates. For the operative nucleus amounted to no more than 10
or 20 per cent of it. This nucleus was bourgeois in background and tradition and also in another
respect: most of its members were economically independent at least in the sense that they had
a bare competence to live on. -->



A modern cabinet minister can in general find within the walls of his
ministry most of the information and suggestions he needs. In particular, he
can never suffer from lack of statistics. That was not so in the eighties and
nineties. With rare exceptions, civil servants of all ranks knew their routine
and little else. Outside of the lines of established policies the parliamentarian
in office, still more the parliamentarian out of office, was often hard up for
facts and ideas especially in the field of the “new” social problems. A group
that had them in stock and was always willing to serve them up, neatly
arranged and ready for use from the treasury or any other bench, was sure
to have entrée, especially by the backdoor. The civil service accepted this.
And not only that: being to a considerable extent in sympathy with at least
the immediate aims of the Fabians, it allowed itself to be educated by them.
The Fabians in turn also accepted this role of unofficial public servants. In
fact, it suited them perfectly. They were not personally ambitious. They liked
to serve behind the scene. Action through the bureaucracy whose growth in
numbers and in power they foresaw and approved fitted in very well with
the general scheme of their democratic state socialism.
But how—so Marx would have asked and so the little group of English
Marxists (Hyndman’s Democratic Federation, born in 1881) actually did
ask—could that kind of achievement ever amount to anything if, indeed,
it did not amount to conspiracy with the political exponents of the
bourgeois interests? How could it be called socialist at all and, if so, was
this not another edition of Utopian socialism (in the Marxist sense defined
above)? It is easy to visualize how perfectly nauseating Fabians and
Marxists must have been to each other and how heartily they must have
despised each other’s illusions, though it was the practice of the Fabians
to avoid the discussions of fundamental principles and tactics in which
Marxists delighted and to bear with the latter in an attitude of slightly
patronizing sympathy. Yet for the detached observer there is no difficulty
in answering these questions.

Socialist endeavor of the Fabian type would not have amounted to anything
at any other time. But it did amount to much during the three decades
preceding 1914, because things and souls were ready for that kind of message
and neither for a less nor for a more radical one. Formulation and organization
of existing opinion were all that was needed in order to turn possibilities into
articulate policy, and this “organizing formulation” the Fabians provided in a
most work-manlike manner. They were reformers. The spirit of the times made socialists of them. They were genuine socialists because they aimed at helping
in a fundamental reconstruction of society which in the end was to make
economic care a public affair. They were voluntarist socialists and therefore
they would at any earlier stage have come within the Marxian concept of
utopists. But as it was, they had their bearings waiting for them so that the
implications of that concept did not fit their case. From their standpoint it
would have been nothing short of madness to rouse the bourgeois quarry into
awareness of danger by talking about revolutions and class wars. The
awakening of class consciousness was precisely what they wanted to avoid,
at least at first, since it would have rendered impossible the peaceful but
effective spread of their principles throughout the political and administrative
organs of bourgeois society. When things had sufficiently matured, they did
not hesitate to help the Independent Labour party into existence, to cooperate
with (and on) the Labour Representation Committee of 1900, to start the trade
unions on their political career, to shape the course of the Progressive party
in the London County Council, to preach first municipal and then general
socialism—and, eventually, the virtues of the soviet system.
No doubt there is a side to all this which it would be easy to make
the subject of adverse comment. But, after all, if they never issued a
resounding declaration of war more Marxiano and never told the quarry
exactly what they were going to do to it, they also never undertook to
protect it. Another criticism that might be leveled against the Fabians
from the opposite standpoint, viz., that their modus procedendi courted
the danger of getting stuck in the outlying defenses of the capitalist
system and that it might never lead to the grand pitched battle, fails to
take account of their peculiar attitude. On their behalf it can be replied
that if, par l’impossible, their attack on the capitalist system succeeded
in reforming it sufficiently without killing it, why, that would only be
a matter for congratulation. And as to the pitched battle, they answered
their revolutionary critics in advance by adopting, with singular felicity,
the name of the Roman general who, for all his circumspection, did
more than any of his impetuous predecessors had done toward driving
Hannibal from Italy.

Thus, though it might be said with truth that, in the matter of class war
as in others, Fabianism is the very opposite of Marxism, it might also be held
that the Fabians were in a sense better Marxists than Marx was himself. To
concentrate on the problems that are within practical politics, to move in step
with the evolution of things social, and to let the ultimate goal take care of
itself is really more in accord with Marx’s fundamental doctrine than the
revolutionary ideology he himself grafted upon it. To have no illusions about
an imminent catastrophe of capitalism, to realize that socialization is a slow

process which tends to transform the attitudes of all classes of society, even
spells superiority in fundamental doctrine.
