These results each time consist in an avalanche of consumers’ goods
that permanently deepens and widens the stream of real income although in
the first instance they spell disturbance, losses and unemployment. And if
we look at those avalanches of consumers’ goods we again find that each
of them consists in articles of mass consumption and increases the
purchasing power of the wage dollar more than that of any other dollar—in
other words, that the capitalist process, not by coincidence but by virtue of
its mechanism, progressively raises the standard of life of the masses. It does
so through a sequence: of vicissitudes, the severity of which is proportional
to the speed of the advance. But it does so effectively. One problem after
another of the supply of commodities to the masses has been successfully
solved 10 by being brought within the reach of the methods of capitalist
production. The most important one of those that remain, housing, is
approaching solution by means of the pre-fabricated house.

And still this is not all. Appraisal of an economic order would be
incomplete—and incidentally un-Marxian—if it stopped at the output which
the corresponding economic conveyor hands to the various groups of society
and left out of account all those things that the conveyor does not serve
directly but for which it provides the means as well as the political volition,
and all those cultural achievements that are induced by the mentality it
generates. Deferring consideration of the latter (Chapter XI), we shall now
turn to some aspects of the former.

<!-- 9 These are the “long waves” which, in business cycle literature, are primarily associated
with the name of N.D.Kondratieff.
10 This of course also applies to agricultural commodities, the cheap mass production of
which was entirely the work of large-scale capitalist enterprise (railroads, shipping, agricultural
machinery, fertilizers). -->


The technique and atmosphere of the struggle for social legislation
obscures the otherwise obvious facts that, on the one hand, part of this
legislation presupposes previous capitalist success (in other words, wealth
which had previously to be created by capitalist enterprise) and that, on
the other hand, much of what social legislation develops and generalizes
had been previously initiated by the action of the capitalist stratum itself.

Both facts must of course be added to the sum total of capitalist
performance. Now if the system had another run such as it had in the
sixty years preceding 1928 and really reached the $1300 per head of
population, it is easy to see that all the desiderata that have so far been
espoused by any social reformers—practically without exception,
including even the greater part of the cranks—either would be fulfilled
automatically or could be fulfilled without significant interference with
the capitalist process. Ample provision for the unemployed in particular
would then be not only a tolerable but a light burden. Irresponsibility in
creating unemployment and in financing the support of the unemployed
might of course at any time create insoluble problems. But managed with
ordinary prudence, an average annual expenditure of 16 billions on an
average number of 16 million unemployed including dependents (10 per
cent of the population) would not in itself be a serious matter with an
available national income of the order of magnitude of 200 billion dollars
(purchasing power of 1928).

Unemployment is one of the most important issues in of capitalism.

<!-- 11 That series has often been charted and analyzed. See for instance, A.C.Pigou. Industrial
Fluctuations or my Business Cycles. For every country there seems to be an irreducible
minimum and, superimposed on that, a cyclical movement, the strongest component of which
has a period of about nine to ten years. -->

I do not think that unemployment is among those evils which, like poverty, capitalist evolution could ever eliminate of itself.
I also do not think that there is any tendency for the unemployment
percentage to increase in the long run. The only series covering a
respectable time interval—roughly the sixty years preceding the First
World War—gives the English trade-union percentage of unemployed
members. It is a typically cyclical series and displays no trend (or a horizontal one). 11 Since this is theoretically understandable—there is no
theoretical reason to call the evidence in question—those two propositions
seem established for the prewar time to 1913 inclusive. 

In the postwar time
and in most countries unemployment was mostly at an abnormally high
level even before 1930. But this and still more the unemployment during
the thirties can be accounted for on grounds that have nothing to do with
a long-run tendency of unemployment percentages to increase from causes
inherent in the capitalist mechanism itself. I have mentioned above those
industrial revolutions which are so characteristic of the capitalist process.
Supernormal unemployment is one of the features of the periods of
adaptation that follow upon the “prosperity phase” of each of them. We
observe it in the 1820’s and 1870’s, and the period after 1920 is simply
another of those periods. So far the phenomenon is essentially temporary
in the sense that nothing can be inferred about it for the future. But there
were a number of other factors which tended to intensify it—war effects,
dislocations of foreign trade, wage policies, certain institutional changes
that swelled the statistical figure, in England and Germany fiscal policies
(also important in the United States since 1935) and so on. Some of these
are no doubt symptoms of an “atmosphere” in which capitalism will work
with decreasing efficiency. That however is another matter which will
engage our attention later on.

But whether lasting or temporary, getting worse or not, unemployment
undoubtedly is and always has been a scourge. In the next part of this book
we shall have to list its possible elimination among the claims of the
socialist order to superiority. Nevertheless, I hold that the real tragedy is
not unemployment per se, but unemployment plus the impossibility of
providing adequately for the unemployed without impairing the conditions
of further economic development: for obviously the suffering and
degradation—the destruction of human values—which we associate with
unemployment, though not the waste of productive resources, would be
largely eliminated and unemployment would lose practically all its terror
if the private life of the unemployed were not seriously affected by their
unemployment. 

The indictment stands that in the past—say, roughly, to the end of the 19th century—the capitalist order was not only unwilling
but also quite incapable of guaranteeing this. But since it will be able to
do so if it keeps up its past performance for another half century this
indictment would in that case enter the limbo filled by the sorry specters
of child labor and sixteen-hour working days and five persons living in one
room which it is quite proper to emphasize when we are talking about the
past social costs of capitalist achievement but which are not necessarily
relevant to the balance of alternatives for the future. Our own time is somewhere between the disabilities of earlier stages in capitalist evolution
and the abilities of the system in full maturity. 

In this country at least, the
better part of the task could even now be accomplished without undue
strain on the system. The difficulties do not seem to consist so much in
the lack of a surplus sufficient to blot out the darkest hues in the picture:
they consist, on the one hand, in the fact that the unemployment figure has
been increased by anti-capitalist policies beyond what it need have been
in the thirties and, on the other hand, in the fact that public opinion as soon
as it becomes at all alive to the duty in question, immediately insists on
economically irrational methods of financing relief and on lax and wasteful
methods of administering it.

Much the same argument applies to the future—and to a great extent the
present—possibilities held out by capitalist evolution for the care of the aged
and sick, for education and hygiene and so on. Also, an increasing number
of commodities might reasonably be expected, from the standpoint of the
individual household, to pass out of the class of economic goods and to be
available practically up to the satiety point. This could be brought about
either by arrangements between public agencies and producing concerns or
by nationalization or municipalization, gradual progress with which would
of course be a feature of the future development even of an otherwise
unfettered capitalism.
