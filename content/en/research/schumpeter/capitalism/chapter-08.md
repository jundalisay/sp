What has been said so far is really sufficient to enable the reader to deal with the large majority of the practical cases he is likely to meet and to realize the inadequacy of most of those criticisms of the profit
economy which, directly or indirectly, rely on the absence of perfect
competition. 

Since, however, the bearing of our argument on some of those criticisms may not be obvious at a glance, it will be worth our while to elaborate a little in order to make a few points more explicit.

1. As a fact and as a threat, the impact of new things—new technologies for instance—on the existing structure of an
industry considerably reduces the long-run scope and importance of
practices that aim, through restricting output, at conserving established
positions and at maximizing the profits accruing from them. We must now
recognize the further fact that restrictive practices of this kind, as far as
they are effective, acquire a new significance in the perennial gale of
creative destruction, a significance which they would not have in a
stationary state or in a state of slow and balanced growth. In either of these
cases restrictive strategy would produce no result other than an increase
in profits at the expense of buyers except that, in the case of balanced
advance, it might still prove to be the easiest and most effective way of
collecting the means by which to finance additional investment. 1 But in the
process of creative destruction, restrictive practices may do much to steady
the ship and to alleviate temporary difficulties. 

This is in fact a very
familiar argument which always turns up in times of depression and, as
everyone knows, has become very popular with governments and their
economic advisers—witness the NRA. While it has been so much misused
and so faultily acted upon that most economists heartily despise it, those

<!-- 1 Theorists are apt to look upon anyone who admits this possibility as guilty of gross error,
and to prove immediately that financing by borrowing from banks or from private savers or, in
the case of public enterprise, financing from the proceeds of an income tax is much more
rational than is financing from surplus profits collected through a restrictive policy. For some
patterns of behavior they are quite right. For others they are quite wrong. I believe that both
capitalism and communism of the Russian type belong in the latter category. But the point is
that theoretical considerations, especially theoretical considerations of the shortrun kind, cannot
solve, although they contribute to the solution of, the problem which we shall meet again in
the next part. -->

same advisers who are responsible for this 2 invariably fail to see its much
more general rationale.

Practically any investment entails, as a necessary complement of
entrepreneurial action, certain safeguarding activities such as insuring or
hedging. Long-range investing under rapidly changing conditions,
especially under conditions that change or may change at any moment
under the impact of new commodities and technologies, is like shooting
at a target that is not only indistinct but moving—and moving jerkily at
that. Hence it becomes necessary to resort to such protecting devices as
patents or temporary secrecy of processes or, in some cases, long-period
contracts secured in advance. But these protecting devices which most
economists accept as normal elements of rational management 3 are only
special cases of a larger class comprising many others which most
economists condemn although they do not differ fundamentally from the
recognized ones.

If for instance a war risk is insurable, nobody objects to a firm’s
collecting the cost of this insurance from the buyers of its products. But
that risk is no less an element in long-run costs, if there are no facilities
for insuring against it, in which case a price strategy aiming at the same
end will seem to involve unnecessary restriction and to be productive of
excess profits. Similarly, if a patent cannot be secured or would not, if
secured, effectively protect, other means may have to be used in order to
justify the investment. Among them are a price policy that will make it
possible to write off more quickly than would otherwise be rational, or
additional investment in order to provide excess capacity to be used only
for aggression or defense. Again, if long-period contracts cannot be entered
into in advance, other means may have to be devised in order to tie
prospective customers to the investing firm.

In analyzing such business strategy ex visu of a given point of time, the
investigating economist or government agent sees price policies that seem
to him predatory and restrictions of output that seem to him synonymous
with loss of opportunities to produce. He does not see that restrictions of this
type are, in the conditions of the perennial gale, incidents, often unavoidable
incidents, of a long-run process of expansion which they protect rather than
impede. There is no more of paradox in this than there is in saying that motorcars are traveling faster than they otherwise would because they are
provided with brakes.

<!-- 2 In particular, it is easy to show that there is no sense, and plenty of harm, in a policy that
aims at preserving “price parities.”
3 Some economists, however, consider that even those devices are obstructions to progress
which, though perhaps necessary in capitalist society, would be absent in a socialist one. There
is some truth in this. But that does not affect the proposition that the protection afforded by
patents and so on is, in the conditions of a profit economy, on balance a propelling and not an
inhibiting factor. -->

2. This stands out most clearly in the case of those sectors of the economy
which at any time happen to embody the impact of new things and methods
on the existing industrial structure. The best way of getting a vivid and
realistic idea of industrial strategy is indeed to visualize the behavior of new
concerns or industries that introduce new commodities or processes (such as
the aluminum industry) or else reorganize a part or the whole of an industry
(such as, for instance, the old Standard Oil Company).
As we have seen, such concerns are aggressors by nature and wield the
really effective weapon of competition. Their intrusion can only in the
rarest of cases fail to improve total output in quantity or quality, both
through the new method itself—even if at no time used to full advantage—
and through the pressure it exerts on the preexisting firms. But these
aggressors are so circumstanced as to require, for purposes of attack and
defense, also pieces of armor other than price and quality of their product
which, moreover, must be strategically manipulated all along so that at any
point of time they seem to be doing nothing but restricting their output and
keeping prices high.

On the one hand, largest-scale plans could in many cases not
materialize at all if it were not known from the outset that competition
will be discouraged by heavy capital requirements or lack of experience,
or that means are available to discourage or checkmate it so as to gain
the time and space for further developments. Even the conquest of
financial control over competing concerns in otherwise unassailable
positions or the securing of advantages that run counter to the public’s
sense of fair play—railroad rebates—move, as far as long-run effects on
total output alone are envisaged, into a different light; 4 they may be
methods for removing obstacles that the institution of private property
puts in the path of progress. In a socialist society that time and space

<!-- 4 The qualification added removes, I think, any just cause for offense that the above
proposition might conceivably cause. In case that qualification is not explicit enough, I beg
leave to repeat that the moral aspect is in this case, as it must be in every case, entirely
unaffected by an economic argument. For the rest, let the reader reflect that even in dealing
with indubitably criminal actions every civilized judge and every civilized jury take account
of the ulterior purpose in pursuit of which a crime has occurred and of the difference it makes
whether an action that is a crime has or has not also effects they consider socially desirable.
Another objection would be more to the point. If an enterprise can succeed only by such
means, does not that prove in itself that it cannot spell social gain? A very simple argument
can be framed in support of this view. But it is subject to a severe ceteris paribus proviso. That
is to say, it holds for conditions which are just about equivalent to excluding the process of
creative destruction—capitalist reality. On reflection, it will be seen that the analogy of the
practices under discussion with patents is sufficient to show this.  -->

would be no less necessary. They would have to be secured by order of
the central authority.

On the other hand, enterprise would in most cases be impossible if it were
not known from the outset that exceptionally favorable situations are likely to
arise which if exploited by price, quality and quantity manipulation will produce
profits adequate to tide over exceptionally unfavorable situations provided these
are similarly managed Again this requires strategy that in the short run is often
restrictive. In the majority of successful cases this strategy just manages to serve
its purpose. In some cases, however, it is so successful as to yield profits far
above what is necessary in order to induce the corresponding investment. These
cases then provide the baits that lure capital on to untried trails. Their presence
explains in part how it is possible for so large a section of the capitalist world
to work for nothing: in the midst of the prosperous twenties just about half of
the business corporations in the United States were run at a loss, at zero profits,
or at profits which, if they had been foreseen, would have been inadequate to
call forth the effort and expenditure involved.

Our argument however extends beyond the cases of new concerns,
methods and industries. Old concerns and established industries, whether or
not directly attacked, still live in the perennial gale. Situations emerge in the
process of creative destruction in which many firms may have to perish that
nevertheless would be able to live on vigorously and usefully if they could
weather a particular storm. Short of such general crises or depressions,
sectional situations arise in which the rapid change of data that is
characteristic of that process so disorganizes an industry for the time being
as to inflict functionless losses and to create avoidable unemployment.
Finally, there is certainly no point in trying to conserve obsolescent industries
indefinitely; but there is point in trying to avoid their coming down with a
crash and in attempting to turn a rout, which may become a center of
cumulative depressive effects, into orderly retreat. Correspondingly there is,
in the case of industries that have sown their wild oats but are still gaining
and not losing ground, such a thing as orderly advance. 5

5 A good example illustrative of this point—in fact of much of our general argument—is
the postwar history of the automobile and the rayon industry. The first illustrates very well the
nature and value of what we might call “edited” competition. The bonanza time was over by
about 1916. A host of firms nevertheless crowded into the industry afterwards, most of which
were eliminated by 1925. From a fierce life and death struggle three concerns emerged that by
now account for over 80 per cent of total sales. They are under competitive pressure inasmuch
as, in spite of the advantages of an established position, an elaborate sales and service
organization and so on, any failure to keep up and improve the quality of their products or any
attempt at monopolistic combination would call in new competitors. Among themselves, the
three concerns behave in a way which should be called corespective rather than competitive:
they refrain from certain aggressive devices (which, by the way, would also be absent in perfect
competition); they keep up with each other and in doing so play for points at the frontiers. This

All this is of course nothing but the tritest common sense. But it is being
overlooked with a persistence so stubborn as sometimes to raise the question
of sincerity. And it follows that, within the process of creative destruction,
all the realities of which theorists are in the habit of relegating to books and
courses on business cycles, there is another side to industrial self-
organization than that which these theorists are contemplating. “Restraints
of trade” of the cartel type as well as those which merely consist in tacit
understandings about price competition may be effective remedies under
conditions of depression. As far as they are, they may in the end produce
not only steadier but also greater expansion of total output than could be
secured by an entirely uncontrolled onward rush that cannot fail to be
studded with catastrophes. Nor can it be argued that these catastrophes occur
in any case. We know what has happened in each historical case. We have a
very imperfect idea of what might have happened, considering the
tremendous pace of the process, if such pegs had been entirely absent.
Even as now extended however, our argument does not cover all cases of
restrictive or regulating strategy, many of which no doubt have that injurious
effect on the long-run development of output which is uncritically attributed
to all of them. And even in the cases our argument does cover, the net effect
is a question of the circumstances and of the way in which and the degree
to which industry regulates itself in each individual case. It is certainly as
conceivable that an all-pervading cartel system might sabotage all progress
as it is that it might realize, with smaller social and private costs, all that
perfect competition is supposed to realize. This is why our argument does
not amount to a case against state regulation. It does show that there is no
general case for indiscriminate “trust-busting” or for the prosecution of
everything that qualifies as a restraint of trade. Rational as distinguished from
vindictive regulation by public authority turns out to be an extremely delicate
problem which not every government agency, particularly when in full cry
has now gone on for upwards of fifteen years and it is not obvious that if conditions of
theoretically perfect competition had prevailed during that period, better or cheaper cars would
now be offered to the public, or higher wages and more or steadier employment to the workmen.
The rayon industry had its bonanza time in the twenties. It presents the features incident to
introducing a commodity into fields fully occupied before and the policies that impose
themselves in such conditions still more clearly than does the automobile industry. And there
are a number of other differences. But fundamentally the case is similar. The expansion in
quantity and quality of rayon output is common knowledge. Yet restrictive policy presided over
this expansion at each individual point of time.
6 Unfortunately, this statement is almost as effective a bar to agreement on policy as the
most thoroughgoing denial of any case for government regulation could be. In fact it may
embitter discussion. Politicians, public officers and economists can stand what I may politely
term the whole-hog opposition of “economic royalists.” Doubts about their competence, such
as crowd upon us particularly when we see the legal mind at work, are much more difficult
for them to stand.

against big business, can be trusted to solve. 6 But our argument, framed to
refute a prevalent theory and the inferences drawn therefrom about the
relation between modern capitalism and the development of total output, only
yields another theory, i.e., another outlook on facts and another principle by
which to interpret them. For our purpose that is enough. For the rest, the facts
themselves have the floor.

3. Next, a few words on the subject of Rigid Prices which has been
receiving so much attention of late. It really is but a particular aspect of the
problem we have been discussing. We shall define rigidity as follows: a price
is rigid if it is less sensitive to changes in the conditions of demand and
supply than it would be if perfect competition prevailed. 7

Quantitatively, the extent to which prices are rigid in that sense depends on
the material and the method of measurement we select and is hence a doubtful
matter. But whatever the material or method, it is certain that prices are not
nearly as rigid as they seem to be. There are many reasons why what in effect
is a change in price should not show in the statistical picture; in other words,
why there should be much spurious rigidity. I shall mention only one class of
them which is closely connected with the facts stressed by our analysis.
I have adverted to the importance, for the capitalist process in general and
for its competitive mechanism in particular, of the intrusion of new
commodities. Now a new commodity may effectively bring down the
preexisting structure and satisfy a given want at much lower prices per unit
of service (transportation service for instance), and yet not a single recorded
price need change in the process; flexibility in the relevant sense may be
accompanied by rigidity in a formal sense. There are other cases, not of this
type, in which price reduction is the sole motive for bringing out a new brand
while the old one is left at the previous quotation—again a price reduction
that does not show. Moreover, the great majority of new consumers’ goods—
particularly all the gadgets of modern life—are at first introduced in an
experimental and unsatisfactory form in which they could never conquer
their potential markets. Improvement in the quality of products is hence a
practically universal feature of the development of individual concerns and
of industries. Whether or not this improvement involves additional costs, a
constant price per unit of an improving commodity should not be called rigid
without further investigation.

Of course, plenty of cases of genuine price rigidity remain—of prices

7 This definition suffices for our purposes but would not be satisfactory for others. See
D.D.Humphrey’s article in the Journal of Political Economy, October 1937, and E.S.Mason’s
article in the Review of Economic Statistics, May 1938. Professor Mason has shown, among
other things, that contrary to a widespread belief price rigidity is not increasing or, at all events,
that it is no greater than it was forty years ago, a result which in itself suffices to invalidate
some of the implications of the current doctrine of rigidity.
Monopolistic Practices 93
which are being kept constant as a matter of business policy or which remain
unchanged because it is difficult to change, say, a price set by a cartel after
laborious negotiations. In order to appraise the influence of this fact on the
long-run development of output, it is first of all necessary to realize that this
rigidity is essentially a short-run phenomenon. There are no major instances
of long-run rigidity of prices. Whichever manufacturing industry or group
of manufactured articles of any importance we choose to investigate over a
period of time, we practically always find that in the long run prices do not
fail to adapt themselves to technological progress—frequently they fall
spectacularly in response to it 8
—unless prevented from doing so by monetary
events and policies or, in some cases, by autonomous changes in wage rates
which of course should be taken into account by appropriate corrections
exactly as should changes in quality of products. 9 And our previous analysis
shows sufficiently why in the process of capitalist evolution this must be so.
What the business strategy in question really aims at—all, in any case,
that it can achieve—is to avoid seasonal, random and cyclical fluctuations
in prices and to move only in response to the more fundamental changes
in the conditions that underlie those fluctuations. Since these more
fundamental changes take time in declaring themselves, this involves
moving slowly by discrete steps—keeping to a price until new relatively
durable contours have emerged into view. In technical language, this
strategy aims at moving along a step function that will approximate
trends. And that is what genuine and voluntary price rigidity in most
cases amounts to. In fact, most economists do admit this, at least by
implication. For though some of their arguments about rigidity would
hold true only if the phenomenon were a long-run one—for instance most
of the arguments averring that price rigidity keeps the fruits of
technological progress from consumers—in practice they measure and
discuss primarily cyclical rigidity and especially the fact that many prices
do not, or do not promptly, fall in recessions and depressions. The real
question is therefore how this short-run rigidity 10 may affect the long-run
development of total output. Within this question, the only really
8 They do not as a rule fall as they would under conditions of perfect competition. But this
is true only ceteris paribus, and this proviso robs the proposition of all practical importance. I
have adverted to this point before and shall return to it below (§ 5).
9 From a welfare standpoint, it is proper to adopt a definition different from ours, and to
measure price changes in terms of the hours of labor that are currently necessary to earn the
dollars which will buy given quantities of manufactured consumers’ goods, taking account of
changes of quality. We have already done this in the course of a previous argument. A long-
run downward flexibility is then revealed that is truly impressive. Changes in price level raise
another problem. So far as they reflect monetary influences they should be eliminated for most
of the purposes of an investigation into rigidity. But so far as they reflect the combined effect
of increasing efficiencies in all lines of production they should not.
Can Capitalism Survive?94
important issue is this: prices that stay up in recession or depression no
doubt influence the business situation in those phases of the cycles; if that
influence is strongly injurious—making matters much worse than they
would be with perfect flexibility all round—the destruction wrought each
time might also affect output in the subsequent recoveries and
prosperities and thus permanently reduce the rate of increase in total
output below what it would be in the absence of those rigidities. Two
arguments have been put forth in favor of this view.
In order to put the first into the strongest possible light, let us assume
that an industry which refuses to reduce prices in recession goes on selling
exactly the same quantity of product which it would sell if it had reduced
them. Buyers are therefore out of pocket by the amount to which the
industry profits from the rigidity. If these buyers are the kind of people
who spend all they can and it the industry or those to whom its net returns
go does not spend the increment it gets but either keeps it idle or repays
bank loans, then total expenditure in the economy may be reduced thereby.
If this happens, other industries or firms may suffer and if thereupon they
restrict in turn, we may get a cumulation of depressive effects. In other
words, rigidity may so influence the amount and distribution of national
income as to decrease balances or to increase idle balances or, if we adopt
a popular misnomer, savings. Such a case is conceivable. But the reader
should have little difficulty in satisfying himself 11 that its practical
importance, if any, is very small
The second argument turns on the dislocating effects price rigidity
may exert if, in the individual industry itself or elsewhere, it leads to an
additional restriction of output, i.e., to a restriction greater than that
which must in any case occur during depression. Since the most
important conductor of those effects is the incident increase in
unemployment—unstabilization of employment is in fact the indictment
most commonly directed against price rigidity—and the consequent
10 It should, however, be observed that this short run may last longer than the term
“short run” usually implies—sometimes ten years and even longer. There is not one
cycle, but there are many simultaneous ones of varying duration. One of the most
important ones lasts on the average about nine years and a half. Structural changes
requiring price adjustments do in important cases occur in periods of about that length.
The full extent of the spectacular changes reveals itself only in periods much longer
than this. To do justice to aluminum, rayon, or motorcar prices one must survey a
period of about forty-five years.
11 The best method of doing this is to work out carefully all the assumptions involved, not
only in the strong case imagined but also in the weaker cases that are less unlikely to occur in
practice. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the profit due to keeping prices up may be
the means of avoiding bankruptcy or at least the necessity of discontinuing operations, both of
which might be much more effective in starting a downward “vicious spiral” than is a possible
reduction in total expenditure. See the comments on the second argument.
Monopolistic Practices 95
decrease in total expenditure, this argument then follows in the tracks of
the first one. Its practical weight is considerably reduced, although
economists greatly differ as to the extent, by the consideration that in the
most conspicuous cases price rigidity is motivated precisely by the low
sensitiveness of demand to short-run price changes within the practicable
range. People who in depression worry about their future are not likely
to buy a new car even if the price were reduced by 25 per cent, especially
if the purchase is easily postponable and if the reduction induces
expectations of further reductions.
Quite irrespective of this however, the argument is inconclusive
because it is again vitiated by a ceteris paribus clause that is inadmissible
in dealing with our process of creative destruction. From the fact, so far
as it is a fact, that at more flexible prices greater quantities could ceteris
paribus be sold, it does not follow that either the output of the
commodities in question, or total output and hence employment, would
actually be greater. For inasmuch as we may assume that the refusal to
lower prices strengthens the position of the industries which adopt that
policy either by increasing their revenue or simply by avoiding chaos in
their markets—that is to say, so far as this policy is something more than
a mistake on their part—it may make fortresses out of what otherwise
might be centers of devastation. As we have seen before, from a more
general standpoint, total output and employment may well keep on a
higher level with the restrictions incident to that policy than they would
if depression were allowed to play havoc with the price structure. 12 In
other words, under the conditions created by capitalist evolution, perfect
and universal flexibility of prices might in depression further unstabilize
the system, instead of stabilizing it as it no doubt would under the
conditions envisaged by general theory. Again this is to a large extent
recognized in those cases in which the economist is in sympathy with the
interests immediately concerned, for instance in the case of labor and of
agriculture; in those cases he admits readily enough that what looks like
rigidity may be no more than regulated adaptation.
Perhaps the reader feels some surprise that so little remains of a
doctrine of which so much has been made in the last few years. The
rigidity of prices has become, with some people, the outstanding defect
of the capitalist engine and—almost—the fundamental factor in the
explanation of depressions. But there is nothing to wonder at in this.
Individuals and groups snatch at anything that will qualify as a discovery
lending support to the political tendencies of the hour. The doctrine of
12 The theorist’s way to put the point is that in depression demand curves might shift
downwards much more violently if all pegs were withdrawn from under all prices
Can Capitalism Survive?96
price rigidity, with a modicum of truth to its credit, is not the worst case
of this kind by a long way.
4. Another doctrine has crystallized into a slogan, viz., that in the era of
big business the maintenance of the value of existing investment—
conservation of capital—becomes the chief aim of entrepreneurial activity
and bids fair to put a stop to all cost-reducing improvement. Hence the
capitalist order becomes incompatible with progress.
Progress entails, as we have seen, destruction of capital values in the strata
with which the new commodity or method of production competes. In
perfect competition the old investments must be adapted at a sacrifice or
abandoned; but when there is no perfect competition and when each
industrial field is controlled by a few big concerns, these can in various ways
fight the threatening attack on their capital structure and try to avoid losses
on their capital accounts; that is to say, they can and will fight progress itself.
So far as this doctrine merely formulates a particular aspect of
restrictive business strategy, there is no need to add anything to the
argument already sketched in this chapter. Both as to the limits of that
strategy and as to its functions in the process of creative destruction, we
should only be repeating what has been said before. This becomes still
more obvious if we observe that conserving capital values is the same
thing as conserving profits. Modern theory tends in fact to use the
concept Present Net Value of Assets (=capital values) in place of the
concept of Profits. Both asset values and profits are of course not being
simply conserved but maximized.
But the point about the sabotage of cost-reducing improvement still calls
for comment in passing. As a little reflection will show, it is sufficient to
consider the case of a concern that controls a technological device—some
patent, say—the use of which would involve scrapping some or all of its
plant and equipment. Will it, in order to conserve its capital values, refrain
from using this device when a management not fettered by capitalist
interests such as a socialist management could and would use it to the
advantage of all?
Again it is tempting to raise the question of fact. The first thing a modern
concern does as soon as it feels that it can afford it is to establish a research
department every member of which knows that his bread and butter depends
on his success in devising improvements. This practice does not obviously
suggest aversion to technological progress. Nor can we in reply be referred
to the cases in which patents acquired by business concerns have not been
used promptly or not been used at all. For there may be perfectly good
reasons for this; for example, the patented process may turn out to be no
good or at least not to be in shape to warrant application on a commercial
Monopolistic Practices 97
basis. Neither the inventors themselves nor the investigating economists or
government officials are unbiased judges of this, and from their
remonstrances or reports we may easily get a very distorted picture. 13
But we are concerned with a question of theory. Everyone agrees that
private and socialist managements will introduce improvements if, with the
new method of production, the total cost per unit of product is expected to
be smaller than the prime cost per unit of product with the method actually
in use. If this condition is not fulfilled, then it is held that private
management will not adopt a cost-reducing method until the existing plant
and equipment is entirely written off, whereas socialist management would,
to the social advantage, replace the old by any new cost-reducing method
as soon as such a method becomes available, i.e., without regard to capital
values. This however is not so. 14
Private management, if actuated by the profit motive, cannot be
interested in maintaining the values of any given building or machine any
more than a socialist management would be. All that private management
tries to do is to maximize the present net value of total assets which is
equal to the discounted value of expected net returns. This amounts to
saying that it will always adopt a new method of production which it
believes will yield a larger stream of future income per unit of the
corresponding stream of future outlay, both discounted to the present, than
does the method actually in use. The value of past investment, whether or
not paralleled by a bonded debt that has to be amortized, does not enter
at all except in the sense and to the extent that it would also have to enter
into the calculation underlying the decisions of a socialist management. So
far as the use of the old machines saves future costs as compared with the
immediate introduction of the new methods, the remainder of their service
value is of course an element of the decision for both the capitalist and the
socialist manager; otherwise bygones are bygones for both of them and any
attempt to conserve the value of past investment would conflict as much
with the rules following from the profit motive as it would conflict with
the rules set for the behavior of the socialist manager.
13 Incidentally, it should be noticed that the kind of restrictive practice under discussion,
granted that it exists to a significant extent, would not be without compensatory effects on
social welfare. In fact, the same critics who talk about sabotage of progress at the same time
emphasize the social losses incident to the pace of capitalist progress, particularly the
unemployment which that pace entails and which slower advance might mitigate to some
extent. Well, is technological progress too quick or too slow for them? They had better make
up their minds.
14 It should be observed that even if the argument were correct, it would still be inadequate
to support the thesis that capitalism is, under the conditions envisaged, “incompatible with
technological progress.” All that it would prove is, for some cases, the presence of a lag of
ordinarily moderate length in the introduction of new methods.
Can Capitalism Survive?98
It is however not true that private firms owning equipment the value of
which is endangered by a new method which they also control—if they do
not control it, there is no problem and no indictment—will adopt the new
method only if total unit cost with it is smaller than prime unit cost with
the old one, or if the old investment has been completely written off
according to the schedule decided on before the new method presented
itself. For if the new machines when installed are expected to outlive the
rest of the period previously set for the use of the old machines, their
discounted remainder value as of that date is another asset to be taken
account of. Nor is it true, for analogous reasons, that a socialist
management, if acting rationally, would always and immediately adopt any
new method which promises to produce at smaller total unit costs or that
this would be to the social advantage.
There is however another element15 which profoundly affects behavior in
this matter and which is being invariably overlooked. This is what might be
called ex ante conservation of capital in expectation of further improvement.
Frequently, if not in most cases, a going concern does not simply face the
question whether or not to adopt a definite new method of production that
is the best thing out and, in the form immediately available, can be expected
to retain that position for some length of time. A new type of machine is in
general but a link in a chain of improvements and may presently become
obsolete. In a case like this it would obviously not be rational to follow the
chain link by link regardless of the capital loss to be suffered each time. The
real question then is at which link the concern should take action. The
answer must be in the nature of a compromise between considerations that
rest largely on guesses. But it will as a rule involve some waiting in order
to see how the chain behaves. And to the outsider this may well look like
trying to stifle improvement in order to conserve existing capital values. Yet
even the most patient of comrades would revolt if a socialist management
were so foolish as to follow the advice of the theorist and to keep on
scrapping plant and equipment every year.
5. I have entitled this chapter as I did because most of it deals with the
facts and problems that common parlance associates with monopoly or
monopolistic practice. So far I have as much as possible refrained from using
those terms in order to reserve for a separate section some comments on a
few topics specifically connected with them. Nothing will be said however
that we have not already met in one form or another.
(a) To begin with, there is the term itself. Monopolist means Single Seller.
15 There are of course many other elements. The reader will please understand that in
dealing with a few questions of principles it is impossible to do full justice to any of the
topics touched upon.
Monopolistic Practices 99
Literally therefore anyone is a monopolist who sells anything that is not in
every respect, wrapping and location and service included, exactly like what
other people sell: every grocer, or every haberdasher, or every seller of
“Good Humors” on a road that is not simply lined with sellers of the same
brand of ice cream. This however is not what we mean when talking about
monopolists. We mean only those single sellers whose markets are not open
to the intrusion of would-be producers of the same commodity and of actual
producers of similar ones or, speaking slightly more technically, only those
single sellers who face a given demand schedule that is severely independent
of their own action as well as of any reactions to their action by other
concerns. The traditional Cournot-Marshall theory of monopoly as extended
and amended by later authors holds only if we define it in this way and there
is, so it seems, no point in calling anything a monopoly to which that theory
does not apply.
But if accordingly we do define it like this, then it becomes evident
immediately that pure cases of long-run monopoly must be of the rarest
occurrence and that even tolerable approximations to the requirements of
the concept must be still rarer than are cases of perfect competition. The
power to exploit at pleasure a given pattern of demand—or one that
changes independently of the monopolist’s action and of the reactions it
provokes—can under the conditions of intact capitalism hardly persist for
a period long enough to matter for the analysis of total output, unless
buttressed by public authority, for instance, in the case of fiscal
monopolies. A modern business concern not so protected—i.e., even if
protected by import duties or import prohibitions—and yet wielding that
power (except temporarily) is not easy to find or even to imagine. Even
railroads and power and light concerns had first to create the demand for
their services and, when they had done so, to defend their market against
competition. Outside the field of public utilities, the position of a single
seller can in general be conquered—and retained for decades—only on the
condition that he does not behave like a monopolist. Short-run monopoly
will be touched upon presently.
Why then all this talk about monopoly? The answer is not without interest
for the student of the psychology of political discussion. Of course, the
concept of monopoly is being loosely used just like any other. People speak
of a country’s having a monopoly of something or other 16 even if the
16 These so-called monopolies have of late come to the fore in connection with the proposal
to withhold certain materials from aggressor nations. The lessons of this discussion have some
bearing upon our problem by way of analogy. At first, much was thought of the possibilities of
that weapon. Then, on looking more closely at it, people found their lists of such materials to
be shrinking, because it became increasingly clear that there are very few things that cannot
he either produced or substituted for in the areas in question. And finally a suspicion began to

industry in question is highly competitive and so on. But this is not all.
Economists, government agents, journalists and politicians in this country
obviously love the word because it has come to be a term of opprobrium
which is sure to rouse the public’s hostility against any interest so labeled.
In the Anglo-American world monopoly has been cursed and associated with
functionless exploitation ever since, in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, it was English administrative practice to create monopoly positions
in large numbers which, on the one hand, answered fairly well to the
theoretical pattern of monopolist behavior and, on the other hand, fully
justified the wave of indignation that impressed even the great Elizabeth.
Nothing is so retentive as a nation’s memory. Our time offers other and
more important instances of a nation’s reaction to what happened centuries
ago. That practice made the English-speaking public so monopoly-conscious
that it acquired a habit of attributing to that sinister power practically
everything it disliked about business. To the typical liberal bourgeois in
particular, monopoly became the father of almost all abuses—in fact, it
became his pet bogey. Adam Smith, 17 thinking primarily of monopolies of
the Tudor and Stuart type, frowned on them in awful dignity. Sir Robert
Peel—who like most conservatives occasionally knew how to borrow from
the arsenal of the demagogue—in his famous epilogue to his last period of
office that gave so much offense to his associates, spoke of a monopoly of
bread or wheat, though English grain production was of course perfectly
competitive in spite of protection. 18 And in this country monopoly is being
made practically synonymous with any large-scale business.
(b) The theory of simple and discriminating monopoly teaches that,
excepting a limiting case, monopoly price is higher and monopoly output
smaller than competitive price and competitive output. This is true
provided that the method and organization of production—and everything
else—are exactly the same in both cases. Actually however there are
superior methods available to the monopolist which either are not
dawn to the effect that even though some pressure can be exerted on them in the short run,
long-run developments might eventually destroy practically all that was left on the lists.
17 There was more excuse for that uncritical attitude in the case of Adam Smith and the
classics in general than there is in the case of their successors because big business in our sense
had not then emerged. But even so they went too far. In part this was due to the fact that they
had no satisfactory theory of monopoly which induced them not only to apply the term rather
promiscuously (Adam Smith and even Senior interpreted for instance the rent of land as a
monopoly gain) but also to look upon the monopolists’ power of exploitation as practically
unlimited which is of course wrong even for the most extreme cases.
18 This instance illustrates the way in which the term keeps on creeping into illegitimate
uses. Protection of agriculture and a monopoly of agrarian products are entirely different things.
The struggle was over protection and not over a non-existent cartel of either landowners or
farmers. But in fighting protection it was just as well to beat up for applause. And there was
evidently no simpler means of doing so than by calling protectionists monopolists

available at all to a crowd of competitors or are not available to them so
readily: for there are advantages which, though not strictly unattainable
on the competitive level of enterprise, are as a matter of fact secured only
on the monopoly level, for instance, because monopolization may
increase the sphere of influence of the better, and decrease the sphere of
influence of the inferior, brains, 19 or because the monopoly enjoys a
disproportionately higher financial standing. Whenever this is so, then
that proposition is no longer true. In other words, this element of the case
for competition may fail completely because monopoly prices are not
necessarily higher or monopoly outputs smaller than competitive prices
and outputs would be at the levels of productive and organizational
efficiency that are within the reach of the type of firm compatible with
the competitive hypothesis.
There cannot be any reasonable doubt that under the conditions of our
epoch such superiority is as a matter of fact the outstanding feature of
the typical large-scale unit of control, though mere size is neither
necessary nor sufficient for it. These units not only arise in the process
of creative destruction and function in a way entirely different from the
static schema, but in many cases of decisive importance they provide the
necessary form for the achievement. They largely create what they
exploit. Hence the usual conclusion about their influence on long-run
output would be invalid even if they were genuine monopolies in the
technical sense of the term.
Motivation is quite immaterial. Even if the opportunity to set monopolist
prices were the sole object, the pressure of the improved methods or of a
huge apparatus would in general tend to shift the point of the monopolist’s
optimum toward or beyond the competitive cost price in the above sense,
thus doing the work—partly, wholly, or more than wholly—of the
competitive mechanism,20 even if restriction is practiced and excess capacity
19 The reader should observe that while, as a broad rule, that particular type of superiority
is simply indisputable, the inferior brains, especially if their owners are entirely eliminated,
are not likely to admit it and that the public’s and the recording economists’ hearts go out to
them and not to the others. This may have something to do with a tendency to discount the
cost or quality advantages of quasi-monopolist combination that is at present as pronounced as
was the exaggeration of them in the typical prospectus or announcement of sponsors of such
combinations.
20 The Aluminum Company of America is not a monopoly in the technical sense as defined
above, among other reasons because it had to build up its demand schedule, which fact
suffices to exclude a behavior conforming to the Cournot-Marshall schema. But most
economists call it so and in the dearth of genuine cases we will for the purposes of this note
do the same. From 1890 to 1929 the price of the basic product of this single seller fell to
about 12 per cent or, correcting for the change in price level (B.L.S. index of wholesale
prices), to about 8.8 per cent. Output rose from 30 metric tons to 103,400. Protection by
patent ceased in 1909. Argument from costs and profits in criticism of this “monopoly” must
Can Capitalism Survive?102
is in evidence all along. Of course if the methods of production, organization
and so on are not improved by or in connection with monopolization as is
the case with an ordinary cartel, the classical theorem about monopoly price
and output comes into its own again. 21 So does another popular idea, viz.,
that monopolization has a soporific effect. For this, too, it is not difficult to
find examples. But no general theory should be built upon it. For, especially
in manufacturing industry, a monopoly position is in general no cushion to
sleep on. As it can be gained, so it can be retained only by alertness and
energy. What soporific influence there is in modern business is due to
another cause that will be mentioned later.
(c) In the short run, genuine monopoly positions or positions
approximating monopoly are much more frequent. The grocer in a village
on the Ohio may be a true monopolist for hours or even days during an
inundation. Every successful corner may spell monopoly for the moment.
A firm specializing in paper labels for beer bottles may be so
circumstanced—potential competitors realizing that what seem to be good
profits would be immediately destroyed by their entering the field—that it
can move at pleasure on a moderate but still finite stretch of the demand
curve, at least until the metal label smashes that demand curve to pieces.
New methods of production or new commodities, especially the latter, do
not per se confer monopoly, even if used or produced by a single firm. The
product of the new method has to compete with the products of the old ones
and the new commodity has to be introduced, i.e., its demand schedule has
to be built up. As a rule neither patents nor monopolistic practices avail
against that. But they may in cases of spectacular superiority of the new
device, particularly if it can be leased like shoe machinery; or in cases of
new commodities, the permanent demand schedule for which has been
established before the patent has expired.
Thus it is true that there is or may be an element of genuine monopoly
gain in those entrepreneurial profits which are the prizes offered by
capitalist society to the successful innovator. But the quantitative
importance of that clement, its volatile nature and its function in the
process in which it emerges put it in a class by itself. The main value to a
concern of a single seller position that is secured by patent or monopolistic
strategy does not consist so much in the opportunity to behave temporarily
take it for granted that a multitude of competing firms would have been about equally
successful in cost-reducing research, in the economical development of the productive
apparatus, in teaching new uses for the product and in avoiding wasteful breakdowns. This
is, in fact, being assumed by criticism of this kind, i.e., the propelling factor of modern
capitalism is being assumed away.
21 See however supra, § 1.

according to the monopolist schema, as in the protection it affords against
temporary disorganization of the market and the space it secures for long-
range planning. Here however the argument merges into the analysis
submitted before.
6. Glancing back we realize that most of the facts and arguments touched
upon in this chapter tend to dim the halo that once surrounded perfect
competition as much as they suggest a more favorable view of its alternative.
I will now briefly restate our argument from this angle.
Traditional theory itself, even within its chosen precincts of a stationary
or steadily growing economy, has since the time of Marshall and Edgeworth
been discovering an increasing number of exceptions to the old propositions
about perfect competition and, incidentally, free trade, that have shaken that
unqualified belief in its virtues cherished by the generation which flourished
between Ricardo and Marshall—roughly, J.S.Mill’s generation in England
and Francesco Ferrara’s on the Continent. Especially the propositions that a
perfectly competitive system is ideally economical of resources and allocates
them in a way that is optimal with respect to a given distribution of income—
propositions very relevant to the question of the behavior of output—cannot
now be held with the old confidence. 22
Much more serious is the breach made by more recent work in the field
of dynamic theory (Frisch, Tinbergen, Roos, Hicks and others). Dynamic
analysis is the analysis of sequences in time. In explaining why a certain
economic quantity, for instance a price, is what we find it to be at a given
moment, it takes into consideration not only the state of other economic
quantities at the same moment, as static theory does, but also their state at
preceding points of time, and the expectations about their future values. Now
the first thing we discover in working out the propositions that thus relate
quantities belonging to different points of time 23 is the fact that, once
equilibrium has been destroyed by some disturbance, the process of
establishing a new one is not so sure and prompt and economical as the old
theory of perfect competition made it out to be; and the possibility that the
very struggle for adjustment might lead such a system farther away from
instead of nearer to a new equilibrium. This will happen in most cases unless
the disturbance is small. In many cases, lagged adjustment is sufficient to
produce this result.
All I can do here is to illustrate by the oldest, simplest and most
22 Since we cannot enter into the subject, I will refer the reader to Mr. R.F. Kahn’s paper
entitled “Some Notes on Ideal Output” (Economic Journal for March 1935), which covers much
of this ground.
23 The term dynamics is loosely used and carries many different meanings. The above
definition was formulated by Ragnar Frisch.
Can Capitalism Survive?104
familiar example. Suppose that demand and intended supply are in
equilibrium in a perfectly competitive market for wheat, but that bad
weather reduces the crop below what farmers intended to supply. If price
rises accordingly and the farmers thereupon produce that quantity of
wheat which it would pay them to produce if that new price were the
equilibrium price, then a slump in the wheat market will ensue in the
following year. If now the farmers correspondingly restrict production,
a price still higher than in the first year may result to induce a still greater
expansion of production than occurred in the second year. And so on (as
far as the pure logic of the process is concerned) indefinitely. The reader
will readily perceive, from a survey of the assumptions involved, that no
great fear need be entertained of ever higher prices’ and ever greater
outputs’ alternating till doomsday. But even if reduced to its proper
proportions, the phenomenon suffices to show up glaring weaknesses in
the mechanism of perfect competition. As soon as this is realized much
of the optimism that used to grace the practical implications of the theory
of this mechanism passes out through the ivory gate.
But from our standpoint we must go further than that. 24 If we try to
visualize how perfect competition works or would work in the process of
creative destruction, we arrive at a still more discouraging result. This will
not surprise us, considering that all the essential facts of that process are
absent from the general schema of economic life that yields the traditional
propositions about perfect competition. At the risk of repetition I will
illustrate the point once more.
Perfect competition implies free entry into every industry. It is quite true,
within that general theory, that free entry into all industries is a condition
for optimal allocation of resources and hence for maximizing output. If our
economic world consisted of a number of established industries producing
familiar commodities by established and substantially invariant methods and
if nothing happened except that additional men and additional savings
combine in order to set up new firms of the existing type, then impediments
24 It should be observed that the defining feature of dynamic theory has nothing to do with
the nature of the economic reality to which it is applied. It is a general method of analysis rather
than a study of a particular process. We can use it in order to analyze a stationary economy,
just as an evolving one can be analyzed by means of the methods of statics (“comparative
statics”). Hence dynamic theory need not take, and as a matter of fact has not taken, any special
cognizance of the process of creative destruction which we have taken to be the essence of
capitalism. It is no doubt better equipped than is static theory to deal with many questions of
mechanism that arise in the analysis of that process. But it is not an analysis of that process
itself, and it treats the resulting individual disturbances of given states and structures just as it
treats other disturbances. To judge the functioning of perfect competition from the standpoint
of capitalist evolution is therefore not the same thing as judging it from the standpoint of
dynamic theory.
Monopolistic Practices 105
to their entry into any industry they wish to enter would spell loss to the
community. But perfectly free entry into a new field may make it impossible
to enter it at all. The introduction of new methods of production and new
commodities is hardly conceivable with perfect—and perfectly prompt—
competition from the start. And this means that the bulk of what we call
economic progress is incompatible with it. As a matter of fact, perfect
competition is and always has been temporarily suspended whenever
anything new is being introduced—automatically or by measures devised for
the purpose—even in otherwise perfectly competitive conditions.
Similarly, within the traditional system the usual indictment of rigid prices
stands all right. Rigidity is a type of resistance to adaptation that perfect and
prompt competition excludes. And for the kind of adaptation and for those
conditions which have been treated by traditional theory, it is again quite true
that such resistance spells loss and reduced output. But we have seen that
in the spurts and vicissitudes of the process of creative destruction the
opposite may be true: perfect and instantaneous flexibility may even produce
functionless catastrophes. This of course can also be established by the
general dynamic theory which, as mentioned above, shows that there are
attempts at adaptation that intensify disequilibrium.
Again, under its own assumptions, traditional theory is correct in holding
that profits above what is necessary in each individual case to call forth the
equilibrium amount of means of production, entrepreneurial ability included,
both indicate and in themselves imply net social loss and that business
strategy that aims at keeping them alive is inimical to the growth of total
output. Perfect competition would prevent or immediately eliminate such
surplus profits and leave no room for that strategy. But since in the process
of capitalist evolution these profits acquire new organic functions—I do not
want to repeat what they are—that fact cannot any longer be unconditionally
credited to the account of the perfectly competitive model, so far as the
secular rate of increase in total output is concerned.
Finally, it can indeed be shown that, under the same assumptions which
amount to excluding the most characteristic features of capitalist reality, a
perfectly competitive economy is comparatively free from waste and in
particular from those kinds of waste which we most readily associate with
its counterpart. But this does not tell us anything about how its account looks
under the conditions set by the process of creative destruction.

On the one hand, much of what without reference to those conditions
would appear to be unrelieved waste ceases to qualify as such when duly
related to them. The type of excess capacity for example that owes its
existence to the practice of “building ahead of demand” or to the practice
of providing capacity for the cyclical peaks of demand would in a regime of perfect competition be much reduced. But when all the facts of the case
are taken into consideration, it is no longer correct to say that perfect
competition wins out on that score. For though a concern that has to accept
and cannot set prices would, in fact, use all of its capacity that can produce
at marginal costs covered by the ruling prices, it does not follow that it would
ever have the quantity and quality of capacity that big business has created
and was able to create precisely because it is in a position to use it
“strategically.” Excess capacity of this type may—it does in some and does
not in other cases—constitute a reason for claiming superiority for a socialist
economy. But it should not without qualification be listed as a claim to
superiority of the perfectly competitive species of capitalist economy as
compared with the “monopoloid” species.

On the other hand, working in the conditions of capitalist evolution, the
perfectly competitive arrangement displays wastes of its own. The firm of
the type that is compatible with perfect competition is in many cases inferior
in internal, especially technological, efficiency. If it is, then it wastes
opportunities. It may also in its endeavors to improve its methods of
production waste capital because it is in a less favorable position to evolve
and to judge new possibilities. And, as we have seen before, a perfectly
competitive industry is much more apt to be routed—and to scatter the bacilli
of depression—under the impact of progress or of external disturbance than
is big business. In the last resort, American agriculture, English coal mining,
the English textile industry are costing consumers much more and are
affecting total output much more injuriously than they would if controlled,
each of them, by a dozen good brains.

Thus it is not sufficient to argue that because perfect competition is
impossible under modern industrial conditions—or because it always has
been impossible—the large-scale establishment or unit of control must be
accepted as a necessary evil inseparable from the economic progress which
it is prevented from sabotaging by the forces inherent in its productive
apparatus. What we have got to accept is that it has come to be the most
powerful engine of that progress and in particular of the long-run expansion
of total output not only in spite of, but to a considerable extent through, this
strategy which looks so restrictive when viewed in the individual case and
from the individual point of time. In this respect, perfect competition is not
only impossible but inferior, and has no title to being set up as a model of
ideal efficiency. It is hence a mistake to base the theory of government
regulation of industry on the principle that big business should be made to
work as the respective industry would work in perfect competition. And
socialists should rely for their criticisms on the virtues of a socialist economy
rather than on those of the competitive model.
