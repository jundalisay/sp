<!-- What has been said so far is really sufficient to enable the reader to deal with the large majority of the practical cases he is likely to meet and to realize the inadequacy of most of  -->

The criticisms against the profit economy are inadequate.

<!--  which, directly or indirectly, rely on the absence of perfect
competition.  -->

My argument on some of those criticisms might not be obvious.

So I will explain a few points.

1. Restricting output:
- conserves established positions
- maximizes profits

<!-- As a fact and as a threat, The impact of new things—new technologies for instance—on  -->

New things, such as new technologies, can impact the existing structure of an industry.
- This considerably reduces the practices that restrict output

<!-- long-run  scope and importance of  that aim, through  -->

Such effective restrictive practices gain significance in creative destruction.

They would not have such a significance in a state that is:
- stationary or
- of slow and balanced growth

In either of these cases, restrictive strategy would only increase profits at the expense of buyers.

In a balanced advance, it might be the easiest and most effective way of financing additional investment. 1 

But in the process of creative destruction, restrictive practices may do much to:
- steady the ship
- alleviate temporary difficulties.

<!-- 1 Theorists are apt to look upon anyone who admits this possibility as guilty of gross error,
and to prove immediately that financing by borrowing from banks or from private savers or, in
the case of public enterprise, financing from the proceeds of an income tax is much more
rational than is financing from surplus profits collected through a restrictive policy. For some
patterns of behavior they are quite right. For others they are quite wrong. I believe that both
capitalism and communism of the Russian type belong in the latter category. But the point is
that theoretical considerations, especially theoretical considerations of the shortrun kind, cannot
solve, although they contribute to the solution of, the problem which we shall meet again in
the next part. -->


This:
- always turns up during depressions.
- has become popular with governments and their economic advisers as seen in the National Recovery Administration.

The National Recovery Administration has been so much misused and so faultily acted upon.
- Most economists hate it

Those same advisers responsible for this fail to see its much more general rationale.

Any investment entails, as a necessary complement of entrepreneurial action, certain safeguarding activities such as insuring or hedging. 

Long-range investing under rapidly changing conditions is like shooting at a target moving jerkily.
- This is especially true under conditions that may change at any moment under the impact of new commodities and technologies,  
Hence it becomes necessary to resort to such protecting devices as:
- patents or temporary secrecy of processes or
- long-period contracts secured in advance

Most economists see these protecting devices as normal elements of rational management.
- These are only special cases of a larger class comprising many others which most economists condemn although they do not differ fundamentally from the recognized ones.

When a war risk is insurable, a firm can collect the cost of this insurance from the buyers of its products. 

<!-- But that risk is no less an element in long-run costs, -->

If there are no facilities for insuring against war, the firm might raise prices.
- This will result in the same restriction that produces excess profits

<!-- in which case a price strategy aiming at the same end will seem to involve unnecessary restriction and to be productive .  -->

If a patent cannot be secured then other means may have to be used to justify the investment, such as:
- a price policy that will make it possible to write off more quickly than would otherwise be rational, or 
-additional investment to provide excess capacity to be used only for aggression or defense. 

If long-period contracts cannot be entered into, other means may have to be devised to tie prospective customers.

The government then sees:
- price policies that seem predatory
- output restrictions that seem loss of opportunities to produce

The government does not see that restrictions of this type are, under perennial gale, unavoidable incidents of a long-run process of expansion which they protect rather than impede.

This is like motorcars traveling faster than usual because they have brakes.

<!-- 2 In particular, it is easy to show that there is no sense, and plenty of harm, in a policy that
aims at preserving “price parities.”
3 Some economists, however, consider that even those devices are obstructions to progress
which, though perhaps necessary in capitalist society, would be absent in a socialist one. There
is some truth in this. But that does not affect the proposition that the protection afforded by
patents and so on is, in the conditions of a profit economy, on balance a propelling and not an
inhibiting factor. -->


2. This stands out most clearly in the case of those sectors of the economy which at any time happen to embody the impact of new things and methods on the existing industrial structure. 

The best way to get a realistic idea of industrial strategy is to visualize the behavior of new industries that:
- introduce new commodities or processes (such as the aluminum industry) or
- reorganize an industry (such as, for instance, the old Standard Oil Company).

Such industries are aggressors and wield the weapon of competition. 

Their intrusion improves total output in quantity or quality through:
- the new method
- the pressure it exerts on the preexisting firms

But these aggressors require armor for attack and defense other than price and quality of their product.
<!-- which, moreover, must be strategically manipulated all along so that at any
point of time they seem to be doing nothing but restricting their output and
keeping prices high. -->

The largest-scale plans might not materialize at all because of:
- capital requirements
- lack of experience
<!-- or that means are available to discourage or checkmate it so as to gain
the time and space for further developments.  -->

The conquest to gain monopolistic financial control might run counter to the public’s sense of fair play.

<!--  over competing concerns in otherwise unassailable
positions or the securing of advantages that —railroad rebates—move, as far as long-run effects on
total output alone are envisaged, into a different light; 4  -->

They might be methods to remove obstacles that private property puts in the path of progress. 

In a socialist society, that time and space would be no less necessary.

They would have to be secured by order of the central authority.

<!-- 4 The qualification added removes, I think, any just cause for offense that the above
proposition might conceivably cause. In case that qualification is not explicit enough, I beg
leave to repeat that the moral aspect is in this case, as it must be in every case, entirely
unaffected by an economic argument. For the rest, let the reader reflect that even in dealing
with indubitably criminal actions every civilized judge and every civilized jury take account
of the ulterior purpose in pursuit of which a crime has occurred and of the difference it makes
whether an action that is a crime has or has not also effects they consider socially desirable.
Another objection would be more to the point. If an enterprise can succeed only by such
means, does not that prove in itself that it cannot spell social gain? A very simple argument
can be framed in support of this view. But it is subject to a severe ceteris paribus proviso. That
is to say, it holds for conditions which are just about equivalent to excluding the process of
creative destruction—capitalist reality. On reflection, it will be seen that the analogy of the
practices under discussion with patents is sufficient to show this.  -->
