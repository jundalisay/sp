What has been said so far is really sufficient to enable the reader to deal with the large majority of the practical cases he is likely to meet and to realize the inadequacy of most of those criticisms of the profit
economy which, directly or indirectly, rely on the absence of perfect
competition. 

Since, however, the bearing of our argument on some of those criticisms may not be obvious at a glance, it will be worth our while to elaborate a little in order to make a few points more explicit.

1. As a fact and as a threat, the impact of new things—new technologies for instance—on the existing structure of an industry considerably reduces the long-run scope and importance of practices that aim, through restricting output, at conserving established positions and at maximizing the profits accruing from them. We must now recognize the further fact that restrictive practices of this kind, as far as they are effective, acquire a new significance in the perennial gale of creative destruction, a significance which they would not have in a stationary state or in a state of slow and balanced growth. In either of these cases restrictive strategy would produce no result other than an increase in profits at the expense of buyers except that, in the case of balanced advance, it might still prove to be the easiest and most effective way of collecting the means by which to finance additional investment. 1 But in the process of creative destruction, restrictive practices may do much to steady the ship and to alleviate temporary difficulties.

<!-- 1 Theorists are apt to look upon anyone who admits this possibility as guilty of gross error,
and to prove immediately that financing by borrowing from banks or from private savers or, in
the case of public enterprise, financing from the proceeds of an income tax is much more
rational than is financing from surplus profits collected through a restrictive policy. For some
patterns of behavior they are quite right. For others they are quite wrong. I believe that both
capitalism and communism of the Russian type belong in the latter category. But the point is
that theoretical considerations, especially theoretical considerations of the shortrun kind, cannot
solve, although they contribute to the solution of, the problem which we shall meet again in
the next part. -->


This is in fact a very
familiar argument which always turns up in times of depression and, as
everyone knows, has become very popular with governments and their
economic advisers—witness the NRA. While it has been so much misused
and so faultily acted upon that most economists heartily despise it, those same advisers who are responsible for this 2 invariably fail to see its much
more general rationale.

Practically any investment entails, as a necessary complement of
entrepreneurial action, certain safeguarding activities such as insuring or
hedging. Long-range investing under rapidly changing conditions,
especially under conditions that change or may change at any moment
under the impact of new commodities and technologies, is like shooting
at a target that is not only indistinct but moving—and moving jerkily at
that. Hence it becomes necessary to resort to such protecting devices as
patents or temporary secrecy of processes or, in some cases, long-period
contracts secured in advance. But these protecting devices which most
economists accept as normal elements of rational management 3 are only
special cases of a larger class comprising many others which most
economists condemn although they do not differ fundamentally from the
recognized ones.

If for instance a war risk is insurable, nobody objects to a firm’s
collecting the cost of this insurance from the buyers of its products. But
that risk is no less an element in long-run costs, if there are no facilities
for insuring against it, in which case a price strategy aiming at the same
end will seem to involve unnecessary restriction and to be productive of
excess profits. Similarly, if a patent cannot be secured or would not, if
secured, effectively protect, other means may have to be used in order to
justify the investment. Among them are a price policy that will make it
possible to write off more quickly than would otherwise be rational, or
additional investment in order to provide excess capacity to be used only
for aggression or defense. Again, if long-period contracts cannot be entered
into in advance, other means may have to be devised in order to tie
prospective customers to the investing firm.

In analyzing such business strategy ex visu of a given point of time, the
investigating economist or government agent sees price policies that seem
to him predatory and restrictions of output that seem to him synonymous
with loss of opportunities to produce. He does not see that restrictions of this
type are, in the conditions of the perennial gale, incidents, often unavoidable
incidents, of a long-run process of expansion which they protect rather than
impede. There is no more of paradox in this than there is in saying that motorcars are traveling faster than they otherwise would because they are
provided with brakes.

<!-- 2 In particular, it is easy to show that there is no sense, and plenty of harm, in a policy that
aims at preserving “price parities.”
3 Some economists, however, consider that even those devices are obstructions to progress
which, though perhaps necessary in capitalist society, would be absent in a socialist one. There
is some truth in this. But that does not affect the proposition that the protection afforded by
patents and so on is, in the conditions of a profit economy, on balance a propelling and not an
inhibiting factor. -->

2. This stands out most clearly in the case of those sectors of the economy
which at any time happen to embody the impact of new things and methods
on the existing industrial structure. The best way of getting a vivid and
realistic idea of industrial strategy is indeed to visualize the behavior of new
concerns or industries that introduce new commodities or processes (such as
the aluminum industry) or else reorganize a part or the whole of an industry
(such as, for instance, the old Standard Oil Company).
As we have seen, such concerns are aggressors by nature and wield the
really effective weapon of competition. Their intrusion can only in the
rarest of cases fail to improve total output in quantity or quality, both
through the new method itself—even if at no time used to full advantage—
and through the pressure it exerts on the preexisting firms. But these
aggressors are so circumstanced as to require, for purposes of attack and
defense, also pieces of armor other than price and quality of their product
which, moreover, must be strategically manipulated all along so that at any
point of time they seem to be doing nothing but restricting their output and
keeping prices high.

On the one hand, largest-scale plans could in many cases not
materialize at all if it were not known from the outset that competition
will be discouraged by heavy capital requirements or lack of experience,
or that means are available to discourage or checkmate it so as to gain
the time and space for further developments. Even the conquest of
financial control over competing concerns in otherwise unassailable
positions or the securing of advantages that run counter to the public’s
sense of fair play—railroad rebates—move, as far as long-run effects on
total output alone are envisaged, into a different light; 4 they may be
methods for removing obstacles that the institution of private property
puts in the path of progress. In a socialist society that time and space

<!-- 4 The qualification added removes, I think, any just cause for offense that the above
proposition might conceivably cause. In case that qualification is not explicit enough, I beg
leave to repeat that the moral aspect is in this case, as it must be in every case, entirely
unaffected by an economic argument. For the rest, let the reader reflect that even in dealing
with indubitably criminal actions every civilized judge and every civilized jury take account
of the ulterior purpose in pursuit of which a crime has occurred and of the difference it makes
whether an action that is a crime has or has not also effects they consider socially desirable.
Another objection would be more to the point. If an enterprise can succeed only by such
means, does not that prove in itself that it cannot spell social gain? A very simple argument
can be framed in support of this view. But it is subject to a severe ceteris paribus proviso. That
is to say, it holds for conditions which are just about equivalent to excluding the process of
creative destruction—capitalist reality. On reflection, it will be seen that the analogy of the
practices under discussion with patents is sufficient to show this.  -->

would be no less necessary. They would have to be secured by order of
the central authority.
