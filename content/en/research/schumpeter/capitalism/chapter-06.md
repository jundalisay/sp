THE argument of the preceding chapter seems to be exposed to a reply
that is as damaging as it is obvious. The average rate of increase in total
available production that obtained during the sixty years preceding 1928 has
been projected into the future. 

So far as this was merely a device in order
to illustrate the significance of past development, there was nothing in this
procedure that could have shocked the statistical conscience. 

But as soon as
I implied that the following fifty years might actually display a similar
average rate of increase, I apparently did commit a statistical crime; it is, of
course, clear that a historical record of production over any given period does
not in itself justify any extrapolation at all,1 let alone an extrapolation over
half a century. 

It is therefore necessary to emphasize again that my
extrapolation is not intended to forecast the actual behavior of output in the
future. 

Beyond illustrating the meaning of past performance, it is merely
intended to give us a quantitative idea of what the capitalist engine might
conceivably accomplish if, for another half century, it repeated its past
performance—which is a very different matter. 

The question whether it can
be expected to do so will be answered quite independently of the
extrapolation itself. For this purpose we have now to embark upon a long
and difficult investigation.

Before we can discuss the chance of capitalism repeating its past
performance we must evidently try to find out in what sense the observed
rate of increase in output really measures that past performance. No doubt,
the period that furnished our data was one of comparatively unfettered
capitalism. But this fact does not in itself provide a sufficient link between
the performance and the capitalist engine. 
In order to believe that this was
more than coincidence we must satisfy ourselves first, that there is an
understandable relation between the capitalist order and the observed rate of
increase in output; second, that, given such a relation, the rate of increase

<!-- 1 This proposition holds, on general principles, for any historical time series, since the very
concept of historical sequence implies the occurrence of irreversible changes in the economic
structure which must be expected to affect the law of any given economic quantity. Theoretical
justification and, as a rule, statistical treatment are therefore necessary for even the most modest
extrapolations. It may however be urged that our case is somewhat favored by the fact that
within the comprehensive compound represented by the output series, idiosyncrasies of
individual items will to some extent cancel each other. -->

was actually due to it and not to particularly favorable conditions which had
nothing to do with capitalism.

These two problems must be solved before the problem of a “repetition
of performance” can arise at all. The third point then reduces to the question
whether there is any reason why the capitalist engine should, during the next
forty years, fail to go on working as it did in the past.
We shall deal with these three points in turn.
Our first problem may be reformulated as follows. On the one hand, we
have a considerable body of statistical data descriptive of a rate of
“progress” that has been admired even by very critical minds. On the other
hand, we have a body of facts about the structure of the economic system
of that period and about the way it functioned; from these facts, analysis
has distilled what is technically called a “model” of capitalist reality, i.e.,
a generalized picture of its essential features. We wish to know whether
that type of economy was favorable, irrelevant, or unfavorable to the
performance we observe and, if favorable, whether those features may be
reasonably held to yield adequate explanation of this performance. Waiving
technicalities as much as possible, we shall approach the question in a
common-sense spirit.

1. Unlike the class of feudal lords, the commercial and industrial
bourgeoisie rose by business success. Bourgeois society has been cast in a
purely economic mold: its foundations, beams and beacons are all made of
economic material. The building faces toward the economic side of life. Prizes
and penalties are measured in pecuniary terms. Going up and going down
means making and losing money. This, of course, nobody can deny. But I wish
to add that, within its own frame, that social arrangement is, or at all events
was, singularly effective. In part it appeals to, and in part it creates, a schema
of motives that is unsurpassed in simplicity and force. The promises of wealth
and the threats of destitution that it holds out, it redeems with ruthless
promptitude. Wherever the bourgeois way of life asserts itself sufficiently to
dim the beacons of other social worlds, these promises are strong enough to
attract the large majority of supernormal brains and to identify success with
business success. They are not proffered at random; yet there is a sufficiently
enticing admixture of chance: the game is not like roulette, it is more like
poker. They are addressed to ability, energy and supernormal capacity for
work; but if there were a way of measuring either that ability in general or
the personal achievement that goes into any particular success, the premiums
actually paid out would probably not be found proportional to either.
Spectacular prizes much greater than would have been necessary to call forth
the particular effort are thrown to a small minority of winners, thus propelling
much more efficaciously than a more equal and more “just” distribution would,

the activity of that large majority of businessmen who receive in return very
modest compensation or nothing or less than nothing, and yet do their utmost
because they have the big prizes before their eyes and overrate their chances
of doing equally well. Similarly, the threats are addressed to incompetence. But
though the incompetent men and the obsolete methods are in fact eliminated,
sometimes very promptly, sometimes with a lag, failure also threatens or
actually overtakes many an able man, thus whipping up everyone, again much
more efficaciously than a more equal and more “just” system of penalties
would. Finally, both business success and business failure are ideally precise.
Neither can be talked away.
One aspect of this should be particularly noticed, for future reference
as well as because of its importance for the argument in hand. In the way
indicated and also in other ways which will be discussed later on, the
capitalist arrangement, as embodied in the institution of private
enterprise, effectively chains the bourgeois stratum to its tasks. But it
does more than that. The same apparatus which conditions for
performance the individuals and families that at any given time form the
bourgeois class, ipso facto also selects the individuals and families that
are to rise into that class or to drop out of it. This combination of the
conditioning and the selective function is not a matter of course. On the
contrary, most methods of social selection, unlike the “methods” of
biological selection, do not guarantee performance of the selected
individual; and their failure to do so constitutes one of the crucial
problems of socialist organization that will come up for discussion at
another stage of our inquiry. For the time being, it should merely be
observed how well the capitalist system solves that problem: in most
cases the man who rises first into the business class and then within it is
also an able businessman and he is likely to rise exactly as far as his
ability goes—simply because in that schema rising to a position and
doing well in it generally is or was one and the same thing. This fact, so
often obscured by the auto-therapeutic effort of the unsuccessful to deny
it, is much more important for an appraisal of capitalist society and its
civilization than anything that can be gleaned from the pure theory of the
capitalist machine.
