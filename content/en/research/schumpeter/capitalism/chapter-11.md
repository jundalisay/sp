LEAVING the precincts of purely economic considerations, we now turn
to the cultural complement of the capitalist economy—to its socio-
psychological superstructure, if we wish to speak the Marxian language—
and to the mentality that is characteristic of capitalist society and in
particular of the bourgeois class. In desperate brevity, the salient facts may
be conveyed as follows.

50,000 years ago man confronted the dangers and opportunities
of his environment in a way which some “prehistorians,” sociologists and
ethnologists agree was roughly equivalent to the attitude of modern
primitives.1 Two elements of this attitude are particularly important for us:
the “collective” and “affective” nature of the primitive mental process and,
partly overlapping, the role of what, not quite correctly, I shall here call
magic. By the first I designate the fact that in small and undifferentiated or
not much differentiated social groups collective ideas impose themselves
much more stringently on the individual mind than they do in big and
complex groups; and that conclusions and decisions are arrived at by
methods which for our purpose may be characterized by a negative criterion:
the disregard of what we call logic and, in particular, of the rule that excludes
contradiction. By the second I designate the use of a set of beliefs which are
not indeed completely divorced from experience—no magic device can
survive an unbroken sequence of failures—but which insert, into the
sequence of observed phenomena, entities or influences derived from non-
empirical sources. 2 The similarity of this type of mental process with the

<!-- 1 Research of this type goes far back. But I believe that a new stage of it ought to be dated
from the works of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl. See in particular his Fonctions mentales dans les sociétés
inférieures (1909) and Le surnaturel et la nature dans la mentalité primitive (1931). There is a
long way between the position held in the first and the position held in the second work, the
milestones of which are discernible in Mentalité primitive (1921) and L’ame primitive (1927).
For us, Lévy-Bruhl is a particularly useful authority because he fully shares our thesis—in fact
his work starts from it—that the “executive” functions of thinking and the mental structure of
man are determined, partly at least, by the structure of the society within which they develop.
It is immaterial that, with Lévy-Bruhl, this principle hails not from Marx but from Comte.

2 A friendly critic of the above passage expostulated with me on the ground that I could
not possibly mean what it says because in that case I should have to call the physicist’s “force”
a magic device. That is precisely what I do mean, unless it is agreed that the term Force is
merely a name for a constant times the second time derivative of displacement. See the next
but one sentence in the text. -->

mental processes of neurotics has been pointed out by G.Dromard (1911; his
term, délire d’interpretation, is particularly suggestive) and S.Freud (Totem
und Tabu, 1913). But it does not follow that it is foreign to the mind of
normal man of our own time. On the contrary, any discussion of political
issues may convince the reader that a large and—for action—most important
body of our own processes is of exactly the same nature.
Rational thought or behavior and a rationalistic civilization therefore do
not imply absence of the criteria mentioned but only a slow though incessant
widening of the sector of social life within which individuals or groups go
about dealing with a given situation, first, by trying to make the best of it
more or less—never wholly—according to their own lights; second, by doing
so according to those rules of consistency which we call logic; and third, by
doing so on assumptions which satisfy two conditions: that their number be
a minimum and that every one of them be amenable to expression in terms
of potential experience. 3

All this is very inadequate of course but it suffices for our purpose. There
is however one more point about the concept of rationalist civilizations that
I will mention here for future reference. When the habit of rational analysis
of, and rational behavior in, the daily tasks of life has gone far enough, it
turns back upon the mass of collective ideas and criticizes and to some extent
“rationalizes” them by way of such questions as why there should be kings
and popes or subordination or tithes or property. Incidentally, it is important
to notice that, while most of us would accept such an attitude as the symptom
of a “higher stage” of mental development, this value judgment is not
necessarily and in every sense borne out by the results. The rationalist
attitude may go to work with information and technique so inadequate that
actions—and especially a general surgical propensity—induced by it may,
to an observer of a later period, appear to be, even from a purely intellectual
standpoint, inferior to the actions and anti-surgical propensities associated
with attitudes that at the time most people felt inclined to attribute to a low
I.Q. A large part of the political thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries illustrates this ever-forgotten truth. Not only in depth of social
vision but also in logical analysis later “conservative” countercriticism was
clearly superior although it would have been a mere matter of laughter for
the writers of the enlightenment.

The rational attitude forced itself on the human mind primarily from economic necessity.

It is the everyday economic task to which we as a race owe our elementary training in rational thought and behavior—
I have no hesitation in saying that all logic is derived from the pattern of

<!-- 3 This Kantian phrase has been chosen in order to guard against an obvious
objection. -->

the economic decision or, to use a pet phrase of mine, that the economic
pattern is the matrix of logic. 

This seems plausible for the following reason.

Suppose that some “primitive” man uses that most elementary of all
machines, already appreciated by our gorilla cousins, a stick, and that this
stick breaks in his hand. If he tries to remedy the damage by reciting a magic
formula—he might for instance murmur Supply and Demand or Planning
and Control in the expectation that if he repeats this exactly nine times the
two fragments will unite again—then he is within the precincts of pre-
rational thought. 

If he gropes for the best way to join the fragments or to
procure another stick, he is being rational in our sense. Both attitudes are
possible of course. But it stands to reason that in this and most other
economic actions the failure of a magic formula to work will be much more
obvious than could be any failure of a formula that was to make our man
victorious in combat or lucky in love or to lift a load of guilt from his
conscience. 

This is due to the inexorable definiteness and, in most cases, the
quantitative character that distinguish the economic from other spheres of
human action, perhaps also to the unemotional drabness of the unending
rhythm of economic wants and satisfactions. Once hammered in, the rational
habit spreads under the pedagogic influence of favorable experiences to the
other spheres and there also opens eyes for that amazing thing, the Fact.
This process is independent of any particular garb, hence also of the
capitalistic garb, of economic activity. So is the profit motive and self-
interest.
