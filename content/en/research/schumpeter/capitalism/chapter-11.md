LEAVING the precincts of purely economic considerations, we now turn
to the cultural complement of the capitalist economy—to its socio-
psychological superstructure, if we wish to speak the Marxian language—
and to the mentality that is characteristic of capitalist society and in
particular of the bourgeois class. In desperate brevity, the salient facts may
be conveyed as follows.

50,000 years ago man confronted the dangers and opportunities
of his environment in a way which some “prehistorians,” sociologists and
ethnologists agree was roughly equivalent to the attitude of modern
primitives.1 Two elements of this attitude are particularly important for us:
the “collective” and “affective” nature of the primitive mental process and,
partly overlapping, the role of what, not quite correctly, I shall here call
magic. By the first I designate the fact that in small and undifferentiated or
not much differentiated social groups collective ideas impose themselves
much more stringently on the individual mind than they do in big and
complex groups; and that conclusions and decisions are arrived at by
methods which for our purpose may be characterized by a negative criterion:
the disregard of what we call logic and, in particular, of the rule that excludes
contradiction. By the second I designate the use of a set of beliefs which are
not indeed completely divorced from experience—no magic device can
survive an unbroken sequence of failures—but which insert, into the
sequence of observed phenomena, entities or influences derived from non-
empirical sources. 2 The similarity of this type of mental process with the

<!-- 1 Research of this type goes far back. But I believe that a new stage of it ought to be dated
from the works of Lucien Lévy-Bruhl. See in particular his Fonctions mentales dans les sociétés
inférieures (1909) and Le surnaturel et la nature dans la mentalité primitive (1931). There is a
long way between the position held in the first and the position held in the second work, the
milestones of which are discernible in Mentalité primitive (1921) and L’ame primitive (1927).
For us, Lévy-Bruhl is a particularly useful authority because he fully shares our thesis—in fact
his work starts from it—that the “executive” functions of thinking and the mental structure of
man are determined, partly at least, by the structure of the society within which they develop.
It is immaterial that, with Lévy-Bruhl, this principle hails not from Marx but from Comte.

2 A friendly critic of the above passage expostulated with me on the ground that I could
not possibly mean what it says because in that case I should have to call the physicist’s “force”
a magic device. That is precisely what I do mean, unless it is agreed that the term Force is
merely a name for a constant times the second time derivative of displacement. See the next
but one sentence in the text. -->

mental processes of neurotics has been pointed out by G.Dromard (1911; his
term, délire d’interpretation, is particularly suggestive) and S.Freud (Totem
und Tabu, 1913). But it does not follow that it is foreign to the mind of
normal man of our own time. On the contrary, any discussion of political
issues may convince the reader that a large and—for action—most important
body of our own processes is of exactly the same nature.
Rational thought or behavior and a rationalistic civilization therefore do
not imply absence of the criteria mentioned but only a slow though incessant
widening of the sector of social life within which individuals or groups go
about dealing with a given situation, first, by trying to make the best of it
more or less—never wholly—according to their own lights; second, by doing
so according to those rules of consistency which we call logic; and third, by
doing so on assumptions which satisfy two conditions: that their number be
a minimum and that every one of them be amenable to expression in terms
of potential experience. 3

All this is very inadequate of course but it suffices for our purpose. There
is however one more point about the concept of rationalist civilizations that
I will mention here for future reference. When the habit of rational analysis
of, and rational behavior in, the daily tasks of life has gone far enough, it
turns back upon the mass of collective ideas and criticizes and to some extent
“rationalizes” them by way of such questions as why there should be kings
and popes or subordination or tithes or property. Incidentally, it is important
to notice that, while most of us would accept such an attitude as the symptom
of a “higher stage” of mental development, this value judgment is not
necessarily and in every sense borne out by the results. The rationalist
attitude may go to work with information and technique so inadequate that
actions—and especially a general surgical propensity—induced by it may,
to an observer of a later period, appear to be, even from a purely intellectual
standpoint, inferior to the actions and anti-surgical propensities associated
with attitudes that at the time most people felt inclined to attribute to a low
I.Q. A large part of the political thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries illustrates this ever-forgotten truth. Not only in depth of social
vision but also in logical analysis later “conservative” countercriticism was
clearly superior although it would have been a mere matter of laughter for
the writers of the enlightenment.

Now the rational attitude presumably forced itself on the human mind
primarily from economic necessity; it is the everyday economic task to which
we as a race owe our elementary training in rational thought and behavior—
I have no hesitation in saying that all logic is derived from the pattern of

<!-- 3 This Kantian phrase has been chosen in order to guard against an obvious
objection. -->

the economic decision or, to use a pet phrase of mine, that the economic
pattern is the matrix of logic. This seems plausible for the following reason.
Suppose that some “primitive” man uses that most elementary of all
machines, already appreciated by our gorilla cousins, a stick, and that this
stick breaks in his hand. If he tries to remedy the damage by reciting a magic
formula—he might for instance murmur Supply and Demand or Planning
and Control in the expectation that if he repeats this exactly nine times the
two fragments will unite again—then he is within the precincts of pre-
rational thought. If he gropes for the best way to join the fragments or to
procure another stick, he is being rational in our sense. Both attitudes are
possible of course. But it stands to reason that in this and most other
economic actions the failure of a magic formula to work will be much more
obvious than could be any failure of a formula that was to make our man
victorious in combat or lucky in love or to lift a load of guilt from his
conscience. This is due to the inexorable definiteness and, in most cases, the
quantitative character that distinguish the economic from other spheres of
human action, perhaps also to the unemotional drabness of the unending
rhythm of economic wants and satisfactions. Once hammered in, the rational
habit spreads under the pedagogic influence of favorable experiences to the
other spheres and there also opens eyes for that amazing thing, the Fact.
This process is independent of any particular garb, hence also of the
capitalistic garb, of economic activity. So is the profit motive and self-
interest. Pre-capitalist man is in fact no less “grabbing” than capitalist man.
Peasant serfs for instance or warrior lords assert their self-interest with a
brutal energy all their own. But capitalism develops rationality and adds a
new edge to it in two interconnected ways.

First it exalts the monetary unit—not itself a creation of capitalism—into
a unit of account. That is to say, capitalist practice turns the unit of money
into a tool of rational cost-profit calculations, of which the towering
monument is double-entry bookkeeping. 4 Without going into this, we will
notice that, primarily a product of the evolution of economic rationality, the
cost-profit calculus in turn reacts upon that rationality; by crystallizing and
defining numerically, it powerfully propels the logic of enterprise. And thus
defined and quantified for the economic sector, this type of logic or attitude

<!-- 4 This element has been stressed, and more suo overstressed, by Sombart. Double-entry
bookkeeping is the last step on a long and tortuous road. Its immediate predecessor was the
practice of making up from time to time an inventory and figuring out profit or loss; see
A.Sapori in Biblioteca Storica Toscana, VII. 1932. Luca Pacioli’s treatise on bookkeeping, 1494,
supplies by its date an important milestone. For the history and sociology of the state it is a
vital fact to notice that rational bookkeeping did not intrude into the management of public
funds until the eighteenth century and that even then it did so imperfectly and in the primitive
form of “cameralist” bookkeeping. -->


or method then starts upon its conqueror’s career subjugating—
rationalizing—man’s tools and philosophies, his medical practice, his picture
of the cosmos, his outlook on life, everything in fact including his concepts
of beauty and justice and his spiritual ambitions.

In this respect it is highly significant that modern mathematico-
experimental science developed, in the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, not only along with the social process usually referred to as the
Rise of Capitalism, but also outside of the fortress of scholastic thought and
in the face of its contemptuous hostility. In the fifteenth century mathematics
was mainly concerned with questions of commercial arithmetic and the
problems of the architect. The utilitarian mechanical device, invented by men
of the craftsman type, stood at the source of modern physics. The rugged
individualism of Galileo was the individualism of the rising capitalist class.
The surgeon began to rise above the midwife and the barber. 

The artist who
at the same time was an engineer and an entrepreneur—the type
immortalized by such men as Vinci, Alberti, Cellini; even Dürer busied
himself with plans for fortifications—illustrates best of all what I mean. By
cursing it all, scholastic professors in the Italian universities showed more
sense than we give them credit for. The trouble was not with individual
unorthodox propositions. Any decent schoolman could be trusted to twist his
texts so as to fit the Copernican system. But those professors quite rightly
sensed the spirit behind such exploits—the spirit of rationalist individualism,
the spirit generated by rising capitalism.

Second, rising capitalism produced not only the mental attitude of modern
science, the attitude that consists in asking certain questions and in going
about answering them in a certain way, but also the men and the means. By
breaking up the feudal environment and disturbing the intellectual peace of
manor and village (though there always was, of course, plenty to discuss and
to fall out about in a convent), but especially by creating the social space
for a new class that stood upon individual achievement in the economic field,
it in turn attracted to that field the strong wills and the strong intellects.
Precapitalist economic life left no scope for achievement that would carry
over class boundaries or, to put it differently, be adequate to create social
positions comparable to those of the members of the then ruling classes. Not
that it precluded ascent in general. 5 But business activity was, broadly
speaking, essentially subordinate, even at the peak of success within the craft
guild, and it hardly ever led out of it. The main avenues to advancement and
large gain were the church—nearly as accessible throughout the Middle Ages

<!-- 5 We are too prone to look upon the medieval social structure as static or rigid. As a matter
of fact, there was an incessant—to use Pareto’s term—circulation des aristocracies. The
elements that composed the uppermost stratum around 900 had practically disappeared by 1500. -->

as it is now—to which we may add the chanceries of the great territorial
magnates, and the hierarchy of warrior lords—quite accessible to every man
who was physically and psychically fit until about the middle of the twelfth
century, and not quite inaccessible thereafter. It was only when capitalist
enterprise—first commercial and financial, then mining, finally industrial—
unfolded its possibilities that supernormal ability and ambition began to turn
to business as a third avenue. Success was quick and conspicuous, but it has
been much exaggerated as regards the social weight it carried at first. If we
look closely at the career of Jacob Fugger, for instance, or of Agostino Chigi,
we easily satisfy ourselves that they had very little to do with steering the
policies of Charles V or of Pope Leo X and that they paid heavily for such
privileges as they enjoyed. 6 Yet entrepreneurial success was fascinating
enough for everyone excepting the highest strata of feudal society to draw
most of the best brains and thus to generate further success—to generate
additional steam for the rationalist engine. So, in this sense, capitalism—and
not merely economic activity in general—has after all been the propelling
force of the rationalization of human behavior.
And now we are at long last face to face with the immediate goal 7 to
which that complex yet inadequate argument was to lead. Not only the
modern mechanized plant and the volume of the output that pours forth from
it, not only modern technology and economic organization, but all the
features and achievements of modern civilization are, directly or indirectly,
the products of the capitalist process. They must be included in any balance
sheet of it and in any verdict about its deeds or misdeeds.
There is the growth of rational science and the long list of its applications.
Airplanes, refrigerators, television and that sort of thing are immediately
recognizable as results of the profit economy. But although the modern
hospital is not as a rule operated for profit, it is nonetheless the product of
capitalism not only, to repeat, because the capitalist process supplies the
means and the will, but much more fundamentally because capitalist
rationality supplied the habits of mind that evolved the methods used in these
hospitals. And the victories, not yet completely won but in the offing, over
cancer, syphilis and tuberculosis will be as much capitalist achievements as
6 The Medici are not really an exception. For though their wealth helped them to acquire
control of the Florentine commonwealth, it was this control and not the wealth per se which
accounts for the role played by the family. In any case they are the only merchants that ever
rose to a footing of equality with the uppermost stratum of the feudal world. Real exceptions
we find only where capitalist evolution created an environment or completely broke up the
feudal stratum—in Venice and in the Netherlands for instance.
7 The immediate goal, because the analysis contained in the last pages will stand us in good
stead also for other purposes. It is in fact fundamental for any serious discussion of the great
theme of Capitalism and Socialism.

motorcars or pipe lines or Bessemer steel have been. In the case of medicine,
there is a capitalist profession behind the methods, capitalist both because
to a large extent it works in a business spirit and because it is an emulsion
of the industrial and commercial bourgeoisie. But even if that were not so,
modern medicine and hygiene would still be by-products of the capitalist
process just as is modern education.
There is the capitalist art and the capitalist style of life. If we limit
ourselves to painting as an example, both for brevity’s sake and because in
that field my ignorance is slightly less complete than it is in others, and if
(wrongly, as I think) we agree to start an epoch with Giotto’s Arena frescoes
and then follow the line (nothing short of damnable though such “linear”
arguments are) Giotto—Masaccio—Vinci—Michelangelo—Greco, no
amount of emphasis on mystical ardors in the case of Greco can obliterate
my point for anyone who has eyes that see. And Vinci’s experiments are
offered to doubters who wish, as it were, to touch the capitalist rationality
with their fingertips. This line if projected (yes, I know) could be made to
land us (though perhaps gasping) in the contrast between Delacroix and
Ingres. Well, and there we are; Cézanne, Van Gogh, Picasso or Matisse will
do the rest. Expressionist liquidation of the object forms an admirably logical
conclusion. The story of the capitalist novel (culminating in the Goncourt
novel: “documents written up”) would illustrate still better. But that is
obvious. The evolution of the capitalist style of life could be easily—and
perhaps most tellingly—described in terms of the genesis of the modern
lounge suit.
There is finally all that may be grouped around the symbolic centerpiece
of Gladstonian liberalism. The term Individualist Democracy would do just
as well—better in fact because we want to cover some things that Gladstone
would not have approved and a moral and spiritual attitude which, dwelling
in the citadel of faith, he actually hated. At that I could leave this point if
radical liturgy did not consist largely in picturesque denials of what I mean
to convey. Radicals may insist that the masses are crying for salvation from
intolerable sufferings and rattling their chains in darkness and despair, but
of course there never was so much personal freedom of mind and body for
all, never so much readiness to bear with and even to finance the mortal
enemies of the leading class, never so much active sympathy with real and
faked sufferings, never so much readiness to accept burdens, as there is in
modern capitalist society; and whatever democracy there was, outside of
peasant communities, developed historically in the wake of both modern and
ancient capitalism. Again plenty of facts can be adduced from the past to
make up a counterargument that will be effective but is irrelevant in a
discussion of present condi tions and future alternatives.8 If we do decide to
The Civilization of Capitalism 127
embark upon historical disquisition at all, then even many of those facts
which to radical critics may seem to be the most eligible ones for their
purpose will often look differently if viewed in the light of a comparison
with the corresponding facts of pre-capitalist experience. And it cannot be
replied that “those were different times.” For it is precisely the capi talist
process that made the difference.
Two points in particular must be mentioned. I have pointed out before that
social legislation or, more generally, institutional change for the benefit of the
masses is not simply something which has been forced upon capitalist society
by an ineluctable necessity to alleviate the ever-deepening misery of the poor
but that, besides raising the standard of living of the masses by virtue of its
automatic effects, the capitalist process also provided for that legislation the
means “and the will.” The words in quotes require further explanation that is
to be found in the principle of spreading rationality. The capitalist process
rationalizes behavior and ideas and by so doing chases from our minds, along
with metaphysical belief, mystic and romantic ideas of all sorts. Thus it
reshapes not only our methods of attaining our ends but also these ultimate
ends themselves. “Free thinking” in the sense of materialistic monism, laicism
and pragmatic acceptance of the world this side of the grave follow from this
not indeed by logical necessity but nevertheless very naturally. On the one
hand, our inherited sense of duty, deprived of its traditional basis, becomes
focused in utilitarian ideas about the betterment of mankind which, quite
illogically to be sure, seem to withstand rationalist criticism better than, say,
the fear of God does. On the other hand, the same rationalization of the soul
rubs off all the glamour of super-empirical sanction from every species of
classwise rights. This then, together with the typically capitalist enthusiasm for
Efficiency and Service—so completely different from the body of ideas which
would have been associated with those terms by the typical knight of old—
breeds that “will” within the bourgeoisie itself. Feminism, an essentially
capitalist phenomenon, illustrates the point still more clearly. The reader will
realize that these tendencies must be understood “objectively” and that
therefore no amount of anti-feminist or anti-reformist talk or even of temporary
opposition to any particular measure proves anything against this analysis.
These things are the very symptoms of the tendencies they pretend to fight.
Of this, more in the subsequent chapters.
Also, capitalist civilization is rationalistic “and anti-heroic.” The two go
together of course. Success in industry and commerce requires a lot of
stamina, yet industrial and commercial activity is essentially unheroic in the
8 Even Marx, in whose time indictments of this kind were not anything like as absurd as
they are today, evidently thought it desirable to strengthen his case by dwelling on conditions
that even then were either past or visibly passing.
Can Capitalism Survive?128
knight’s sense—no flourishing of swords about it, not much physical
prowess, no chance to gallop the armored horse into the enemy, preferably
a heretic or heathen—and the ideology that glorifies the idea of fighting for
fighting’s sake and of victory for victory’s sake understandably withers in
the office among all the columns of figures. Therefore, owning assets that
are apt to attract the robber or the tax gatherer and not sharing or even
disliking warrior ideology that conflicts with its “rational” utilitarianism, the
industrial and commercial bourgeoisie is fundamentally pacifist and inclined
to insist on the application of the moral precepts of private life to
international relations. It is true that, unlike most but like some other features
of capitalist civilization, pacifism and international morality have also been
espoused in non-capitalist environments and by precapitalist agencies, in the
Middle Ages by the Roman Church for instance. Modern pacifism and
modern international morality are nonetheless products of capitalism.
In view of the fact that Marxian doctrine—especially Neo-Marxian
doctrine and even a considerable body of non-socialist opinion—is, as we
have seen in the first part of this book, strongly opposed to this proposition 9
it is necessary to point out that the latter is not meant to deny that many a
bourgeoisie has put up a splendid fight for hearth and home, or that almost
purely bourgeois commonwealths were often aggressive when it seemed to
pay—like the Athenian or the Venetian commonwealths—or that no
bourgeoisie ever disliked war profits and advantages to trade accruing from
conquest or refused to be trained in warlike nationalism by its feudal masters
or leaders or by the propaganda of some specially interested group. All I hold
is, first, that such instances of capitalist combativeness are not, as Marxism
has it, to be explained—exclusively or primarily—in terms of class interests
or class situations that systematically engender capitalist wars of conquest;
second, that there is a difference between doing that which you consider your
normal business in life, for which you prepare yourself in season and out of
season and in terms of which you define your success or failure, and doing
what is not in your line, for which your normal work and your mentality do
not fit you and success in which will increase the prestige of the most
unbourgeois of professions; and third, that this difference steadily tells—in
international as well as in domestic affairs—against the use of military force
and for peaceful arrangements, even where the balance of pecuniary
advantage is clearly on the side of war which, under modern circumstances,
is not in general very likely. As a matter of fact, the more completely
capitalist the structure and attitude of a nation, the more pacifist—and the
more prone to count the costs of war—we observe it to be. 

9 See our discussion of the Marxian theory of imperialism, Part I, ch. iv.

Owing to the complex nature of every individual pattern, this could be fully brought out
only by detailed historical analysis. But the bourgeois attitude to the military
(standing armies), the spirit in which and the methods by which bourgeois
societies wage war, and the readiness with which, in any serious case of
prolonged warfare, they submit to non-bourgeois rule are conclusive in
themselves. The Marxist theory that imperialism is the last stage of capitalist
evolution therefore fails quite irrespective of purely economic objections.
But I am not going to sum up as the reader presumably expects me to.
That is to say, I am not going to invite him, before he decides to put his
trust in an untried alternative advocated by untried men, to look once more
at the impressive economic and the still more impressive cultural
achievement of the capitalist order and at the immense promise held out
by both. I am not going to argue that that achievement and that promise
are in themselves sufficient to support an argument for allowing the
capitalist process to work on and, as it might easily be put, to lift poverty
from the shoulders of mankind.

There would be no sense in this. Even if mankind were as free to choose
as a businessman is free to choose between two competing pieces of
machinery, no determined value judgment necessarily follows from the facts
and relations between facts that I have tried to convey. As regards the
economic performance, it does not follow that men are “happier” or even
“better off” in the industrial society of today than they were in a medieval
manor or village. As regards the cultural performance, one may accept every
word I have written and yet hate it—its utilitarianism and the wholesale
destruction of Meanings incident to it—from the bottom of one’s heart.
Moreover, as I shall have to emphasize again in our discussion of the
socialist alternative, one may care less for the efficiency of the capitalist
process in producing economic and cultural values than for the kind of
human beings that it turns out and then leaves to their own devices, free to
make a mess of their lives. There is a type of radical whose adverse verdict
about capitalist civilization rests on nothing except stupidity, ignorance or
irresponsibility, who is unable or unwilling to grasp the most obvious facts,
let alone their wider implications. But a completely adverse verdict may also
be arrived at on a higher plane.

However, whether favorable or unfavorable, value judgments about
capitalist performance are of little interest. For mankind is not free to choose.
This is not only because the mass of people are not in a position to compare
alternatives rationally and always accept what they are being told. There is
a much deeper reason for it. Things economic and social move by their own
momentum and the ensuing situations compel individuals and groups to
behave in certain ways whatever they may wish to do—not indeed by destroying their freedom of choice but by shaping the choosing mentalities
and by narrowing the list of possibilities from which to choose. If this is the
quintessence of Marxism then we all of us have got to be Marxists. In
consequence, capitalist performance is not even relevant for prognosis. Most
civilizations have disappeared before they had time to fill to the full the
measure of their promise. Hence I am not going to argue, on the strength of
that performance, that the capitalist intermezzo is likely to be prolonged. In
fact, I am now going to draw the exactly opposite inference.
