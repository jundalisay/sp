3. "Rigid Prices" has been receiving so much attention recently.

I define Rigidity as a price that is less sensitive to changes in the conditions of demand and supply than it would be if perfect competition prevailed. 7

Quantitatively, the extent to which prices are rigid in that sense depends on
the material and the method of measurement we select and is hence a doubtful
matter. But whatever the material or method, it is certain that prices are not
nearly as rigid as they seem to be. There are many reasons why what in effect
is a change in price should not show in the statistical picture; in other words,
why there should be much spurious rigidity. I shall mention only one class of
them which is closely connected with the facts stressed by our analysis.

I have adverted to the importance, for the capitalist process in general and
for its competitive mechanism in particular, of the intrusion of new
commodities. Now a new commodity may effectively bring down the
preexisting structure and satisfy a given want at much lower prices per unit
of service (transportation service for instance), and yet not a single recorded
price need change in the process; flexibility in the relevant sense may be
accompanied by rigidity in a formal sense. There are other cases, not of this
type, in which price reduction is the sole motive for bringing out a new brand
while the old one is left at the previous quotation—again a price reduction
that does not show. Moreover, the great majority of new consumers’ goods—
particularly all the gadgets of modern life—are at first introduced in an
experimental and unsatisfactory form in which they could never conquer
their potential markets. Improvement in the quality of products is hence a
practically universal feature of the development of individual concerns and
of industries. Whether or not this improvement involves additional costs, a
constant price per unit of an improving commodity should not be called rigid
without further investigation.



<!-- 7 This definition suffices for our purposes but would not be satisfactory for others. See
D.D.Humphrey’s article in the Journal of Political Economy, October 1937, and E.S.Mason’s
article in the Review of Economic Statistics, May 1938. Professor Mason has shown, among
other things, that contrary to a widespread belief price rigidity is not increasing or, at all events,
that it is no greater than it was forty years ago, a result which in itself suffices to invalidate
some of the implications of the current doctrine of rigidity. -->


Of course, plenty of cases of genuine price rigidity remain—of prices which are being kept constant as a matter of business policy or which remain
unchanged because it is difficult to change, say, a price set by a cartel after
laborious negotiations. In order to appraise the influence of this fact on the
long-run development of output, it is first of all necessary to realize that this
rigidity is essentially a short-run phenomenon. There are no major instances
of long-run rigidity of prices. Whichever manufacturing industry or group
of manufactured articles of any importance we choose to investigate over a
period of time, we practically always find that in the long run prices do not
fail to adapt themselves to technological progress—frequently they fall
spectacularly in response to it 8 —unless prevented from doing so by monetary
events and policies or, in some cases, by autonomous changes in wage rates
which of course should be taken into account by appropriate corrections
exactly as should changes in quality of products. 9 And our previous analysis
shows sufficiently why in the process of capitalist evolution this must be so.

What the business strategy in question really aims at—all, in any case,
that it can achieve—is to avoid seasonal, random and cyclical fluctuations
in prices and to move only in response to the more fundamental changes
in the conditions that underlie those fluctuations. Since these more
fundamental changes take time in declaring themselves, this involves
moving slowly by discrete steps—keeping to a price until new relatively
durable contours have emerged into view. In technical language, this
strategy aims at moving along a step function that will approximate
trends. And that is what genuine and voluntary price rigidity in most
cases amounts to. In fact, most economists do admit this, at least by
implication. For though some of their arguments about rigidity would
hold true only if the phenomenon were a long-run one—for instance most
of the arguments averring that price rigidity keeps the fruits of
technological progress from consumers—in practice they measure and
discuss primarily cyclical rigidity and especially the fact that many prices
do not, or do not promptly, fall in recessions and depressions. 



<!-- 8 They do not as a rule fall as they would under conditions of perfect competition. But this
is true only ceteris paribus, and this proviso robs the proposition of all practical importance. I
have adverted to this point before and shall return to it below (§ 5).

9 From a welfare standpoint, it is proper to adopt a definition different from ours, and to
measure price changes in terms of the hours of labor that are currently necessary to earn the
dollars which will buy given quantities of manufactured consumers’ goods, taking account of
changes of quality. We have already done this in the course of a previous argument. A long-
run downward flexibility is then revealed that is truly impressive. Changes in price level raise
another problem. So far as they reflect monetary influences they should be eliminated for most
of the purposes of an investigation into rigidity. But so far as they reflect the combined effect
of increasing efficiencies in all lines of production they should not. -->

The real
question is therefore how this short-run rigidity 10 may affect the long-run
development of total output. Within this question, the only really important issue is this: prices that stay up in recession or depression no
doubt influence the business situation in those phases of the cycles; if that
influence is strongly injurious—making matters much worse than they
would be with perfect flexibility all round—the destruction wrought each
time might also affect output in the subsequent recoveries and
prosperities and thus permanently reduce the rate of increase in total
output below what it would be in the absence of those rigidities. Two
arguments have been put forth in favor of this view.

In order to put the first into the strongest possible light, let us assume
that an industry which refuses to reduce prices in recession goes on selling
exactly the same quantity of product which it would sell if it had reduced
them. Buyers are therefore out of pocket by the amount to which the
industry profits from the rigidity. If these buyers are the kind of people
who spend all they can and it the industry or those to whom its net returns
go does not spend the increment it gets but either keeps it idle or repays
bank loans, then total expenditure in the economy may be reduced thereby.
If this happens, other industries or firms may suffer and if thereupon they
restrict in turn, we may get a cumulation of depressive effects. In other
words, rigidity may so influence the amount and distribution of national
income as to decrease balances or to increase idle balances or, if we adopt
a popular misnomer, savings. 

Such a case is conceivable. But the reader
should have little difficulty in satisfying himself 11 that its practical
importance, if any, is very small
The second argument turns on the dislocating effects price rigidity
may exert if, in the individual industry itself or elsewhere, it leads to an
additional restriction of output, i.e., to a restriction greater than that
which must in any case occur during depression. Since the most
important conductor of those effects is the incident increase in
unemployment—unstabilization of employment is in fact the indictment
most commonly directed against price rigidity—and the consequent
decrease in total expenditure, this argument then follows in the tracks of
the first one. Its practical weight is considerably reduced, although
economists greatly differ as to the extent, by the consideration that in the
most conspicuous cases price rigidity is motivated precisely by the low
sensitiveness of demand to short-run price changes within the practicable
range. People who in depression worry about their future are not likely
to buy a new car even if the price were reduced by 25 per cent, especially
if the purchase is easily postponable and if the reduction induces
expectations of further reductions.

<!-- 10 It should, however, be observed that this short run may last longer than the term
“short run” usually implies—sometimes ten years and even longer. There is not one
cycle, but there are many simultaneous ones of varying duration. One of the most
important ones lasts on the average about nine years and a half. Structural changes
requiring price adjustments do in important cases occur in periods of about that length.
The full extent of the spectacular changes reveals itself only in periods much longer
than this. To do justice to aluminum, rayon, or motorcar prices one must survey a
period of about forty-five years.

11 The best method of doing this is to work out carefully all the assumptions involved, not
only in the strong case imagined but also in the weaker cases that are less unlikely to occur in
practice. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the profit due to keeping prices up may be
the means of avoiding bankruptcy or at least the necessity of discontinuing operations, both of
which might be much more effective in starting a downward “vicious spiral” than is a possible
reduction in total expenditure. See the comments on the second argument. -->


Quite irrespective of this however, the argument is inconclusive
because it is again vitiated by a ceteris paribus clause that is inadmissible
in dealing with our process of creative destruction. From the fact, so far
as it is a fact, that at more flexible prices greater quantities could ceteris
paribus be sold, it does not follow that either the output of the
commodities in question, or total output and hence employment, would
actually be greater. For inasmuch as we may assume that the refusal to
lower prices strengthens the position of the industries which adopt that
policy either by increasing their revenue or simply by avoiding chaos in
their markets—that is to say, so far as this policy is something more than
a mistake on their part—it may make fortresses out of what otherwise
might be centers of devastation. As we have seen before, from a more
general standpoint, total output and employment may well keep on a
higher level with the restrictions incident to that policy than they would
if depression were allowed to play havoc with the price structure. 12 In
other words, under the conditions created by capitalist evolution, perfect
and universal flexibility of prices might in depression further unstabilize
the system, instead of stabilizing it as it no doubt would under the
conditions envisaged by general theory. Again this is to a large extent
recognized in those cases in which the economist is in sympathy with the
interests immediately concerned, for instance in the case of labor and of
agriculture; in those cases he admits readily enough that what looks like
rigidity may be no more than regulated adaptation.

Perhaps the reader feels some surprise that so little remains of a
doctrine of which so much has been made in the last few years. The
rigidity of prices has become, with some people, the outstanding defect
of the capitalist engine and—almost—the fundamental factor in the
explanation of depressions. But there is nothing to wonder at in this.
Individuals and groups snatch at anything that will qualify as a discovery
lending support to the political tendencies of the hour. 

<!-- 12 The theorist’s way to put the point is that in depression demand curves might shift
downwards much more violently if all pegs were withdrawn from under all prices -->

The doctrine of price rigidity, with a modicum of truth to its credit, is not the worst case
of this kind by a long way.
