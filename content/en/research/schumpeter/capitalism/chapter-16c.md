4. But no great difficulties arise if we go beyond the precincts of the
theory of the stationary process and admit the phenomena incident to
industrial change. 

So far as economic logic is concerned, it cannot be held
that socialism of the kind envisaged, while theoretically capable of coping
with the recurrent tasks of the administration of a stationary economy, would
necessarily fail in the solution of the problems presented by “progress.” We
shall see later why it is nevertheless important for the success of a socialist
society that it should embark upon its career not only as richly endowed as
possible by its capitalist predecessor—with experience and techniques as
well as with resources—but also after the latter has sown its wild oats, done
its work and is approaching a stationary state. But the reason for it is not in
any inability of ours to devise a rational and uniquely determined course for
the socialist society to take whenever the opportunity for an improvement
in the industrial apparatus presents itself.

Suppose that a new and more efficient piece of machinery has been designed
for the productive process of industry X. In order to exclude the problems
incident to the financing of investment—to be considered presently—and to
isolate a distinct set of phenomena, we will assume that the new machine can
be produced by the same plants which thus far produced the less efficient one
and at exactly the same costs in terms of productive resources. The management
of industry X, in obedience to the first clause of its instruction—viz., the rule
to produce as economically as possible—will adopt the new machine and thus
produce the same output with a smaller amount of means of production than
heretofore. 

Consequently it would henceforth be in a position to transfer to the
ministry or central board an amount of consumers’ dollars smaller than the
amount received from consumers. Call the difference as you please, for instance
D, or a shovel, or “profits.” The management would, it is true, violate the
condition set by the third clause of its instruction if it realized that “profit”; and
if it obeys that clause and immediately produces the greater amount now required
in order to satisfy that condition, those profits will never emerge. But their
potential existence in the calculations of the management is quite sufficient to
make them fill the only function they would have under our assumption, viz.,
the function of indicating, in a uniquely determined manner, the direction and
extent of the reallocation of resources that it is now rational to carry out.

If, at a time when the available resources of the society are fully employed
in the task of providing a given level of consumption, an improvement—such
as a new bridge or a new railway—which requires the use of additional
factors or, as we may also say, additional investment suggests itself, the
comrades would either have to work beyond the hours which so far we have
assumed to be fixed by law or to restrict their consumption or both. 

In this
case our assumptions, framed for the purpose of solving the fundamental
problem in the simplest possible way, preclude an “automatic” solution, i.e.,
a decision at which the central board and the industrial managements could
arrive merely by passively following, within the three rules, the guidance of
objective indications. But this of course is a disability of our schema and not
of the socialist economy. All we have to do if we wish to have such an
automatic solution is to repeal the law invalidating all claims to consumers’
goods that are not used during the period for which they are issued, to
renounce the principle of absolute equality of incomes and to grant power
to the central board to offer premiums for overtime and—what shall we call
it?—well, let us say saving. The condition that possible improvements or
investments be undertaken to such an extent that the least tempting one of
them would yield a “profit” equal to the premiums which have to be offered
in order to call forth the amounts of overtime or saving (or both) required
for it, then uniquely determines all the new variables that our problem
introduces provided overtime and saving are in the relevant interval single-
valued functions of the respective premiums. 7 The “dollars” that are handed
out in discharge of the latter may conveniently be assumed to be additional
to the income dollars issued before. The readjustments this would impose
in various directions need not detain us.

But this argument about investment makes it still clearer that the schema
which seemed best adapted to our particular purpose is neither the only
possible blueprint of a socialist economy, nor necessarily the. one that would
recommend itself to a socialist society. Socialism need not be equalitarian
but no amount of inequality of incomes that we could reasonably expect a
socialist society to tolerate is likely to produce the rate of investment that
capitalist society produces in the average of cyclical phases. Even capitalist
inequalities are not sufficient for that and they have to be reinforced by
corporate accumulation and “created” bank credit, methods which are not
particularly automatic or uniquely determined either. 

If, therefore, a socialist society desires to achieve a similar or even greater rate of real investment—
of course it need not—methods other than saving would have to be resorted
to. Accumulation out of “profits” which could be allowed to materialize
instead of remaining potential only or, as suggested above, something
analogous to credit creation would be quite feasible. It would be much
more natural however to leave the matter to the central board and the
congress or parliament who between them could settle it as part of the
social budget; while the vote on the “automatic” part of the society’s
economic operations would be purely formal or perhaps supervisory in
character, the vote on the investment item—at least on its amount—would
involve a real decision and stand on a par with the vote on army estimates
and so on. Coordination of this decision with the “automatic” decisions
about the quantities and qualities of individual consumers’ goods would
not present any insurmountable difficulties. But in accepting this solution
we should renounce allegiance to the basic principle of our schema in a
very important point.


Other features of our blueprint can be altered even within its general
framework. For example, with a conditional exception as to overtime, I
have not left it to the individual comrades to decide how much work they
are going to do, though as voters and in other ways they may have as
much influence on this decision as they have on the distribution of
incomes and so on. Nor have I allowed them more freedom of choice of
occupation than the central board, within the requirements of its general
plan, may be able and willing to grant them. The arrangement may be
visualized by means of the analogy with compulsory military service.
Such a plan comes fairly close to the slogan: “to everyone according to
his need, everyone to contribute according to his aptitude”—or at all
events it could, with only minor modifications, be made to conform to
it. But instead we may also leave it to the individual comrades to decide
how much and what kind of work they are to do. Rational allocation of
the working force would then have to be attempted by a system of
inducements—premiums again being offered, in this case not only for
overtime but for all work, so as to secure everywhere the “offer” of labor
of all types and grades appropriate to the structure of consumers’ demand
and to the investment program. These premiums would have to bear an
obvious relation to the attractiveness or irksomeness of each job and to
the skill that must be acquired in order to fill it, hence also to the wage
schedule of capitalist society. Though the analogy between the latter and
such a socialist system of premiums should not be pushed too far, we
might speak of a “labor market.” Insertion of this piece of mechanism
would of course make a great deal of difference to our blueprint. But it would not affect the determinateness of the socialist system. Its formal
rationality would in fact stand out still more strongly.
