Marx' theory has 2 propositions:

1. The forms or conditions of production are the fundamental determinant of social structures.
- These structures in turn breed attitudes, actions and civilizations. 

Marx illustrates this as:
- the “hand-mill” that creates feudal societies
- the “steam-mill” that creates capitalist societies

This stresses the technological element but also can be interpreted as mere technology not being all of it. 

<!-- Popularizing a little and recognizing that by doing so we lose much of the meaning, we may say that -->

It is our daily work which forms our minds.

It is our location within the productive process which determines our outlook on things—or the sides of things we see—and the social elbowroom at the command of each of us.*


{{< n n="Supereconics believes in the opposite. It is our mentality as aether spin that causes us to be in a certain role in the economy. A worker mind will naturally become a worker. An executive mind will naturally become an executive." >}}


2. The forms of production themselves have a logic of their own.

They change according to necessities inherent in them so as to produce their successors merely by their own working.

The “hand-mill” system creates an economic and social situation in which the adoption of the mechanical
method of milling becomes a practical necessity that individuals or groups
are powerless to alter. 

The rise of the “steam-mill” in turn creates new social functions and locations, new groups and views, which
develop and interact in such a way as to outgrow their own frame. 

The propeller is responsible for economic and, consequentially, for any other social change.

<!--  a propeller the action
of which does not itself require any impetus external to it. -->


Both propositions are my invaluable working hypotheses.

Most of the current objections completely fail, all those for instance which
in refutation point to the influence of ethical or religious factors, or the one
already raised by Eduard Bernstein, which with delightful simplicity asserts
that “men have heads” and can hence act as they choose. 

Men “choose” their course of action not directly enforced by objective data.

They choose from standpoints, views and propensities that are molded by the objective set.

<!--  do not form another set of
independent data but are themselves  -->

Is the economic interpretation of history more than a convenient approximation which is expected to work less satisfactorily in some cases?

Social structures, types and attitudes are coins that do not readily melt. 

<!-- Once they are formed they persist, possibly for centuries, and since different structures and types display different degrees of this ability to survive, we almost always find that actual group and national behavior more or less departs from what we should expect it to be if we tried to infer it from the dominant forms of the productive process. Though this applies quite generally, it is most clearly seen when a highly durable structure transfers itself bodily from one country to another. -->

The social situation created in Sicily by the Norman conquest shows this.

The feudal type of landlordism in the kingdom of the Franks emerged during the sixth and seventh centuries. 

<!-- This was certainly a most important event that shaped the structure of society for many ages and also influenced conditions of production, wants and technology included. 

But its simplest explanation is to be found in the function of  -->

It came about from the military leadership previously filled by the families who became feudal landlords after the conquest of the new territory.

<!--  This does not fit the Marxian schema at all well and could easily be so construed as to point in a different direction. 

Facts of this nature can no doubt also be brought into the fold by means of auxiliary hypotheses but the necessity of inserting such hypotheses is usually the beginning of the end of a theory.

Many other difficulties that arise in the course of attempts at historical interpretation by means of the Marxian schema could be met by admitting some measure of interaction between the sphere of production and other spheres of social life. 5

But the glamour of fundamental truth that surrounds it depends precisely on the strictness and simplicity of the one-way relation which it asserts. If this be called in question, the economic interpretation of history will have to take its place among other propositions of a similar kind—as one of many partial truths—or else to give way to another that does tell more fundamental truth. However, neither its rank as an achievement nor its handiness as a working hypothesis is impaired thereby.


To the faithful, of course, it is simply the master key to all the secrets of human history. 

metimes feel inclined to smile at rather naïve applications of it, we should remember what sort of arguments it replaced. Even the crippled sister of the economic interpretation of history, the Marxian Theory of Social Classes, moves into a more favorable light as soon as we bear this in mind. -->

Economists have been strangely slow in recognizing social classes.


<!-- 5 In his later life, Engels admitted that freely. Plekhanov went still further in this
direction. -->


<!-- They always classified the agents whose interplay produced the processes they dealt with. But  -->

These classes were simply sets of individuals that displayed some common character.
- Thus, some people were classed as landlords or workmen because they owned land or sold the services of their labor. 

Social classes, however, are not the products of the classifying observer.
- They are 'live' entities that exist as such.

Their existence entails consequences that are entirely missed by a schema which looks upon society as if it were an amorphous assemblage of individuals or families. 

How important is social classes for economic research?

It is very important for:
- many practical applications and 
- all the broader aspects of the social process

The social classes first entered through the Communist Manifesto that said the history of society is the history of class struggles. 

<!-- But even if we tone it down to the proposition that historical events may often be interpreted in terms of class interests and class attitudes and that existing class structures are always an important factor in historical interpretation, enough remains to entitle us to speak of a conception nearly as valuable as was the-economic interpretation of history itself.

Clearly, success on the line of advance opened up by the principle of class struggle depends upon the validity of the particular theory of classes we make our own. 

Our picture of history and all our interpretations of cultural patterns and the mechanism of social change will differ according to whether we choose, for instance,  -->

Gobineau reduces human history to the history of the struggle of races as the racial theory of classes.

The division of labor theory of classes of Schmoller or Durkheim resolve class antagonisms into antagonisms between the vocational groups. 

<!-- Nor is the range of possible differences in analysis confined to the problem of the nature of classes. Whatever view we may hold about it, different interpretations will result from different definitions of class interest 6 and from different opinions about how class action manifests itself. -->

<!-- The subject is a hot-bed of prejudice to this day, and as yet hardly in its
scientific stage. -->

Marx has never worked out systematically what class struggle is.

<!--  it is plain was one of the pivots of his thought. It is
possible that he deferred the task until it was too late, precisely because his
thinking ran so much in terms of class concepts that he did not feel it
necessary to bother about definitive statement at all. 

It is equally possible that some points about it remained unsettled in his own mind, and that his
way toward a full-fledged theory of classes was barred by certain difficulties
he had created for himself by insisting on a purely economic and over-
simplified conception of the phenomenon.  -->

He and his disciples offered applications of this under-developed theory to particular patterns of
which his own History of the Class Struggles in France is the outstanding
example. 7 Beyond that no real progress has been achieved. 

The social theory of Engels was of the division of labor type/
- It was unMarxian in its implications. 

<!-- Barring this we have only the sidelights and
aperçus—some of them of striking force and brilliance—that are strewn all
over the writings of the master, particularly in Das Kapital and the
Communist Manifesto. -->

<!-- 6 The reader will perceive that one’s views about what classes are and about what calls them
into existence do not uniquely determine what the interests of those classes are and how each
class will act on what “it”—its leaders for instance or the rank and file—considers or feels, in
the long run or in the short, erroneously or correctly, to be its interest or interests. The problem
of group interest is full of thorns and pitfalls of its own, quite irrespective of the nature of the
groups under study. -->
