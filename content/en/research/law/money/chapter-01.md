<!-- Money and Trade Considered 
With a Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money
by John Law 
1705

Edinburgh. 
Printed by the Heirs and Successors of Andrew Anderson, Printer to the Queens most Excellent Majesty, 
Anno DOM. 1705. -->

There are several Proposals offer'd to Remedy the Nation's great Scarcity of Money.

<!-- That a right Judgment may be made, which will be most Safe, Advantageous and Practicable; It seems Necessary,  -->

We should look into:
- the Nature of Money and why Silver was used as Money. 
- how far Money affects Trade
- how to preserve and Increase Money

<!-- ; Its Value as a Mettal, its Qualities fitting it for Money, and the Additional Value it received from being us'd as Money. -->

Goods have a Value from the Uses they are applied to.

Their Value is Greater or Lesser, not so much from their more or less valuable, or necessary Uses: As from the greater or lesser Quantity of them in proportion to the Demand for them. 

For example, water is of great use, yet of little Value. This is because the Quantity of Water is much greater than the Demand for it. 

Diamonds are of little use, yet of great Value, because the Demand for Diamonds is much greater, than the Quantity of them.

Goods of the same kind differ in Value, from any difference in their Quality. 

For example, One Horse is better than another Horse. Barley of one Country is better than Barley of another Country.

Goods change their Value, from any Change in their quantity, or in the Demand for them. (Ex.) If Oats be in greater Quantity than last year, and the Demand the same, or lesser, Oats will be less valuable.

John Locke says that The Value of Goods is according to their Quantity in Proportion to their Vent.

The Vent of Goods cannot be greater than the Quantity, but the Demand may be greater.

For example, If the Quantity of Wine brought from France be a 100 Tunn, and the Demand be for 500 Tunn, the Demand is greater than the Vent; and the 100 Tunn will sell at a higher Price, than if the Demand were only equal to the Vent. So the Prices of Goods are not according to the Quantity in Proportion to the Vent, but in Proportion to the Demand.

Before the use of Money was known, Goods were exchanged by Barter, or Contract; and Contracts were made payable in Goods.

This State of Barter was inconvenient, and disadvantageous. 

1. He who desir'd to Barter would not always find People who wanted the Goods he had, and had such Goods as he desir'd in Exchange.

2. Contracts taken payable in Goods were uncertain, for Goods of the same kind differ'd in value.

3. There was no measure by which he Proportion of Value Goods had to one another could be known.

In this State of Barter there was little Trade, and few Arts-men.

The People depended on the Landed-men. The Landed-men labour'd only so much of the Land as serv'd the occasions of their Families, to barter for such necessaries as their Land did not produce; and to lay up for Seed and bad Years. 

What remain'd was unlabour'd; or gifted on condition of Vassalage, and other Services.

The Losses and Difficulties that attended Barter, would force the Landed-men to a greater consumption of the Goods of their own Product, and a lesser Consumption of other Goods; or to supply themselves, they would turn the Land to the product of the several Goods they had occasion for; tho only proper to produce of one kind.

So, much of the Land uas unlabour'd,what was labour'd was not employ'd to that by which it would have turn'd to most Advantage, nor the People to the Labour they were most fit for.

Silver as a Metal had a value in Barter, as other Goods; from the Uses it was then apply'd to.

As Goods of the same kind differ'd in value, so Silver differ'd from Silver, as it was more or less fine.

Silver was lyable to a change in its Value, as other Goods, from any change in its Quantity, or in the Demand for it.

Silver had Qualities which fitted it for the use of Money.

1. It could be brought to a Standard in Fineness, so was certain as to its Quality.

2. It was easie of Delivery.

3. It was of the same value in one Place that it was in another; or differ'd little, being easie of carriage.

4. It could be kept without Loss or Expense; taking up little Room, and being durable.

5. It could be divided without Loss, an Ounce in four Pieces, being equal in Value to an Ounce in one Piece.

Silver having these Qualities, 'its reasonable to think it was used as Money, before it was coin'd. What is mean't by being used as Money, is, that Silver in Bullion was the Measure by which Goods were valued: The Value by which Goods were exchanged: And in which Contracts were made payable.

He who had more Goods than he had use for, would choose to barter them for Silver, tho he had no use for it; Because, Silver was certain in its Quality: It was easie of delivery: It could be kept without Loss or Expense: And with it he could purchase other Goods as he had occasion, in Whole or in Part, at Home or Abroad, silver being divisible without Loss, and of the same Value in different Places. (Ex.) If A.B. had a 100 Sheep, and desired to exchange them for Horses; C.D. had 10 Horses, which were equal to, or worth the 100 sheep, and was willing to exchange: But as A.B. had not present occasion for the Horses, rather than be at the Expense of Keeping them, he would barter his Sheep with E.F. who had the Value to give in Silver, with which he could purchase the Horses at the time he had occasion.

Or if E.F had not Silver, but was satisfied to give his Bond for he Silver, or the Horses, payable at the time A.B. wanted them; A.B. would choose to take the Bond payable in Silver, rather than in Horses: Because Silver was certain in Quality, and Horses differ'd much. So Silver was used as the value in which Contracts were made payable.

Silver was likewise used as the Measure by which Goods were valued, because certain in Quality. (Ex.) If A.B. had a 100 weight of Lead, and desired to exchange it for Barley, the way to know what quantity of Barley was equal in value to the Lead, was by the Silver. If the 100 Weight of Lead was equal to five Ounces of fine Silver, and 5 Ounces of fine Silver equal to 20 Bolls of Barley, then 20 Bolls was the Quantity to be given in exchange for the Lead.

Silver being easie of Carriage, so equal in one Place to what it was in another; was used as the Measure by which Goods to be deliver'd in different places were valued. (Ex.) If a Piece of Wine was to be deliver'd at Glasgow by A.B. Merchant there, to the Order of C.D. Merchant in Aberdeen: And the Value to be deliver'd in Oats at Aberdeen by C.D. to the Order of A.B. The Wine could not be valued by the Quantity of Oats it was worth at Glasgow, nor the Oats by the Quantity of Wine they were worth at Aberdeen. Wine or Oats might differ in Quantity, or be more or less valuable at the one Place than at the other. The way to have known what Quantity of Oats was equal to the Wine, was by the Quantity of Silver each was worth at the places they were to be delivered. If the Piece of Wine was worth at Glasgow 20 Ounces of fine Silver, and 20 Ounces of fine Silver worth 50 Bolls of Oats at Aberdeen; then 50 Bolls was the Quantity of Oats to be given there in return for the Wine.

Silver being capable of a Stamp, Princes, for the greater Convenience of the People, set up Mints to bring it to a Standard, and Stamp it; Whereby its Weight and Fineness was known, without the Trouble of Weighing or Fyning; but the Stamp added nothing to the Value.

For these Reasons Silver was used as Money; Its being Coin'd was only a Consequence of its being applyed to that use in Bullion, tho' not with the same Convenience.

* Mr Lock and others who have Wrot on this Subject, say, The general Consent of Men plac'd an imaginary Value upon silver, because of its Qualities fitting it for Money. [*Lock, pag. 31. upon Interest, and pag. 1, upon Money.]

I cannot conceive how different Nations could agree to put an Imaginary Value upon any thing, expecially upon Silver, by which all other Goods are valued; Or that any one Country would receive that as a Value, which was not valuable equal to what it was given for; Or how that Imaginary Value could have been kept up. But, suppose France receiving Silver at an Imagainary Value, other Nations receiv'd it at that Value, because receiv'd so in France: Then for the same Reason a Crown passing in France for 76 Sols, should pass in Scotland for 76 Pence, and in Holland for 76 Stivers. But on the contrair, even in France where the Crown is rais'd, 'tis worth no more than before when at 60 Sols.

It is reasonable to think Silver was Barter'd as it was valued for its Uses as a Mettal, and was given as Money according to its Value in Barter. The additional Use of Money Silver was apply'd to would add to its Value, because as Money it remedied the Disadvantages and Inconveniences of Barter, and consequently the demand for Silver encreasing, it received an additional Value equal to the greater demand its Use as Money occasioned.

And this additional Value is no more Imaginary, than the Value Silver had in Barter as a Mettal, for such Value was because it serv'd such Uses, and was greater or lesser according to the demand for Silver as a Mettal, proportioned to its Quantity. The additional Value Silver receiv'd from being used as Money, was because of its Qualities which fitted it for that Use; And that Value was according to the additional demand its Use as Money occasioned.

If either of these Values are Imaginary, then all Value is so, for no Goods have any Value, but from the uses they are apply'd to, and according to the Demand for them, in proportion to their Quantity.

Thus Silver having a Value, and Qualities fitting it for Money, which other Goods had not, was made Money, and for the greater convenience of the People was Coin'd.

The Names of the different Pieces might have been Number 1. Number 2. and so on; Number 60 would have the same as a Crown; For the Name and Stamp was only to certify, that the Piece had such a Quantity of Silver in it, of such a fineness.

Goods of any other kind that have the same Qualities might then, and may now be made Money equal to their Value. Gold and Copper may be made Money, but neither with so much Convenience as Silver. Payments in Copper being Inconvient by reason of its Bulk; and Gold not being in so great Quantity as to serve the Use of Money. In Countries where Gold is in great Quantity, it is used as Money; And where gold and silver are scarce, Copper is used.

Gold is coin'd for the more easie Exchange of that Mettal and Copper to serve in small Payments; but Silver is the measure by which Goods are Valued, the Value by which Goods are Exchang'd, and in which Contracts are made payable.

As Money encreas'd, the Disadvantages and Inconveniences of Barter were remov'd; the Poor and Idle were employ'd, more of the Land was Labour'd, the Product encreas'd, Manufactures and Trade improv'd, the Landed-men Lived better, and the People with less Dependance on them.
