II. Example: Electrodynamic effect of closed, circular currents on the potential law
(*).


`Jb`  is the current intensity of the bth circular current

pa is the coordinates of the ponderable masses, whose vis viva we shall neglect.

The function H has the form:
(5) H = −

<!-- 1
2 , ∑∑[ ] Q J J ⋅ ⋅ b c b c
b c
, -->
in which Qb,c
 are functions of pa , and each of the two successive indices b and c refer to
all current circles. The induced electromotive forces, which I would like to denote by Eb
,
are:

<!-- (5a

If a permanent magnet whose position is given by the coordinate p0 is involved then a series of linear terms will be added to H that I would like to denote by h, and which will have the form:

<!-- (5c
) h = ∑[ ] R J⋅
b b
b -->

in which the Rb are functions of the coordinates pa and p0 . 

The calculation of the forces comes about here by the same methods. The total electrodynamic energy is:

<!-- E = H −

J
  ∂

The function h will vanish, since:

<!-- h −

⋅   ∂   ∑ b

 The E = − H that enters into this, like the vis viva on ponderable masses, is a necessarily positive quantity for closed currents (*). 


In addition, E is a homogeneous function of degree two in the Ja
 , and the same considerations can be
applied to it as the ones that were discussed at the end of § 1, in which the determinant of
the quantities

<!-- 2H

 cannot be equal to zero identically.
