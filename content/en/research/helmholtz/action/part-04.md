## § 4. The general characteristics of the forces on moving systems.

The forces that act upon systems at rest from the outside, which satisfy the law of the constancy of energy, exhibit certain legitimate relations with each other that are expressed in the equations:
<!-- P
p
∂
∂
a
b
 =
P
p
∂
∂
b
a -->

and that when these equations are fulfilled, the value of the potential energy can be
found.

One likewise finds that similar relations that are implied immediately by Lagrange’s
expressions for the forces can be presented for moving systems that are subject to the law
of minimum kinetic energy. They are thus not merely to be regarded as functions of the
coordinates pa, as in the systems at rest, but also as functions of the velocities qa
 and the accelerations:

<!-- q′

dq

Equation (1c
): 

(1c) 

<!-- Pa

H d H
p dt q
∂ ∂ 
+   ∂ ∂ a a   -->

immediately yields:

<!-- Pa

2 2 H H H
q q
p q q q q
∂ ∂ ∂    

A. Forces and accelerations.

When represented in this form, the forces are linear functions of the
accelerations. The coefficient of the q′
b
 in the value of the force Pa
 can thus be written:

(9a) 

<!-- P
q
∂
∂ ′
a
b
 =
2H
q q
∂
∂ ∂a b
=
P
q
∂
∂ ′
b
a -->

i.e.: If the acceleration q′
b makes the force Pa
larger by a certain amount then the same
increase in the acceleration q′
a will make the force Pb
 larger by the same amount.

Whether such an influence is present in a given case or not will depend upon whether the
quantities

<!-- 2H
q q
∂
∂ ∂a b -->


are non-zero or equal to zero, respectively. The stated quantities are
zero, for example, for the motions of a completely-free system of ponderable masses
when they are referred to rectangular coordinates. Every individual force component
affects the acceleration only in the direction of the coordinate to which it is refers.
 For the top in example I of § 2, we have:

<!-- A
β
∂
∂ ′′ =
B
α
∂
∂ ′′ = 0,
A
γ
∂
∂ ′′ =
C
α
∂
∂ ′′ = − A ⋅ cos β,
C
β
∂
∂ ′′ =
B
γ
∂
∂ ′′ = 0, -->


in which α″, β″, γ″ denote the accelerations of the angles α, β, γ, resp.

In example II for the electrodynamic effects, one has:

<!-- P
J
∂
∂ ′
a
b
 =
q
∂
∂ ′
b
a
E
 = 0,
J
∂
∂ ′
b
c
E
 =
J
∂
∂ ′
c
b
E -->

The former equation says: Since the ponderomotive force of the circular current does not
depend upon the acceleration of the current, the induced electromotive force can also not
depend upon the acceleration of the current conductor (but possibly upon the velocities,
in both cases). The latter equation says that when for a given position and form of the
circular currents b and c, a rise in the force Eb
 that acts upon b cause an increase in Jc
 by
electromagnetic induction, the same rise in the force Ec
 will produce the same effect on
Jb
.

This reciprocal relationship is not present in example III for the thermodynamic
effects, since the vis viva L of heavy masses does not depend upon the temperature, and
therefore the product ϑ ⋅ qa
 will not enter into the value of (F – L) = H.
