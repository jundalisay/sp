§ 5. Generalization of Hamilton’s differential equation.

Hamilton has taught us how to represent the function Φ that he defined, under somewhat restricting assumptions, to be:


<!-- Φ =
1
0
( )
t
t
F L dt − ⋅ ∫ -->


as a function of time t = t1 – t0 and the values of the coordinates at the time t1 and t0 . We
would like to denote the moments of motion for time t1 by pa
 and sa
 and the ones for time
t0 , by pa
 and sa , resp. It is assumed that the changes in the pa
 during the time interval (t1
– t0) result from the laws of motion. The value of the integral that is denoted by Φ can
then be calculated as a function of the pa
, pa
, and t, and for this kind of representation, we
will have:

This entire conversion can also be performed under the extended assumptions that were
made in § 1 (*). For the present purposes, it will suffice to do this under that assumption

 (* ) 

C. G. J. Jacobi has already remarked that Pa
 = 0. Moreover, the function H might be an arbitrary function of the pa
 and qa , as long as it fulfills the continuity condition that were discussed above.


The first two systems of equations (10) are obtained by carrying out the
partial integrations that convert the variation of Φ by the δqa
 into a variation by δpa . 

The
differential quotient with respect to time ∂Φ / ∂t that enters into the third of equations
(10) will be obtained for unvaried values of the pa
 and pa
 when we look for the change in
the value of Φ that occurs as a result of an actual motion for a lengthening of the time by
dt. Thus, pa
 will increase by qa
⋅ dt, and on the other hand, equation (1a
) shows that the
stated variation of Φ equals the final value of H ⋅ dt. Thus:
H ⋅ dt = q
t p
    ∂Φ ∂Φ     + ⋅     ∂ ∂     ∑ a

⋅ dt,
or, from the first equations (10) and (4):
t
∂Φ
∂
 = E.
 The following relations between the quantities sa , sa , E now result from equations
(10) when those quantities are represented as functions of the pa , pa , and t:

When these conditions are fulfilled: 

(10d) E ⋅ dt − ∑ ∑ [ ] [ ] s dp d ⋅ + ⋅ a a a a
a a
s p = dΦ
will be the complete differential of a function of the pa , pa , and t.
 Moreover, if the quantities E, sa , and sa
 that enter into the differential equation (10d
)
are to correspond to the energy and moment of motion for a possible motion of the  system that is not acted upon by external forces then they will not be completely
independent of each other. In fact, as Hamilton has shown already, the equations of
motion of the system can be represented by the system of equations:
(10e) sa
 = const.
 
Since the sa
 are functions of the pa , of t, and of the pa , in general, the pa will become
functions of time from this, and the pa
 and sa , which represent integration constants, can
be determined, so the position of the system will be given for later instants. Now, if one
substitutes the value of pa
 that is thus obtained in the value of E for a conservative system
then it would be converted into a function of the pa
 and sa that cannot, however, be
dependent upon time for any longer. If we revert to equations (10) then this will say that:
(10f
)
t
∂Φ
∂
 = E ,
  ∂Φ   ∂   a
a
p
p
,
or that a first-order differential equation must exist between the differential quotients ∂Φ
/ ∂t and ∂Φ / ∂pa of the function Φ whose coefficients depend upon only the pa
.
 However, we can likewise traverse the path of a system backwards from a certain
final position, in which we will have to treat the values of the pa
 and sa
 as if they were
constant. The equations:
sa
 = const.
will then yield the quantities pa
 as functions of t and the fixed values of sa
 and pa
 . When
these values of the pa
 are substituted into the function E, it will prove to be a function of
the sa
 and pa
, from which, t must be absent. It follows from this that there must be a
second differential equation for the function Φ:
(10g)

<!-- t
∂Φ
∂
 = G p ,
p
  ∂Φ   ∂   a
a -->

between the differential quotients ∂Φ / ∂t and ∂Φ / ∂pa whose coefficients depend upon
only the pa .

Hamilton gave a specific form to these two differential equations for the function Φ,
since he considered the two components components of the electrokinetic potential to be
given, and indeed in the older, more restricted, form, while here we seek only the most
general character of those equations that simultaneously corresponds to the principle of
the conservation of energy and that of least action.

This also comes down to saying that any pair of associated sa
 and sa
 should be values
of the same function at the beginning and the end of the time interval t. If we apply the differential equation (10d
) to very small time intervals t then for actual motions, the
quantities will have to be set to:

(10h) pa
 – pa
 = qa
⋅ t,
and these qa
 will approach the values of the velocity all the more closely as t becomes
smaller. Likewise, however, the difference (sa
 – sa
) must also approach zero with
decreasing t. 

If the differential equation (10d) and these auxiliary conditions are fulfilled
then the variational problem will also be fulfilled.
 To that end, one needs only to hold the pa
 constant, and vary the pa
 in the way that
they would change when one varies the time interval dt for an unperturbed traversal of
the motion; thus:
 dpa
 = 0 and dpa
 = qa
⋅ dt.
From (10d
), this will imply that:

<!--  dΦ = {E – ∑ [sa
⋅ qa
]} ⋅ dt,
or
(10i
) Φ =
0
{ [ ]}
t
∫
dt E s q ⋅ − ⋅ ∑ a a -->

in which, one must take E, sa , and qa under the integral sign to have the actual values that
they have at time t, which is the start of the corresponding motion. That is the previous
representation of the function Φ, and the differential equation (10d
) implies that this value of Φ must satisfy the minimum condition for the actual path of the system that is
retraced. Namely, when we think of the path of the system from the position that is
denoted by 0 to the one that is denoted by 2 as being divided by an intermediate, variable
position, which we will denote by 1, then from (10i
):

Φ0, 2 = Φ0, 1 + Φ1, 2 .

If we now vary the coordinates of the intermediate position then, from (10d), we will
have:
δΦ0, 2 = − δΦ1, 2 = −∑[ ] s p ⋅δ a a
a
,
and as a result:
δΦ0, 2 = 0.
As is easily seen, this can be carried over to an arbitrary subdivision of the path into
arbitrarily many pieces, and that will imply that the integral Φ0, 2 will not vary when
makes any sort of small changes to the intermediate positions.
 The minimal theorem depends upon the fulfillment of the differential equation (10d
),
and for the extended form of H, as well as for the original, more restricted form that
Lagrange and Hamilton started with.

 The conditions that exist between the quantities that enter into the differential (10d
)
that were discussed in this paragraph reduce to one equation that gives E as a function of
the pa
 and sa
 when one employs C. G. J. Jacobi’s (
*
) conversion.
