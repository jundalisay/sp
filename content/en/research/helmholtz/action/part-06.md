§ 6. Reciprocity for the forward and reverse motions

I call the motion of a system reversible when the sequence of positions that it passed
through during its forward motion can also be traversed by the reverse motion without the
action of other forces, and with the same intermediate times for each pair of equal
positions. The reverse motion will be possible when the values of the kinetic potential is
not changed when one changes the signs of all qa
 . However, if products and powers of
the qa
 of odd degree occur, which happen, e.g., for the interference of hidden motions (§
1), then the motion will be reversible only when it is mechanically possible to also make
some of the constants (viz., the velocities of the hidden motions) negative in such a way
that the quantity H does not change in value under a simultaneous setting to negative
values of these constants and all qa
 . This is easily obtained from a consideration of the
equations of motion (1c
) when one considers that dt must also assume the opposite sign
under reversal.
Law of reciprocity.
 In my acoustic investigations (**), I proved a law of reciprocity that I easily extended
to small oscillations around a stable equilibrium position of an arbitrary, oscillating,
mechanical system in my lectures. However, it is more general, and true for any moving
system that is subject to the law of least action and has a reversible motion.
The original motion A will be unchanged when one keeps all initial positions at time
t0 unchanged, but increases one of the moments of motion s1 by ds1. In that way, the
coordinate p2 must increase by dp2 at time t. If one then changes the moment of motion s2
in the reversed motion when it goes through the value pa of the coordinates by the same
amount that one changed s1 then the coordinate p1 will be changed by just as much as p2
after the time interval t = t1 – t0 .
 Since all dt and dpa
 must be zero, we will have:

Of these, only ds1 should be non-zero. For the sake of brevity in our notation, we would
like to write:

<!-- (11a

 =

 From (10b
), the quantities σa, b
 are the same as the σb, a
 . We denote the determinant
of the quantities σa, b
 by D(σ) . If these are not identically zero then, from equations (11),
with the restriction that was made, we will have:
(11b) dp2 =
( )
1,2
log D σ

⋅ ds1 .
 By contrast, if we demand that all dpa
 = 0, and likewise all dsa
 = 0, with the exception
of ds2 , then we will get, with consideration given to (11a
), the corresponding equation:
 dp1 =
( )
1,2

for the forward motion. For the reverse motion, the signs of the moments of motion are
inverted, and thus, those of the σa, b
 , as well; thus, one will have:

<!-- (11c
) dp1 =
( )
1,2
log D σ

for them. 

It follows from the combination of equations (11b
) and (11c) that:

dp2 : ds1 = dp1 : ds2 ,

with which, the theorem that was expressed above will be proved.

As far as the exceptional case is concerned, in which the determinant D(σ) is equal to zero identically, in that case, the dpb
 would not necessarily be equal to zero when all dsa
are also equal to zero, without exception. Now, since the motion of the system must be
determined completely, and therefore, the values of the pa
 would not be double-valued
during the course of time t if the initial positions pa
 and the initial velocities were given at
the start of the time interval t, this exceptional case could occur only if the qa
 were not
determined completely by the values of the sa
, which we excluded in the concluding
remarks of § 1. It is therefore unnecessary to pay any attention to that exceptional case.
 The sudden changes in the values of the sa
 and the sa
 here, under which, the
coordinates themselves should suffer no changes in their values, would come about
mechanically in such a way that one lets forces Pa
 act during a very small time interval,

but with corresponding intensity. In that way, the various rising degrees of velocities can
be traversed without also having to change the position of the time at which the greatest
velocity is attained notably. For such an assumption, it follows from equation (1) that:
− ∫ Pa
⋅ dt = s1 – s0 .


Since Pa
 denoted the force that was exerted upon the moving system from the outside, in
the notation that was used there, (− Pa
) will be the opposite external force that is required
in order to bring about the desired change in motion.
 Following Sir W. Thomson, we would like to refer to such a force effect as a push in
the direction of the coordinate pa
 . In that regard, one must remark that, in general, the
forces Pa
 are aggregates of components that act upon different parts of the system, and
are distributed in such a way that the aggregate of forces Pa
 performs no work under any
variation of the remaining coordinates, except for pa
. Moreover, since we have to
distinguish between forward and reverse motion, it would be preferable to consider
values of the dsa
 that increase the forward moment sa , as well as displacements dpa
 that
increase the distance (pa
 – pa
), to be positive for the forward motion, while for the reverse
motion, values of the dsa
 that increase the reverse moment (− sa
) and displacements (−
dpa
) that increase the distance (pa
 – pa
) are considered to be negative, and to treat them as
equivalent to the positive changes in dsa
 and dpa
 for the forward motion.
 The reciprocity theorem can then be expressed as:
If a push that increases only the moment sa
 by dsa
 at the initial position of the forward
motion has increased the coordinate of the final position pb by dpb after the time interval t
then an equivalent reverse push that increases the reverse moment (− sb
) by the same
amount at the earlier final position would provoke the equivalent reverse change in the
coordinate pa  after time t.
