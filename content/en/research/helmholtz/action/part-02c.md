III. Example. Thermodynamics. 

For a suitable choice of coordinates, the laws of reversible thermal processes can be represented in the form (**):

<!-- (6)

) E = F – ϑ ⋅

 + L. -->

In this, F is what I called the “free energy,” which is a function of the coordinates pa and
the absolute temperature ϑ, and L is the vis viva of the visible motions of the heavy
masses, and thus a function of the pa
 and the qa  that is homogeneous of degree two in the
latter and independent of ϑ. 

dQ is the amount of heat that enters the body in the element
of time dt – i.e., the work that is done by the environment – and only forces that bring
about the motion of heat will be exerted.

We will get this form, with different variables, when we set:
<!-- ϑ
∂
∂
F
 = − S, -->
then let s denote a function of S, and further set:

The vis viva of the visible motions L is added in order to insure the completeness that is desirable here.

If we now express H and s as functions of the pa and η then the equations above can be
written [loc. cit., Abh. I, eq. (1d)]:
(6c) 

<!-- dQ

These equations, like the first ones (6), (6a
), have entirely the same form (cf., loc. cit., §
3) as the ones for the motion of a monocyclic system whose kinetic potential is (H – L),
and for which η denotes the velocity and s, the moment of motion of the monocyclic
motion.

If we let P(η) denote the force that is exerted in the direction of the velocity η then we will have:
(6f) P(η) ⋅ η ⋅ dt = − dQ.

The analogy with the Lagrange expressions thus remains true here, as well, and in
that way that entropy S of the motion might depend upon the moment of motion s of the
monocyclic motion. In this case, this possibility of the coupling of equally-warm systems
of bodies to a larger system, and the kinetic theory of gases lead one to assume that:

<!-- ϑ = s ⋅ q,
 S = −
ϑ
∂
∂
F
 = C ⋅ log s. -->

Thus, for any given system of bodies, the temperature would be set to be proportional to
the vis viva of the heat motion, as Clausius and Boltzmann apparently already sought to
before me (*). 

The later applications of our example are independent of the question of the relationship between the functions S and s.

<!-- (*) In a communication to the Berlin Academy (Sitzungsberichte 8 December 1884), I have expressed
this theorem more definitively, but then I recognized that a step in the proof could not be justified without
demanding a further restricting condition whose physical meaning I still do not know how to interpret,
although I hope this will come to pass. I must therefore accept that the objection that L. Boltzmann made
against that paper (Wiener Sitzungsberichte (2), Abh. XCII, Bd. 8 October 1885) is justified in that regard.  -->


The motion of heat can apparently be regarded as an especially far-reaching example of the elimination of the coordinates pc , and for that reason H can be a complicated
function of ϑ or η. 

However, my investigations into the combined monocyclic systems
have shown that many combined forms of motions that are already quite similar to the
internal molecular motions of warm bodies can also lead to the same laws.
