## The Speculative Thinker 
 
24. To join together diverse peaks of thought, and not complete one road that has no turn.

<!-- An Aphorism. -->

25. What must be said, may well be said twice over.


## The Law of the Elements

26. In turn they conquer as the cycles roll, and wane the one to other still, and wax/

The one to other in turn by olden Fate;

For these are all, and, as they course along

Through one another, they become both men and multitudinous tribes of hairy beasts.

In fair order, Love united all, while ripped asunder by the hate of Strife

Till they, when grown into the One and All
Once more, once more go under and succumb.

And in so far as is the One still wont to grow from the Many, and the Many, again,
Spring from primeval scattering of the One,
So far have they a birth and mortal date.

This long interchange does not end. 

Ends not, so far forever established gods
Around the circle of the world they move.


## The Sphere

27. There views one not the swift limbs of the Sun,
Nor there the strength of shaggy Earth, nor Sea;
But in the strong recess of Harmony,
Established firm abides the rounded Sphere,
Exultant in surrounding solitude.

27a. Nor faction nor fight unseemly in its limbs.

28. The Sphere on every side the boundless same,
Exultant in surrounding solitude.

29. For from its back there swing no branching arms,
It hath no feet nor knees alert, nor form
Of life-producing member,—on all sides
A sphere it was, and like unto itself.

30. Yet after mighty Strife had waxen great
Within the members of the Sphere, and rose
To her own honors, as the times arrived
Which unto each in turn, to Strife, to Love,
Should come by amplest oath and old decree. . .

31. For one by one did quake the limbs of God.


## Physical Analogies

32. δύω δέει ἄρθρον.
The joint binds two.

33. But as when rennet of the fig-tree juice
Curdles the white milk, and will bind it fast. . .

34. Cementing meal with water. . .


## The Conquest of Love

35. But hurrying back, I now will make return

To paths of festal song, laid down before,

Draining each flowing thought from flowing thought.

When down the Vortex to the last abyss

Had foundered Hate, and Lovingness had reached

The eddying center of the Mass, behold

Around her into Oneness gathered all.

Yet not a-sudden, but only as willingly

Each from its several region joined with each;

And from their mingling thence are poured abroad

The multitudinous tribes of mortal things.

Yet much unmixed among the mixed remained,

As much as Hate still held in scales aloft.

For not all blameless did Hate yield and stand

Out yonder on the circle's utmost bounds;

But partwise yet within he stayed, partwise

Was he already from the members gone.

And ever the more skulked away and fled,

Then ever the more, and nearer, inward pressed

The gentle minded, the divine Desire

Of blameless Lovingness. Thence grew apace

Those mortal Things, erstwhile long wont to be

Immortal, and the erstwhile pure and sheer

Were mixed, exchanging highways of new life,

And from their mingling thence are poured abroad

The multitudinous tribes of mortal things,

Knit in all forms and wonderful to see.

36. As they came together, Hate began

To take his stand far on the outer verge.

Similia similibus.

37. Earth through Earth her figure magnifies,

Air through Air.
