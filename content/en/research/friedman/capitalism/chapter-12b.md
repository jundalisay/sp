2. Minimum wage laws 

Minimum wage laws are about as clear a case as
one can find of a measure the effects of which are precisely the opposite of
those intended by the men of good will who support it. Many proponents of
minimum wage laws quite properly deplore extremely low rates; they regard
them as a sign of poverty; and they hope, by outlawing wage rates below some
specified level, to reduce poverty. In fact, insofar as minimum wage laws have
any effect at all, their effect is clearly to increase poverty. The state can legislate
a minimum wage rate. It can hardly require employers to hire at that minimum
all who were formerly employed at wages below the minimum. It is clearly not in
the interest of employers to do so. The effect of the minimum wage is therefore
to make unemployment higher than it otherwise would be. Insofar as the low
wage rates are in fact a sign of poverty, the people who are rendered
unemployed are precisely those who can least afford to give up the income they
had been receiving, small as it may appear to the people voting for the minimum
wage.

 This case is in one respect very much like public housing. In both, the
people who are helped are visible the people whose wages are raised; the
people who occupy the publicly built units. The people who are hurt are
anonymous and their problem is not clearly connected to its cause: the people
who join the ranks of the unemployed or, more likely, are never employed in
particular activities because of the existence of the minimum wage and are
driven to even less remunerative activities or to the relief rolls; the people who
are pressed ever closer together in the spreading slums that seem to be rather a
sign of the need for more public housing than a consequence of the existing
public housing.
 

A large part of the support for minimum wage laws comes not from
disinterested men of good will but from interested parties. For example, northern
trade unions and northern firms threatened by southern competition favor
minimum wage laws to reduce the competition from the South.

3. Farm price supports Farm price supports are another example. Insofar
as they can be justified at all on grounds other than the political fact that rural
areas are over-represented in the electoral college and Congress, it must be on
the belief that farmers on the average have low incomes. Even if this be
accepted as a fact, farm price supports do not accomplish the intended purpose
of helping the farmers who need help. In the first place, benefits arc, if anything,
inverse to need, since they are in proportion to the amount sold on the market.

The impecunious farmer not only sells less on the market than the wealthier
farmer; in addition, he gets a larger fraction of his income from products grown
for his own use, and these do not qualify for the benefits. In the second place,
the benefits, if any, to farmers from the price-support program are much smaller
than the total amount spent. This is clearly true of the amount spent for storage
and similar costs which does not go to the farmer at all indeed the suppliers of
storage capacity and facilities may well be the major beneficiaries. It is equally
true of the amount spent to purchase agricultural products. The farmer is
thereby induced to spend additional sums on fertilizer, seed, machinery, etc. At
most, only the excess adds to his income. And finally, even this residual of a
residual overstates the gain since the effect of the program has been to keep
more people on the farm than would otherwise have stayed there. Only the
excess, if any, of what they can earn on the farm with the price-support program
over what they can earn off the farm, is a net benefit to them. The main effect
of the purchase program has simply been to make farm output larger, not to
raise the income per farmer.

Some of the costs of the farm purchase program are so obvious and wellknown as to need little more than mention: the consumer has paid twice, once in taxes for farm benefit payments, again by paying a higher price for food; the
farmer has been saddled with onerous restrictions and detailed centralized
control; the nation has been saddled with a spreading bureaucracy. There is,
however, one set of costs which is less well known. The farm program has been
a major hindrance in the pursuit of foreign policy. In order to maintain a higher
domestic than world price, it has been necessary to impose quotas on imports
for many items. Erratic changes in our policy have had serious adverse effects on
other countries. A high price for cotton encouraged other countries to enlarge
their cotton production. When our high price led to an unwieldy stock of cotton,
we proceeded to sell overseas at low prices and imposed heavy losses on the
producers whom we had by our earlier actions encouraged to expand output.
The list of similar cases could be multiplied.

Old Age and Survivor's Insurance

 The "social security" program is one of those things on which the tyranny
of the status quo is beginning to work its magic. Despite the controversy that
surrounded its inception, it has come to be so much taken for granted that its
desirability is hardly questioned any longer. Yet it involves a large-scale invasion
into the personal lives of a large fraction of the nation without, so far as I can
see, any justification that is at all persuasive, not only on liberal principles, but
on almost any other. I propose to examine the biggest phase of it, that which
involves payments to the aged.

 As an operational matter, the program known as old age and survivor's
insurance (OASI) consists of a special tax imposed on payrolls, plus payments to
persons who have reached a specified age, of amounts determined by the age at
which payments begin, family status, and prior earning record.

 As an analytical matter, OASI consists of three separable elements:

 1. The requirement that a wide class of persons must purchase specified
annuities, i.e., compulsory provision for old age.

 2. The requirement that the annuity must be purchased from the
government; i.e., nationalization of the provision of these annuities.

 3. A scheme for redistributing income, insofar as the value of the
annuities to which people are entitled when they enter the system is not equal to
the taxes they will pay.

 Clearly, there is no necessity for these elements to be combined. Each
individual could be required to pay for his own annuity; the individual could be
permitted to purchase an annuity from private firms; yet individuals could be
required to purchase specified annuities. The government could go into the
business of selling annuities without compelling individuals to buy specified
annuities and require the business to be self-supporting. And clearly the
government can and does engage in redistribution without using the device of
annuities.

 Let us therefore consider each of these elements in turn to see how far, if
at all, each can be justified. It will facilitate our analysis, I believe, if we consider
them in reverse order.

 1. Income redistribution. The present OASI program involves two major
kinds of redistribution; from some OASI beneficiaries to others; from the general
taxpayer to OASI beneficiaries. 
151

 The first kind of redistribution is primarily from those who entered the
system relatively young, to those who entered it at an advanced age. The latter
are receiving, and will for some time be receiving, a greater amount as benefits
than the taxes they paid could have purchased. Under present tax and benefit
schedules, on the other hand, those who entered the system at a young age will
receive decidedly less.

 I do not see any grounds liberal or other on which this particular
redistribution can be defended. The subsidy to the beneficiaries is independent
of their poverty or wealth; the man of means receives it as much as the indigent.
The tax which pays the subsidy is a flat-rate tax on earnings up to a maximum.

It constitutes a larger fraction of low incomes than of high. What conceivable
justification is there for taxing the young to subsidize the old regardless of the
economic status of the old; for imposing a higher rate of tax for this purpose on
the low incomes than on the high; or, for that matter, for raising the revenues to
pay the subsidy by a tax on payrolls?

 The second kind of redistribution arises because the system is not likely to
be fully self-financing. During the period when many were covered and paying
taxes, and few had qualified for benefits, the system appeared to be selffinancing and indeed to be having a surplus. But this appearance depends on
neglecting the obligation being accumulated with respect to the persons paying
the tax. 

The taxes paid have sufficed to finance the
accumulated obligation. Many experts assert that even on a cash basis, a subsidy
will be required. And such a subsidy generally has been required in similar
systems in other countries. This is a highly technical matter which we cannot and
need not go into here and about which there can be honest differences of
opinion.

 For our purpose, it is enough to ask only the hypothetical question
whether a subsidy from the general taxpayer could be justified if it is required. I
see no grounds on which such a subsidy can be justified. We may wish to help
poor people. Is there any justification for helping people whether they are poor
or not because they happen to be a certain age? Is this not an entirely arbitrary
redistribution?

 The only argument I have ever come across to justify the redistribution
involved in OASI is one that I regard as thoroughly immoral despite its wide use.
This argument is that OASI redistribution on the average helps low-income
people more than high-income people despite a large arbitrary element; that it
would be better to do this redistribution more efficiently; but that the community
will not vote for the redistribution directly though it will vote for it as part of a
social security package. In essence, what this argument says is that the 
152
community can be fooled into voting for a measure that it opposes by presenting
the measure in a false guise. Needless to say, the people who argue this way are
the loudest in their condemnation of "misleading" commercial advertising!1


2. Nationalization of the provision of required annuities Suppose we avoid
redistribution by requiring each person to pay for the annuity he gets, in the
sense of course, that the premium suffices to cover the present value of the
annuity, account being taken both of mortality and interest returns. 

What justification is there then for requiring him to purchase it from a governmental concern? If redistribution is to be accomplished, clearly the taxing power of the government must be used. But if redistribution is to be no part of the program and, as we have just seen, it is hard to see any justification for making it part, why not permit individuals who wish to do so to purchase their annuities from private concerns? A close analogy is provided by state laws requiring compulsory purchase of automobile liability insurance. So far as I know, no state which has such a law even has a state insurance company, let alone compels automobile owners to buy their insurance from a government agency.

 Possible economies of scale are no argument for nationalizing the
provision of annuities. If they are present, and the government sets up a concern
to sell annuity contracts, it may be able to undersell competitors by virtue of its
size. In that case, it will get the business without compulsion. If it cannot
undersell them, then presumably economics of scale are not present or are not
sufficient to overcome other diseconomies of governmental operation.

 One possible advantage of nationalizing the provision of annuities is to
facilitate the enforcement of compulsory purchase of annuities. However, this
seems a rather trivial advantage. It would be easy to devise alternative
administrative arrangements, such as requiring individuals to include a copy of a
receipt for premium payments along with their income tax returns; or having
their employers certify to their having met the requirement. The administrative
problem would surely be minor compared with that imposed by the present
arrangements.

 The costs of nationalization seem clearly to outweigh any such trivial
advantage. Here, as elsewhere, individual freedom to choose, and competition of
private enterprises for custom, would promote improvements in the kinds of
contracts available, and foster variety and diversity to meet individual need. On
the political level, there is the obvious gain from avoiding an expansion in the
scale of governmental activity and the indirect threat to freedom of every such
expansion.

 Some less obvious political costs arise from the character of the present
program. The issues involved become very technical and complex. The layman is 
153
often incompetent to judge them. Nationalization means that the bulk of the
"experts" become employees of the nationalized system, or university people
closely linked with it. Inevitably, they come to favor its expansion, not, I hasten
to add, out of narrow self-interest but because they are operating within a
framework in which they take for granted governmental administration and are
familiar only with its techniques. The only saving grace in the United States so
far has been the existence of private insurance companies involved in similar
activities.

 Effective control by Congress over the operations of such agencies as the
Social Security Administration becomes essentially impossible as a result of the
technical character of their task and their near-monopoly of experts. They
become self-governing bodies whose proposals are in the main rubber-stamped
by Congress. The able and ambitious men who make their careers in them are
naturally anxious to expand the scope of their agencies and it is exceedingly
difficult to prevent them from doing so. If the expert says yea, who is there
competent to say nay? So we have seen an increasing fraction of the population
drawn into the social security system, and now that there remain few possibilities
of expansion in that direction, we are seeing a move toward the addition of new
programs, such as medical care.

 I conclude that the case against the nationalization of the provision of
annuities is exceedingly strong, not only in terms of liberal principles but even in
terms of the values expressed by proponents of the welfare state. If they believe
that the government can provide the service better than the market, they should
favor a government concern to issue annuities in open competition with other
concerns. If they are right, the government concern will prosper. If they are
wrong, the welfare of the people will be advanced by having a private
alternative. Only the doctrinaire socialist, or the believer in centralized control for
its own sake, can, so far as I can see, take a stand on principle in favor of
nationalization of the provision of annuities.

 3. Compulsory Purchase of Annuities Having cleared away the underbrush,
we are now ready to face the key issue: compelling individuals to use some of
their current income to purchase annuities to provide for their old age.

 One possible justification for such compulsion is strictly paternalistic.
People could if they wished decide to do individually what the law requires them
to do as a group. But they are separately short-sighted and improvident. "We"
know better than "they" that it is in their own good to provide for their old age to
a greater extent than they would voluntarily; we cannot persuade them
individually; but we can persuade 51 per cent or more to compel all to do what is
in their own good. This paternalism is for responsible people, hence docs not
even have the excuse of concern for children or madmen. 
154

 This position is internally consistent and logical. A thoroughgoing
paternalist who holds it cannot be dissuaded by being shown that he is making a
mistake in logic. He is our opponent on grounds of principle, not simply a wellmeaning but misguided friend. Basically, he believes in dictatorship, benevolent
and maybe majoritarian, but dictatorship none the less.

Those of us who believe in freedom must believe also in the freedom of
individuals to make their own mistakes. If a man knowingly prefers to live for
today, to use his resources for current enjoyment, deliberately choosing a
penurious old age, by what right do we prevent him from doing so? We may
argue with him, seek to persuade him that he is wrong, but are we entitled to
use coercion to prevent him from doing what he chooses to do? Is there not
always the possibility that he is right and that we are wrong? Humility is the
distinguishing virtue of the believer in freedom; arrogance, of the paternalist.

 Few people are thoroughgoing paternalists. It is a position that is most
unattractive if examined in the cold light of the day. Yet the paternalistic
argument has played so large a role in measures like social security that it seems
worth making it explicit.

 A possible justification on liberal principles for compulsory purchase of
annuities is that the improvident will not suffer the consequence of their own
action but will impose costs on others. We shall not, it is said, be willing to see
the indigent aged suffer in dire poverty. We shall assist them by private and
public charity. Hence the man who does not provide for his old age will become
a public charge. Compelling him to buy an annuity is justified not for his own
good but for the good of the rest of us.

 The weight of this argument clearly depends on fact. If 90 per cent of the
population would become charges on the public at age 65 in the absence of
compulsory purchase of annuities, the argument would have great weight. If
only 1 per cent would, the argument has none. Why restrict the freedom of 99
per cent to avoid the costs that the other 1 per cent would impose on the
community?

 The belief that a large fraction of the community would become public
charges if not compelled to purchase annuities owed its plausibility, at the time
OASI was enacted, to the Great Depression. In every year from 1931 through
1940, more than one-seventh of the labor force was unemployed. And
unemployment was proportionately heavier among the older workers. This
experience was unprecedented and has not been repeated since. It did not arise
because people were improvident and failed to provide for their old age. It was a
consequence, as we have seen, of government mismanagement. OASI is a cure, if cure it be at all, for a very different malady and one of which we have had no
experience.

 The unemployed of the 1930's certainly created a serious problem of the
relief of distress, of many people becoming public charges. But old-age was by
no means the most serious problem. Many people in productive ages were on
the relief or assistance rolls. And the steady spread of OASI, until today more
than sixteen million persons receive benefits, has not prevented a continued
growth in the number receiving public assistance.

 Private arrangements for the care of the aged have altered greatly over
time. Children were at one time the major means whereby people provided for
their own old age. As the community became more affluent, the mores changed.
The responsibilities imposed on children to care for their parents declined and
more and more people came to make provision for old age in the form of
accumulating property or acquiring private pension rights. More recently, the
development of pension plans over and above OASI has accelerated. Indeed,
some students believe that a continuation of present trends points to a society in
which a large fraction of the public scrimps in their productive years to provide
themselves with a higher standard of life in old age than they ever enjoyed in
the prime of life. Some of us may think such a trend perverse, but if it reflects
the tastes of the community, so be it.

 Compulsory purchase of annuities has therefore imposed large costs for
little gain. It has deprived all of us of control over a sizable fraction of our
income, requiring us to devote it to a particular purpose, purchase of a
retirement annuity, in a particular way, by buying it from a government concern.
It has inhibited competition in the sale of annuities and the development of
retirement arrangements. It has given birth to a large bureaucracy that shows
tendencies of growing by what it feeds on, of extending its scope from one area
of our life to another. And all this, to avoid the danger that a few people might
become charges on the public. 

Another current example of the same argument is in connection with proposals
for federal subsidies for schooling (mislcadingly labeled, "aid to education"). A
case can be made for using federal funds to supplement schooling expenditures
in the states with the lowest incomes, on the grounds that the children schooled
may migrate to other states. There is no case whatsoever for imposing taxes on
all the states and giving federal subsidies to all the states. Yet every bill
introduced into Congress provides for the latter and not the former. Some
proponents of these bills, who recognize that only subsidies to some states can
be justified, defend their position by saying that a bill providing only for such
subsidies could not be passed and that the only way to get disproportionate
subsidies to poorer states is to include them in a bill providing subsidies to all
states.
