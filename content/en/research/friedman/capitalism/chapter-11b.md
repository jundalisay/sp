2. Minimum wage laws Minimum wage laws are about as clear a case as one can find of a measure the effects of which are precisely the opposite of those intended by the men of good will who support it. Many proponents of minimum wage laws quite properly deplore extremely low rates; they regard them as a sign of poverty; and they hope, by outlawing wage rates below some specified level, to reduce poverty.

In fact, insofar as minimum wage laws have any effect at all, their effect is clearly to increase poverty. The state can legislate a minimum wage rate. It can hardly require employers to hire at that minimum all who were formerly employed at wages below the minimum. It is clearly not in the interest of employers to do so. The effect of the minimum wage is therefore to make unemployment higher than it otherwise would be. Insofar as the low wage rates are in fact a sign of poverty, the people who are rendered unemployed are precisely those who can least afford to give up the income they had been receiving, small as it may appear to the people voting for the minimum wage.

This case is in one respect very much like public housing. In both, the people who are helped are visible the people whose wages are raised; the people who occupy the publicly built units. The people who are hurt are anonymous and their problem is not clearly connected to its cause: the people who join the ranks of the unemployed or, more likely, are never employed in particular activities because of the existence of the minimum wage and are driven to even less remunerative activities or to the relief rolls; the people who are pressed ever closer together in the spreading slums that seem to be rather a sign of the need for more public housing than a consequence of the existing public housing.
 

A large part of the support for minimum wage laws comes not from
disinterested men of good will but from interested parties. For example, northern
trade unions and northern firms threatened by southern competition favor
minimum wage laws to reduce the competition from the South.

3. Farm price supports Farm price supports are another example. Insofar
as they can be justified at all on grounds other than the political fact that rural
areas are over-represented in the electoral college and Congress, it must be on
the belief that farmers on the average have low incomes. Even if this be
accepted as a fact, farm price supports do not accomplish the intended purpose
of helping the farmers who need help. In the first place, benefits arc, if anything,
inverse to need, since they are in proportion to the amount sold on the market.

The impecunious farmer not only sells less on the market than the wealthier
farmer; in addition, he gets a larger fraction of his income from products grown
for his own use, and these do not qualify for the benefits. In the second place,
the benefits, if any, to farmers from the price-support program are much smaller
than the total amount spent. This is clearly true of the amount spent for storage
and similar costs which does not go to the farmer at all indeed the suppliers of
storage capacity and facilities may well be the major beneficiaries. It is equally
true of the amount spent to purchase agricultural products. The farmer is
thereby induced to spend additional sums on fertilizer, seed, machinery, etc. At
most, only the excess adds to his income. And finally, even this residual of a
residual overstates the gain since the effect of the program has been to keep
more people on the farm than would otherwise have stayed there. Only the
excess, if any, of what they can earn on the farm with the price-support program
over what they can earn off the farm, is a net benefit to them. The main effect
of the purchase program has simply been to make farm output larger, not to
raise the income per farmer.

Some of the costs of the farm purchase program are so obvious and wellknown as to need little more than mention: the consumer has paid twice, once in taxes for farm benefit payments, again by paying a higher price for food; the
farmer has been saddled with onerous restrictions and detailed centralized
control; the nation has been saddled with a spreading bureaucracy. There is,
however, one set of costs which is less well known. The farm program has been
a major hindrance in the pursuit of foreign policy. In order to maintain a higher
domestic than world price, it has been necessary to impose quotas on imports
for many items. Erratic changes in our policy have had serious adverse effects on
other countries. A high price for cotton encouraged other countries to enlarge
their cotton production. When our high price led to an unwieldy stock of cotton,
we proceeded to sell overseas at low prices and imposed heavy losses on the
producers whom we had by our earlier actions encouraged to expand output.
The list of similar cases could be multiplied.

Old Age and Survivor's Insurance -->

The "social security" program is one of those things on which the tyranny
of the status quo is beginning to work its magic. Despite the controversy that
surrounded its inception, it has come to be so much taken for granted that its
desirability is hardly questioned any longer. Yet it involves a large-scale invasion
into the personal lives of a large fraction of the nation without, so far as I can
see, any justification that is at all persuasive, not only on liberal principles, but
on almost any other. I propose to examine the biggest phase of it, that which
involves payments to the aged.

 As an operational matter, the program known as old age and survivor's
insurance (OASI) consists of a special tax imposed on payrolls, plus payments to
persons who have reached a specified age, of amounts determined by the age at
which payments begin, family status, and prior earning record.

 As an analytical matter, OASI consists of three separable elements:

 1. The requirement that a wide class of persons must purchase specified
annuities, i.e., compulsory provision for old age.

 2. The requirement that the annuity must be purchased from the
government; i.e., nationalization of the provision of these annuities.

 3. A scheme for redistributing income, insofar as the value of the
annuities to which people are entitled when they enter the system is not equal to
the taxes they will pay.

 Clearly, there is no necessity for these elements to be combined. Each
individual could be required to pay for his own annuity; the individual could be
permitted to purchase an annuity from private firms; yet individuals could be
required to purchase specified annuities. The government could go into the
business of selling annuities without compelling individuals to buy specified
annuities and require the business to be self-supporting. And clearly the
government can and does engage in redistribution without using the device of
annuities.

 Let us therefore consider each of these elements in turn to see how far, if
at all, each can be justified. It will facilitate our analysis, I believe, if we consider
them in reverse order.

 1. Income redistribution. The present OASI program involves two major
kinds of redistribution; from some OASI beneficiaries to others; from the general
taxpayer to OASI beneficiaries. 
151

 The first kind of redistribution is primarily from those who entered the
system relatively young, to those who entered it at an advanced age. The latter
are receiving, and will for some time be receiving, a greater amount as benefits
than the taxes they paid could have purchased. Under present tax and benefit
schedules, on the other hand, those who entered the system at a young age will
receive decidedly less.

 I do not see any grounds liberal or other on which this particular
redistribution can be defended. The subsidy to the beneficiaries is independent
of their poverty or wealth; the man of means receives it as much as the indigent.
The tax which pays the subsidy is a flat-rate tax on earnings up to a maximum.

It constitutes a larger fraction of low incomes than of high. What conceivable
justification is there for taxing the young to subsidize the old regardless of the
economic status of the old; for imposing a higher rate of tax for this purpose on
the low incomes than on the high; or, for that matter, for raising the revenues to
pay the subsidy by a tax on payrolls?

 The second kind of redistribution arises because the system is not likely to
be fully self-financing. During the period when many were covered and paying
taxes, and few had qualified for benefits, the system appeared to be selffinancing and indeed to be having a surplus. But this appearance depends on
neglecting the obligation being accumulated with respect to the persons paying
the tax. 

The taxes paid have sufficed to finance the
accumulated obligation. Many experts assert that even on a cash basis, a subsidy
will be required. And such a subsidy generally has been required in similar
systems in other countries. This is a highly technical matter which we cannot and
need not go into here and about which there can be honest differences of
opinion.
