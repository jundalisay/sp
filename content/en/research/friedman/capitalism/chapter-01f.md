Raymond Gastil The discussion has gone in many different directions
since I originally raised my hand, but let me make a few points on what
has been going on. The first point is that very clear majorities can be very
coercive, and what they do may ruin society. For example, one man one vote could ruin South Africa, no doubt about it. Nevertheless, in most situations there is very little alternative, (1), to having governments and, (2), if
you accept certain principles about equality, to having majority rule, in
spite of some of the results that may accrue from that. 

It seems to me that majority government, as oppressive, coercive, and
so on as it may be and in spite of all the theory that one might have that
unanimity or something else is a possibility or would be nicer, is really for
most situations the only available solution to the problem of power. From
that perspective, I find the remarks by Walter, for example, reminiscent
more than anything of listening to Marx speak about the terrible things
that were going on in the world. It is utopianism to say that something that
has never been anywhere on any scale—and probably because of the nature of people will not be anywhere on any scale—is the way in which we should organize our relationships.

The second point is just a thought in regard to Tibor’s point that only
individuals really have ends. That may be true in some philosophical
sense, nevertheless, in a practical sense, if we think about the fact that we
as Americans are very interested in the survival of certain values over the
future centuries that stretch out in front of us, it isn’t as appropriate to
think of those in terms of our individual wants and desires as to think of
those in terms of group wants and desires. I don’t think it is we as separate
individuals that are really interested in that long-range future, but we as
members of a collectivity.

The point that I was really going to talk about when I raised my hand
was Assar’s point having to do with the media. Let me just point to National Public Radio in the United States, which is the closest thing to a
government-owned and controlled media we have in this country, and yet
is the most consistently critical of the United States government.
Voice Republican government!
Ramon Diaz Assar Lindbeck said that he didn’t find it difficult to think
of a regime where all property was social and yet political and civil liberties remained. I think that is perfectly right, as a logical point of view. If
we think of society as made up of so many chessmen, we can arrange
them in a logical way in that sense. But I doubt that this is a very relevant
statement.
Actually, what we are talking about here has to do with the rule of law
and with competitive capitalism, and this is a very unique circumstance.
As the Friedmans say in their paper, the typical state of mankind is tyranny, servitude and misery. We are in a very, very special circumstance. I

think it is inconceivable that we could have come to this special and privileged historical circumstance if the society had been made up of civil
servants. Civil servants will not produce a society that upholds freedom.
We have a character in this great play that is enacted in Western society,
and this hero of our play is a property owner. Therefore, I think that we
have to focus on the very special characteristics that have prevailed in the
West which have produced a particular individual who thinks of himself as
a separate private individual with property rights and not as an employee
of the government.
Michael Parkin I would like to go back to the sentence that begins the
thesis of this chapter and which several people have picked up on. It
seems to me that if we think about what is being said there in just a
slightly different way from the precise words that are used, we see that the
statement really has a lot of strength. Milton and Rose distinguish between
socialism and capitalism, but they always—or almost always (as Milton
has said)—qualify the word “capitalism” with the word “competitive.” It
seems to me to be useful to think about a two-fold classification—competitive and noncompetitive arrangements; and capitalistic and socialistic
arrangements—and then ask ourselves, which is the key dimension?
We know that scarcity means that every situation has to be fundamentally competitive, but using the word in the more limited sense, to talk
about how we explicitly organize our social institutions, I wonder whether
it is the competitive rather than the socialist/capitalist dimension that
makes the difference? Think about competitive as being a situation in
which there is freedom of entry and exit. That is what makes competition
different from other arrangements. There might be only one (producer,
government or whatever), but the fact that that one got there through a
process that could have resulted in any one, or more than one, being there,
doing whatever it is, makes the situation different from a situation in
which there is one and only one there because others are excluded by explicit rules and procedures.
If we think of things in this way, I think we see that Assar is wrong in
the inferences he draws from Sweden. Sweden is an example of competitive socialism. It is competitive in the sense that it competes on the world
market to sell its output. We wouldn’t want to say that IBM is in some
sense a socialist country, but Sweden is a big organization, a big corporation, like IBM, that produces goods and services by means that do not use
the market very extensively, internally, but that sell the output competitively on the world market.

I don’t know the fraction of Swedish GNP that is traded internationally,
but it must be pretty high. That puts a discipline on the Swedish economy
that would not be there if this were a closed economic system.
Secondly, a feature of the freedom of entry and exit view was touched
on by Brian Kantor, that is, individuals who don’t want to put up with the
arrangements that are in place in Sweden are, in fact, pretty reasonably
free to take their human and physical capital and locate it somewhere else.
That also makes it a competitive environment in the same sense as before.
I will summarize very quickly just by saying that if we think about the
words “competitive” and “noncompetitive” as being more important for
this particular point than the words “socialist” and “capitalist,” we make
more sense of the original thesis and it emerges as a much more powerful
thesis.
Svetozar Pejovich I have three points. The absence of private ownership
is what I understand to be socialism. In that sense, Sweden is not a socialist state and, in that sense, Hungary is. If I have a car that belongs to the
state, I cannot sell it. And for that reason there is no market for capital
goods.
On the second point, I want to ask Mr. Friedman. What I observe is that
people trade freedom for other things, like security, marriage, the priesthood, and if this is so, then there must be diminishing marginal returns to
the freedom that people enjoy. If so, then a perfectly free society will be
an inefficient society. To me, what is important seems to be the ease of
exit, the cost of exit.
Assar Lindbeck I think we all agree that there are very important links
between political and economic systems. We are trying to discover the
character of those links. What I tried to say is that those links are much
more complex than earlier thought by Hayek and the Friedmans in their
expositions. Moreover, they are not deterministic, but they are highly
probabilistic. I think Milton should include chance and risk in these considerations as well.
There is not a monotonic relation between the size of the public sector
and individual freedom. If you go to a society where public ownership is
10 percent and increase it to 40, 50, 60 or 70 percent, you could not predict what would happen to civil liberties in that society. If public spending
increased to 65 percent of GNP in Sweden, I couldn’t say that there are
fewer civil liberties now than when the sector was 20 percent or in countries where it is presently 20 percent.

As the size of the public sector grows, freedom of choice—the possibility for an individual to change his own life situation by his own
effort—decreases. But I think that is very different from civil liberties. By
civil liberties I mean that you have elections, you have freedom of speech,
you have a competitive political system—you can feel free to criticize the
government as much as you like. That is different from the fact that it is
difficult to change your own disposable income by your own effort. I am
not saying that the latter is less important, only that it is different. We
should make distinctions between those different aspects of freedom—freedom of choice versus civil liberties.
Lastly, in Sweden there is no big risk in criticizing the government,
with some exceptions. Research institutes, for instance, that live on government funds, might think for awhile before they criticize government.
There could be some limitations there. What is more important is that people hesitate much more to criticize labour unions, because labour unions
can influence the career of a person in the sense of affecting promotions.
Labour unions do not have a truly competitive political system for choosing their leaders. You can get a new government after two or three years,
but it is very difficult to get a new political party to rule the labour union.
That is ruled by the same group of people decade after decade. So there is
a private organization besides the state which I think is much more detrimental to freedom of speech in my country than is the government
because of the lack of a competitive political system between the unions.
Finally, it is very misleading to call Sweden a socialist state. I think 7
percent of manufacturing is owned by the government—less than in practically any country in the world. It is a transfer state rather than a socialist
state.
Gordon Tullock I think we have three different things: economic freedom, which is the right to work, et cetera; civil freedom or personal
freedom, which is a large collection of things which, really on traditional
grounds we think are important, like the right to speak, and so forth; and
then finally there is the use of the voting system in some variant. I spend
most of my time trying to think of ways to make it work better, so I say
“some variant.” I agree with Block, that the use of freedom for the third
kind of freedoms is a somewhat odd use of language. It doesn’t follow
from that that I don’t think it is important. I do think it is important, but I
don’t think, strictly speaking, that freedom is the correct term to use with
it.
If you go back to the 19th century you will find the opposite of what I
am calling here the Friedman/Hayek position. You find people saying that
if you want a free economy you have to have democracy. 

This point of view vanished in the 1920s and ‘30s for rather obvious reasons. There has
been an effort to simply reverse it. I don’t see any strong reasoning for doing so. In fact, in the 19th century I think it was essentially an accidental
coincidence that economic freedom and democracy coexisted. I also think
it is essentially an accidental coincidence now.
We can be in favour of all of these freedoms without feeling that we
have to allege that they come out of each other. Some of the personal freedoms come out of the use of some kind of voting system, because you
can’t do it unless you have freedom of speech and things like that. That is
part of the voting system. But other than that, they seem to be three different things—all of which are desirable—and I don’t see any strong reason
for arguing that they are correlated.
Alan Walters I think the sort of distinction which Milton makes in his
book somewhere between totalitarianism and despotism is a very important one. Hong Kong is ruled by a despot, by the governor, but it is
completely opposite to a totalitarian society. I think that distinction tends
to be lost sometimes.
I would like to go back and support a point that Gordon made in a positive sense, and that is, it isn’t just that great art comes from these despots.
It is also true that those despots, to a very large extent, had competitive art
systems supplying them.
The second point I think is very important too. For all of their many
successes, America and Britain in their capitalist heydays have been pretty
much an artistic desert. It is tragic and it is something we cannot easily explain. There is no good art, no good music produced during these long
periods.
Raymond Gastil I made most of my points before, but let me just add
that there is a great difference between different contexts as to what are
the important and significant issues of freedom. As you move from capitalist to socialist, from government control to private control and so forth,
you have different problems arising. One thing that we have not spent
enough time on is that if you don’t have government controls that limit
freedom, you very often find that the controls come from other sources.
They might come from unions, from religion, or from business.
Walter Block Gordon agrees with me that we should put economic and
civil liberties on the one side and political freedom on the other, and even
that political freedom is sort of a misnomer. But he insists that it is important, nonetheless. I would urge that it is not quite so important. Certainly the Hong Kong example of the despotism not ruining economic liberty is
one example. Another example would be British colonial rule over Africa
and India, which was despotic in many ways but which was very beneficial in terms of economics.
Second, I don’t regard unions as private enterprises. I regard them as
bits of government or “overmighty subjects,” as Peter has called them. I
regard them as bands of criminals who compete with the government
gangs. Somehow they have wrested some legitimacy and some ability to
initiate coercion from the government. But, just like government, they do
provide some legitimate services. So they are neither fish nor fowl. But to
call them private institutions is a misnomer.
Third, about Sweden being like IBM. I am very reluctant to accept this
analogy. I see a vast difference between a voluntary organization such as
IBM, which receives its capital from the voluntary choices of investors,
and Sweden, which obtains its revenue from the involuntary taxation system.
My last point is with regard to utopians. I accept happily the notion that
I am a utopian, if, by utopian you mean all that is good and pure! And I
do mean it just that way, at least in one sense: a utopian is someone who
does not care much whether something is or is not politically feasible. A
utopian says what is right and what is not right is much more important
than what is politically feasible. Certainly, a free enterprise system now is
not really politically feasible, but I think that is really unimportant. My
concerns are for what is right and just and not for what is likely to occur
in the next couple of years.
Milton Friedman There are so many things here I don’t know quite what
to react to. But I want to start by making a few comments in connection
with Assar Lindbeck’s various comments.
I believe that Assar neglected to read the whole of the sentence which
he criticized, because it says, “A society which is socialist cannot also be
democratic, in the sense of guaranteeing individual freedom” (italics
added). And the next sentence goes on, “Economic arrangements play a
dual role...On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a
component of freedom broadly understood.” So when Assar says that socialism is not compatible with freedom of choice, he is agreeing with us
that it is not possible to have a democratic socialism which guarantees individual freedom. Because in our view economic choice is an extremely
important component of economic freedom, and not simply a means toward another end.


I agree thoroughly with Ingemar that government spending as a fraction
of income is an imperfect measure of the role of government and is not
necessarily closely related to most of the other things that we talk about.
But government influence, in the sense of controlling the activities of individuals, including redistribution of income, does severely interfere with
freedom of individuals as such. Therefore, I am not going to retreat from
believing that that sentence is basically a correct sentence.
I also will agree with him, and with Michael, that what is really relevant
is pluralism and competitiveness, and that is why in an earlier page on this
little document we got out we said that “The second broad principle is that
government power must be dispersed...If I do not like what my local community does...I can move to another local community.” I have no doubt
that a world of small, dispersed governments—even if governments in that
case owned all the means of production—could be, in principle, competitive as among the different governments and could, in principle, produce
exactly the same results as what we call a free enterprise, private enterprise, situation.
With respect to Raymond’s various comments, I want to separate myself completely from the notion of group values. Again, if I may just go
back to show that I am not making this up anew. If we say, he—and by
that I mean a liberal in my sense of the term liberal—“recognizes no national goal except as it is the consensus of the goals that the citizens
severally serve.” I believe there are such things, very important things, as
consensus about values, agreement about values, but I think the notion of
group values is a dangerous notion that inevitably leads to an organismic
concept of society and in a direction I don’t think Raymond would want to
go.
As to some of the other comments, I will make one more comment
only. I have no doubt that the best of all forms of government is benevolent dictatorship. I am not going to quarrel with that at all, and we have
had some examples in history of good, benevolent dictatorships, as in
Hong Kong, in Singapore with Lee Kuan Yew—he’s been a benevolent
dictator. The problem with benevolent dictators is that they don’t stay benevolent, which goes to Herbert’s point of what is the time period. They don’t stay benevolent, and they tend to be replaced by people who aren’t
so benevolent, and the benevolent people tend to get corrupted as well.
On to Gordon’s point about the notions contained in Hayek’s Road to
Serfdom and our Capitalism and Freedom. The key feature of Hayek’s
Road to Serfdom, as I see it, is the chapter which says the worst rise to the
top. In that respect I believe that he has been completely right. I don’t believe you can say he has been wrong. He was wrong in predicting that the
increase in the size of government measured by government spending would lead to dictatorship and totalitarianism, but what happened in the
course of the next 20 years is that the character of government expenditures and control changed. It started out in the direction of nationalization
and then it changed into redistribution. And there is no doubt that—and
this is a point Assar has been making—the effect on the tendency toward
dictatorship is quite different as between these two modes of government
expenditure.

Douglass North I want to pick up on Milton’s point about competitiveness. Actually, it relates to something Michael said earlier. It seems to me
that what is crucial about competitiveness is two aspects of it that make
institutions have greater viability. One is that competition maximizes the
chance to make mistakes and, therefore, perhaps the chance of finding successful ways to do things. Since we don’t know which ways work, we
want to maximize those opportunities. Certainly, the kind of institutions
that do that are very crucial.

Secondly, competitiveness eliminates the losers, and that is equally important. If you let the losers continue and persist in the society, then you
build into it structural weaknesses. I have a term that is not original,
“adaptive efficiency,” which is very different I think from allocative efficiency as we use it in economics. But it is related to institutions that do
maximize both the choice set that is available to people and the competitiveness, so that you wipe out losing sets of institutions.
The Northwest Ordinance, which I talk about in my paper, is a marvellous illustration of it. It provided for some very simple things like fee
simple ownership of land, easy transferability of title, inheritance laws that
were clear and simple. The result was that while downstream in U.S. history we made terrible ways of distributing land, it didn’t make much
difference because with these institutions in place we could transfer land,
as we did, to more efficient uses and ones that solved our problems better.
So the competitiveness is something that has a precise meaning in the way
I want to think about it that relates to your point and to Milton’s.
Arnold Harberger As I have been listening through the discussion this
morning and also from the very beginning, looking at the title of the conference, I felt that this was a topic that could easily fall prey to semantics
and definitions, to creating categories and arguing between them. Now,
there is nothing wrong with all of that, but I think we should recognize,
for the efficiency of our discussion, that it is a trap that we could easily
fall into.
I would like to try to help the discussion get a bit more concrete by
speaking a little from my own experience. I float around in Latin America a lot, and I also try to study economic growth around the world a fair
amount. There is a question that really gets me sometimes, especially in
ideological discussions in Latin America. They keep pounding me. They
say, in effect, that the kind of economics I am selling is okay, but it is
only dictatorial, autocratic governments that can really do it.
It has been bothersome to me to have to agree with this view to some
extent. The problem is that we all like all the freedoms. If we only liked
one, it would be easy. I look at the actual historical record of Hong Kong,
Singapore, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Spain in the latter decade of Franco,
Portugal, Brazil, in each case, its economic miracle took place under an
autocratic government. Chile has had two spates (of which it is currently
in one) where it has outperformed its neighbours, largely as a consequence
of this type of policy. While not many seem to be aware of the fact, Guatemala and Nicaragua, starting around 1950, had very good growth under
autocratic government. The reality is that these governments have had
better than average economic performance under that kind of rule.
My first response is, we are economists, we know that other freedoms
are a part of our value system; we have to be willing to pay a price. And
that is really where I sit when I have to. But at the same time I wonder
what is the secret there? Why are these essentially autocratic regimes
seemingly more successful than other regimes?
First of all, let me note that most of these autocracies seem to turn into
technocracies. They tend to acquire a higher proportion of technocrats, and
this transition seems in some way to be important for the growth process.
The reason appears to be that the technocracy in turn imposes a discipline
and self-restraint on government. It keeps government small when a lot of
populist and other pressures are trying to make it bigger. Autocratic government seems to be able to impose self-restraint and to avoid doing a lot
of things that it would be pressured to do in a more open political system.
Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, autocratic governments often
bring discipline, restraint and predictability to the economic scene, which
before had been chaotic. It is this transition that is the common thread in
these various success stories.
But, I can also think of three cases of democratic governments which
have been successful in the growth encouraging game—Switzerland, Japan, and Panama. Switzerland is an old democracy but very self-restrictive
by the nature of its constitution; nothing can happen in Switzerland,
hardly. Japan in the modern world is a democracy, but they have a lot of
built-in self-restraint by their culture. Panama had built-in restraint by having the dollar as a circulating medium and having a prohibition against
having a central bank. But during the 1960s, when it led the Western
Hemisphere in the rate of growth, it didn’t have the tendency to populism that later infected and ultimately overwhelmed it in the late 1970s and
early 1980s.
So, here are three cases where democracy has worked to produce high
rates of growth, in all of which the elements of discipline and restraint,
and in a certain sense predictability, have been present.
Raymond Gastil I think insofar as that is true, I would have some questions about the democracies in each case, and particularly in the case of
Panama. But perhaps we don’t wish to get into that at the moment.
Alvin Rabushka First of all, I don’t have a dictionary with me, but I
think the word “despotic” conveys some norms and modes of behaviour.
Hong Kong is not despotic; please stop calling it despotic. Call it regulated, call it night watchman, call it authoritarian, call it unrepresentative,
call it administrative no-party state, but stop calling it despotic.
The second thing is precisely the point that Arnold was making—this
notion about semantics and language and what these words mean. Words
have meanings, and we have to talk about them in some way or we can’t
talk about the subject. I think we all have a sense about what civil liberties
are, and I’d buy the Freedom House list intact. I think we have some
pretty good senses of what economic freedoms are, and in my own paper I
basically enumerate the Friedman bill of rights and add three or four more,
which I think he might be willing to buy as well. So I think we can get
around that.
Now we get to the political problem, and Block is right. But I think we
can amend that a little bit. The way I would like to talk about it is to talk
about political freedoms having imbedded within them, shall we say, some
kind of constitutional, written or unwritten custom limitations on the abilities of those majorities to take away the rights of individuals and
minorities. If we can do something like that, I think we would get a better
handle on what we mean by political freedom that won’t bother us all that
much.

But the last point is this whole question of running around the world
looking at other countries, and Latin America is one of the few places I
haven’t gone to look at. One thing I did do at a prior Liberty Fund Symposium and in some other papers was take a hundred countries in the
developing world in the post-war period and then take the Freedom House
data and look at their scores on civil liberties and look at their scores on
political rights, and I discovered the following.

First of all, civil liberties and political freedoms come out reasonably
similar when you simply do a cross classification against some economic
factors (I will tell you what those are in a minute), which means there is a
very high internal overlap between the presence of political rights and civil
liberties as measured in the Freedom House scores. And that is very encouraging. It means that if you are going to have political rights, you can
have civil liberties, and vice versa. You don’t have to choose one over the
other. So you don’t have to worry about the majorities tyrannizing civil
liberties out of existence.

Now, in terms of what these economic variables were, I used two: one
was per capita income, and the other was rates of growth over the last 20
years, that is, per capita rates of growth in income. The results come out
reasonably the same; that is, countries that have had very high rates of
economic growth for 20 years now have a reasonably high per capita income. Countries that have had very low growth rates don’t. The results
came out reasonably similar, and they are as follows.

Where there is zero or low growth—I mean negative growth up to 1 or
2 percent—and per capita incomes are $400 and under, there are almost no
civil liberties and political rights. In countries that have high rates of economic growth and per capita incomes over a thousand, or seven hundred
and up, there is a fifty-fifty mix, between countries that have high civil
liberties and not and countries that have high political rights and not. So
stagnation and poverty are just iron-clad guarantees of not having any
freedoms. Prosperity gives you some chance of getting some of the liberties.
In this context, I think what Arnold has described as a cross-sectional
phenomenon also is exhibited longitudinally. What is clearly happening in
Taiwan and in Korea—for that matter, mainland China and some other
places—is there is a gradual emerging of civil liberties and political rights
that didn’t exist in the first instance. So affluence is a kind of nice breeding ground in many of these countries for a much looser society, a much less restricted, a much less controlled society. On the basis of the evidence, I am willing to go on the line and simply say that if one can impose the kinds of growth-oriented policies that work, one will
get—down the road a generation later, in those places where it has had a
chance to work—probably many more rights and freedoms than there were
in the beginning or than there are in other countries which are similar except for the growth experience.
Gordon Tullock I would deduce from these numbers that you have given
that a country that has a per capita income of about $150 a year could
never have freedom. I am, of course, referring to the United States in

1776. But going on from that, actually what I wanted to talk about is that
we observe that a dictatorship sometimes is successful economically and
democracy sometimes is successful economically. As a result of the fact
that a lot of democracies in the great 19th century were leading countries,
both in economy and politics, a lot of them are still pretty wealthy. I am
sure that is the reason the United States is still pretty wealthy. Although
we had the advantage that the 19th century, in our case, lasted right
through to the 1930s. So we left the 19th century somewhat later than anyone else.
There is another possible explanatory variable, an unpopular one.
Again, this is found in pre-World War II or even pre-World War I literature. The anthropologists divide the European culture up into 3 main groups, by language, actually: Slavic, Latin and Teutonic. There is an
overwhelming correlation between being members of that Teutonic group
and being both prosperous and democratic, and also, I should say, being
protestant. It may be that we are simply talking about a characteristic of
one particular subculture within the European collection. I sincerely hope
not.
