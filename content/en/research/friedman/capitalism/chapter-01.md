It is widely believed that politics and economics are separate and largely
unconnected; that individual freedom is a political problem and material
welfare an economic problem; and that any kind of political arrangements
can be combined with any kind of economic arrangements. 

The chief contemporary manifestation of this idea is the advocacy of “democratic socialism” by many who condemn out of hand the restrictions on individual freedom imposed by “totalitarian socialism” in Russia, and who are persuaded that it is possible for a country to adopt the essential features of Russian economic arrangements and yet to ensure individual freedom
through political arrangements. The thesis of this chapter is that such a
view is a delusion, that there is an intimate connection between economics
and politics, that only certain combinations of political and economic arrangements are possible, and that in particular, a society which is socialist cannot also be democratic, in the sense of guaranteeing individual freedom.
Economic arrangements play a dual role in the promotion of a free society. On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a
component of freedom broadly understood, so economic freedom is an end
in itself. 

In the second place, economic freedom is also an indispensable
means toward the achievement of political freedom.

The first of these roles of economic freedom needs special emphasis because intellectuals in particular have a strong bias against regarding this
aspect of freedom as important. They tend to express contempt for what
they regard as material aspects of life, and to regard their own pursuit of
allegedly higher values as on a different plane of significance and as deserving of special attention. For most citizens of the country, however, if
not for the intellectual, the direct importance of economic freedom is at
least comparable in significance to the indirect importance of economic
freedom as a means to political freedom.

The citizen of Great Britain, who after World War II was not permitted
to spend his vacation in the United States because of exchange control,
was being deprived of an essential freedom no less than the citizen of the
United States, who was denied the opportunity to spend his vacation in
Russia because of his political views. The one was ostensibly an economic
limitation on freedom and the other a political limitation, yet there is no
essential difference between the two.

The citizen of the United States who is compelled by law to devote
something like 10 per cent of his income to the purchase of a particular
kind of retirement contract, administered by the government, is being deprived of a corresponding part of his personal freedom. How strongly this
deprivation may be felt and its closeness to the deprivation of religious
freedom, which all would regard as “civil” or “political” rather than “economic,” were dramatized by an episode involving a group of farmers of
the Amish sect. On rounds of principle, this group regarded compulsory
federal old age programs as an infringement of their personal individual
freedom and refused to pay taxes or accept benefits. As a result, some of
their livestock were sold by auction in order to satisfy claims for social security levies. True, the number of citizens who regard compulsory old age insurance as a deprivation of freedom may be few, but the believer in freedom has never counted noses.

A citizen in the United States who under the laws of various states is
not free to follow the occupation of his own choosing unless he can get a
license for it, is likewise being deprived of an essential part of his freedom. So is the man who would like to exchange some of his goods with, say, a Swiss for a watch but is prevented from doing so by a quota. So
also is the Californian who was thrown into jail for selling Alka Seltzer at
a price below that set by the manufacturer under so-called “fair trade”
laws. So also is the farmer who cannot grow the amount of wheat he
wants. And so on. Clearly, economic freedom, in and of itself, is an extremely important part of total freedom.
Viewed as a means to the end of political freedom, economic arrangements are important because of their effect on the concentration or
dispersion of power. The kind of economic organization that provides economic freedom directly, namely, competitive capitalism, also promotes
political freedom because it separates economic power from political
power and in this way enables the one to offset the other.
Historical evidence speaks with a single voice on the relation between
political freedom and a free market. I know of no example in time or place
of a society that has been marked by a large measure of political freedom,
and that has not also used something comparable to a free market to organize the bulk of economic activity.
Because we live in a largely free society, we tend to forget how limited
is the span of time and the part of the globe for which there has ever been
anything like political freedom: the typical state of mankind is tyranny,
servitude, and misery. The nineteenth century and early twentieth century
in the Western world stand out as striking exceptions to the general trend
of historical development. Political freedom in this instance clearly came
along with the free market and the development of capitalist institutions.
So also did political freedom in the golden age of Greece and in the early
days of the Roman era.
History suggests only that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom. Clearly it is not a sufficient condition. Fascist Italy and
Fascist Spain, Germany at various times in the last seventy years, Japan
before World Wars I and II, czarist Russia in the decades before World
War I—are all societies that cannot conceivably be described as politically
free. Yet, in each, private enterprise was the dominant form of economic
organization. It is therefore clearly possible to have economic arrangements that are fundamentally capitalist and political arrangements that are
not free.

Even in those societies, the citizenry had a good deal more freedom
than citizens of a modern totalitarian state like Russia or Nazi Germany, in
which economic totalitarianism is combined with political totalitarianism.
Even in Russia under the Tzars, it was possible for some citizens, under
some circumstances, to change their jobs without getting permission from
political authority because capitalism and the existence of private property
provided some check to the centralized power of the state.
The relation between political and economic freedom is complex and by
no means unilateral. In the early nineteenth century, Bentham and the
Philosophical Radicals were inclined to regard political freedom as a
means to economic freedom. They believed that the masses were being
hampered by the restrictions that were being imposed upon them, and that
if political reform gave the bulk of the people the vote, they would do
what was good for them, which was to vote for laissez faire. In retrospect,
one cannot say that they were wrong. There was a large measure of political reform that was accompanied by economic reform in the direction of a
great deal of laissez faire. An enormous increase in the well-being of the
masses followed this change in economic arrangements.
The triumph of Benthamite liberalism in nineteenth-century England
was followed by a reaction toward increasing intervention by government
in economic affairs. This tendency to collectivism was greatly accelerated,
both in England and elsewhere, by the two World Wars. Welfare rather
than freedom became the dominant note in democratic countries. Recognizing the implicit threat to individualism, the intellectual descendants of
the Philosophical Radicals—Dicey, Mises, Hayek, and Simons, to mention
only a few—feared that a continued movement toward centralized control
of economic activity would prove The Road to Serfdom, as Hayek entitled
his penetrating analysis of the process. Their emphasis was on economic
freedom as a means toward political freedom.
Events since the end of World War II display still a different relation
between economic and political freedom. Collectivist economic planning
has indeed interfered with individual freedom. At least in some countries,
however, the result has not been the suppression of freedom, but the reversal of economic policy. England again provides the most striking example.
The turning point was perhaps the “control of engagements” order which,
despite great misgivings, the Labour party found it necessary to impose in
order to carry out its economic policy. Fully enforced and carried through,
the law would have involved centralized allocation of individuals to occupations. This conflicted so sharply with personal liberty that it was
enforced in a negligible number of cases, and then repealed after the law
had been in effect for only a short period. Its repeal ushered in a decided
shift in economic policy, marked by reduced reliance on centralized “plans” and “programs,” by the dismantling of many controls, and by increased emphasis on the private market. A similar shift in policy occurred
in most other democratic countries.
The proximate explanation of these shifts in policy is the limited success of central planning or its outright failure to achieve stated objectives.
However, this failure is itself to be attributed, at least in some measure, to
the political implications of central planning and to an unwillingness to
follow out its logic when doing so requires trampling rough-shod on treasured private rights. It may well be that the shift is only a temporary
interruption in the collectivist trend of this century. Even so, it illustrates
the close relation between political freedom and economic arrangements.
Historical evidence by itself can never be convincing. Perhaps it was
sheer coincidence that the expansion of freedom occurred at the same time
as the development of capitalist and market institutions. Why should there
be a connection? What are the logical links between economic and political freedom? In discussing these questions we shall consider first the
market as a direct component of freedom, and then the indirect relation between market arrangements and political freedom. A by-product will be an
outline of the ideal economic arrangements for a free society.
As liberals, we take freedom of the individual, or perhaps the family, as
our ultimate goal in judging social arrangements. Freedom as a value in
this sense has to do with the interrelations among people; it has no meaning whatsoever to a Robinson Crusoe on an isolated island (without his
Man Friday). Robinson Crusoe on his island is subject to “constraint,” he
has limited “power,” and he has only a limited number of alternatives, but
there is no problem of freedom in the sense that is relevant to our discussion. Similarly, in a society freedom has nothing to say about what an
individual does with his freedom; it is not an all-embracing ethic. Indeed,
a major aim of the liberal is to leave the ethical problem for the individual
to wrestle with. The “really” important ethical problems are those that face
an individual in a free society—what he should do with his freedom.
There are thus two sets of values that a liberal will emphasize—the values
that are relevant to relations among people, which is the context in which
he assigns first priority to freedom; and the values that are relevant to the
individual in the exercise of his freedom, which is the realm of individual
ethics and philosophy.


The liberal conceives of men as imperfect beings. He regards the problem of social organization to be as much a negative problem of preventing
“bad” people from doing harm as of enabling “good” people to do good;
and, of course, “bad” and “good” people may be the same people, depending on who is judging them.



The existence of a free market does not of course eliminate the need for
government. On the contrary, government is essential both as a forum for
determining the “rules of the game” and as an umpire to interpret and enforce the rules decided on. What the market does is to reduce greatly the
range of issues that must be decided through political means, and thereby
to minimize the extent to which government need participate directly in
the game. The characteristic feature of action through political channels is
that it tends to require or enforce substantial conformity. The great advantage of the market, on the other hand, is that it permits wide diversity. It
is, in political terms, a system of proportional representation. Each man
can vote, as it were, for the colour of tie he wants and get it; he does not
have to see what colour the majority wants and then, if he is in the minority, submit.
It is this feature of the market that we refer to when we say that the
market provides economic freedom. But this characteristic also has implications that go far beyond the narrowly economic. Political freedom means
the absence of coercion of a man by his fellow men. The fundamental
threat to freedom is power to coerce, be it in the hands of a monarch, a
dictator, an oligarchy, or a momentary majority. The preservation of freedom requires the elimination of such concentration of power to the fullest
possible extent and the dispersal and distribution of whatever power cannot be eliminated—a system of checks and balances. By removing the
organization of economic activity from the control of political authority,
the market eliminates this source of coercive power. It enables economic
strength to be a check to political power rather than a reinforcement.
Economic power can be widely dispersed. There is no law of conservation which forces the growth of new centers of economic strength to be at
the expense of existing centers. Political power, on the other hand, is more
difficult to decentralize. There can be numerous small independent governments. But it is far more difficult to maintain numerous equipotent small
centers of political power in a single large government than it is to have
numerous centers of economic strength in a single large economy. There
can be many millionaires in one large economy. But can there be more
than one really outstanding leader, one person on whom the energies and
enthusiasms of his countrymen are centered? If the central government
gains power, it is likely to be at the expense of local governments. There
seems to be something like a fixed total of political power to be distributed. Consequently, if economic power is joined to political power,
concentration seems almost inevitable. On the other hand, if economic
power is kept in separate hands from political power, it can serve as a
check and a counter to political power.


Discussion

Edited by Michael A. Walker
Milton Friedman I am going to make a couple of comments. In reading
all of these papers, including our own, we have been impressed with the
problems that arise out of confusing ends and means. This is a symposium
on three things: economic, political and civil freedoms. Each of those in
turn can be viewed either as ends or means. But if you look at them first
as ends, they are by no means exclusive, they by no means cover the major ends that have moved people or societies. You would have to include
in any such list, today at least, and earlier, egalitarianism or equality,
which many people would regard as an ultimate end, with economic, political or civil freedom as means toward that end. You can look at the
question of nationalism. Certainly nationalistic sentiment has served a
more important role in moving peoples and producing major changes and
conflicts than has the search for economic, political or civil freedom! And
prosperity or economic growth can be viewed something as an end in itself
rather than as a means.
But I was going to limit my comments to the three we have chosen for
topics for this session. And for us, each of these separately can be an end
or a means, and I thought the papers illustrated that divergence quite well.
For Rose and me, civil freedom is the end—a single end—and economic
or political freedom are means toward that end. Our position is fundamentally that of the Declaration of Independence: that we hold these truths to
be self-evident; that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by
their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness (which of course should have been
property, as it was in the original source); that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men.
Well and good, but if governments are instituted among men to secure
these rights, then political freedom or political arrangements can’t be an
ultimate end; they are a means. Economic arrangements are more complicated, because economic freedom is part and parcel of civil freedom, as
we have argued and everybody would agree. But in addition to that, economic arrangements are a means toward the end of civil freedom. They
are a means towards the end not only of economic freedom but of all other
freedoms. From that point of view, we regard emphasis on market arrangements not as an end in itself but as a means toward a much greater end.

On the other hand, to Gastil and Wright, as I interpret their paper, political freedom is the essential component, and they regard civil freedom and
economic freedom as means toward political freedom. For example, the
freedom to speak is not an ultimate right at all; it is simply a necessary
condition for achieving representation in political government, as I interpret their argument. In the same way, in their argument, economic freedom
is not part of an ultimate end, it is purely a means. I think these two approaches lead to very different kinds of conclusions and very different
ways of analysing the material.
If we take the third, economic freedom, to many people that seems to
be an ultimate end in itself. You want growth or prosperity, you want to
have a great, wealthy country, or for that matter, prosperous people. Many
of the people who live in the United States who are called conservatives
belong in this category. They are strong believers in free markets and what
is called capitalism, while not being concerned at all with maintaining a
large number of other freedoms, particularly civil freedoms, or, for that
matter, political freedoms. That draws a sharp line in which Gastil and
Wright and we agree—that the issue is not capitalism, whatever that may
mean, versus socialism.
Capitalism isn’t a guarantee of human freedom. It is only competitive
capitalism that serves fundamentally as a means toward human freedom or
civil freedom, which we regard as the ultimate objective. That is why in
our book, Capitalism and Freedom, we almost never refer to capitalism
alone—we refer to “competitive capitalism” in order to make the distinction. But again, the Gastil and Wright point of view is very different. From
their point of view, the only role of capitalism is as a means to permit sufficient decentralization of power in order to be able to have a political
structure under which the leadership can change from time to time.
I am not going to come out anywhere. We were reminded, when we
came to this point of thinking about what we would say, about that famous
story about the high official who had a speech written for him. He read
page after page, and he said, “Now the solution to all these problems is...”
and the next page said, “Now you’re on your own!” (Laughter)
So now you are on your own.
Gordon Tullock I want to make two supplementary comments. The first
is that that Declaration of Independence, which you read, was written by a
man who was a very large-scale slave holder, and a large number of the
people who signed it—and perhaps a majority, I don’t know—were also
large-scale slave holders.

I had the good fortune to attend the Volker Fund Conference at Wabash
College where Milton Friedman first presented the lectures which became
Capitalism and Freedom. I can assure him that these lectures had a major
impact on my thought. This impact was reinforced when I later read the
book. The book, of course, was a major extension of the lectures, but so
close in style and reasoning that I am unable to remember now what it was
that I heard and what I only read. Nevertheless, as discussant, it is my
duty to criticize.
Fortunately, as the Friedmans will no doubt be happy to hear, my criticisms are the same as for The Road to Serfdom, another book which had a
major intellectual impact on me. The authors of both of these books, I now
think, had cloudy crystal balls. 





The basic problem with The Road to Serfdom was that it offered predictions which turned out to be false. The
steady advance of government in places such as Sweden has not led to any
loss of non-economic freedoms. This is particularly impressive because I
doubt that any government before 1917 had obtained control of anything
even close to the 65 percent of GNP now flowing through the Swedish
government. I know many Swedes (and also Norse, Danes, Dutch and
English) who are very upset with the sacrifice of control over so much of
their earnings, but none who regard themselves as unfree in any other
sense.
But let me digress to another point. The Friedmans say, “the great advances of civilization, whether architecture or painting, in science or
literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized
government.” No one who has ever passed through the Gate of Heavenly
Peace will deny that centralized despotism can produce brilliant architecture. There is, of course, the collection of churches in Byzantium, of
Mosques in Isfahan and the great hypostyle hall at Karnak as further evidence. Indeed, if you are, as I am, an inveterate tourist, in Europe you will
frequently find yourself in architectural gems that were put up by despotic
governments.
It isn’t only architecture. El Greco lived in the Toledo of the high Inquisition. The French regard the period of Louis XIV as in many ways the
high point of their culture. Chinese painting and poetry flourished over
2000 years of centralized despotism. With respect to agriculture, the development of large centralized systems of irrigation supported most of the
human race (Europeans were a small minority until recently). These systems either were developed by the government or their masters became the
government.
As far as science is concerned, we believe that it began in Babylonia
under the control of rather centralized despotic governments, but the early
history is still rather poor. The flourishing of Greek science is of course
Discussion 61

well known. The later period of Greek science in which it was controlled
by the despotic and centralized Ptolemid state was far from contemptible.
Euclid, after all, wrote in Alexandria.
The revival of science after the Middle Ages occurred in Western Europe and originally in rather despotic states, although the trailing off of
feudalism meant that they weren’t centralized. Galileo did a good deal of
his work in Medici Florence, and indeed, the first scientific academy was
founded there. Further, with time, France and Spain became highly centralized. It would be extremely difficult to argue that science progressed
more rapidly in the rather decentralized environment of England than in
the highly centralized French monarchy. Lavosier, to name but one example, was a subject of Louis XVI who was executed by the Republic.


In general, in the 19th century most of Europe developed fairly strong
democratic trends, although not necessarily decentralization, and this was a
great scientific period in Europe. The regression to despotic governments
in the 20th century, however, did not necessarily change that. Mussolini’s
Italy retained its high scientific traditions, particularly in physics. Even in
Hitler’s Germany, the two-thirds of the scientific community who stayed
(the ones who were permitted to stay) continued to do distinguished and
important work.

I suspect that both Friedman and Hayek have been very much affected
by the Communist and Nazi dictatorships. It should be kept in mind, however, that these are extremely bizarre and unusual forms of government.

Most of the human race has lived under what can only be described as
mild autocracies. (I have just finished a book on autocracies, so I feel authoritative on this subject.

1) These autocracies were far, far from mild with
respect to those people who chose to take an active role in politics. For the
average citizen, however, the government was neither very oppressive nor
very beneficial.

The economic policy followed by most of these despots doesn’t
differ too much from what has been followed by most historic democracies. Athens and Rome, after all, had price control over basic necessities.

Indeed, the bread of Rome was largely provided directly by the Roman
state. Anyone living today realizes that democracies muddle around a good
deal in their economies, just like despots.

Most despots have, to repeat, not done a great deal in their economy,
not because they have any theoretical objections to it, but because they are
busy with other things, such as their harem. I recently acquired a book2
which is a translation of a general guide for local officials under the old
Chinese Empire. The official slogan of the Chinese Empire from the time
of Mencious was: “The government should own all important industries and carefully control the rest.” No doubt the author of this book believed
in that slogan, but as a matter of fact, in this very thick book he devotes
almost no attention to economic control. The only conspicuous example of
intervention in the economy was his decision that the wine shops located
directly across from the entrance of his Yamen were overcharging their
customers. He imposed price control on them.

Mainly, however, he was occupied in holding court, collecting taxes,
and performing the many other duties of governing about 100,000 people.
Once again, despots, like democracies, when they do engage in government intervention in the economy, tend to be responding to rent-seeking
activities of well-organized political groups rather than carrying out anything we would refer to as planning. As far as I know, none of the early
despotisms engaged in anywhere near as much detailed economic intervention into their economics as is normal in present day democracies.
As I remarked, the type of dictatorship we tend to think of as totalitarian—Stalin, Hitler, Mao Tse Tung, et cetera—is a very unusual
phenomenon historically. So is democracy. It is not surprising then that
there are no coincidences. I should say, however, that I doubt that this
kind of government could operate with a true democracy, not because it
would necessarily be able to strangle the democracy but because the voters
would surely throw the rascals out.
Having said that I disagree with this aspect of what we may call the
Hayek-Friedman argument, there is another sense in which there is no
doubt that capitalism and freedom are closely connected. This is a sense
which the Friedmans emphasize much more than Hayek. My freedom to
spend my income as I wish is surely of great importance to me. It is
equally surely a freedom, although many people on the left would deny
that. Further, my freedom to move from one government system to another
without too much inconvenience is another freedom, and it puts governments into competition with each other.
With respect to the last, I should say that it does not really require democracy. I have recently seen an investigation of the situation in Germany
before the unification of that state, and discovered the individual princes,
counts, et cetera behaved very much as businessmen do today. They realized they had no monopolistic power because the peasant could move
down the road a few miles, and they attempted to maximize profits on
their “enterprise” using low production costs and a high level of service in
order to attract customers.
One of the arguments for a free economy is false. It doesn’t follow that
the free economy is not important or that it does not lead to individual
freedom. The freedom that it gives, however, is economic freedom. There
Discussion 63
copyright The Fraser Institute
is no reason why we should be ashamed of that, or regard that as in any
sense a criticism of the system. Arguments for political freedom are
strong, as are the arguments for economic freedom. We needn’t make one
set of arguments depend on the other.
But the principal problem I wish to talk about is not about economic but
political freedom. At the time I read Hayek’s book and heard Friedman’s
lecture, it seemed to me very reasonable that a government which completely dominated the economic system would suppress political freedom.
Alas, for those of us who follow another aspect of Friedman’s work and
believe in empirical testing, in present-day Sweden the government takes
control of 63 percent of the GNP. Most of the other North European countries have somewhat similar shares. It is hard to argue that there is any
lack of political freedom in any of these countries, nor does there seem to
be any evidence that political freedom is declining. This should not be
taken as praise of these governments; indeed I think they are very objectionable. But the apparent logical connection between government control
of a large part of the economy and the loss of political freedom is only apparent.
Milton Friedman I only want to point out one thing, and that is one of
the major reasons why this conference was called and took the approach it
did was precisely because of the kind of empirical evidence you end up
with—which leads us to the conclusion that our initial belief, that these
went together as closely as they did, was wrong. I would cite as my main
example Hong Kong rather than Sweden, in the sense that there is almost
no doubt that if you had political freedom in Hong Kong you would have
much less economic and civil freedom than you do as a result of an authoritarian government.
Raymond Gastil The biggest difference between our approach and Milton’s has to do with the difference between emphasis on the individual and
emphasis on the group. I will turn to that more in the discussion of our
own paper later on.
Specifically, in regard to Milton’s discussion today, the first point to be
made is that it is quite possible that none of these three should be regarded
as the end—neither economic, political nor civil freedoms or rights. I
would think the end lies outside those three. I am not going to define what
it is, but there are a lot of words around like joy and love and human betterment with which one can go in various directions. But the fact that I do
a survey of political and civil rights doesn’t mean I think those are ends.
64 Discussion

The second point is that I think one should distinguish between absolutes and ends. One could say, for example, that freedom of speech is an
absolute. But I don’t think freedom of speech should be regarded as an
end.
The third point is that it is true that as far as the Survey is concerned,
we talk about those civil rights that are supportive of political rights. So,
we emphasize one group of civil rights or civil liberties and de-emphasize
other kinds of civil liberties because they don’t really contribute as directly
to the legitimacy of political rights. That doesn’t mean we regard them as
less important. It just means that for the purpose of the Survey that is what
we do, because that seems to make a neat package which goes together
nicely. But the other civil liberties might, in fact, be just as important in
the general scheme of things.
Assar Lindbeck I would like to follow up on a very strong statement
made by Gordon Tullock: “There is an intimate connection between economics and politics, in that only certain combinations of political and
economic arrangements are possible, and that, in particular, a society
which is socialist cannot also be democratic in the sense of guaranteeing
individual freedom.” I don’t see any reasons why that should be true, either from an a priori point of view or from empirical experience. I have no
difficulty imagining a society where the means of production are owned
by the government but you still have elections every year, where
state-owned newspapers publish articles on people from different parties,
et cetera, provided there were pluralistic political structures in the country
from the very beginning. I agree that there may be a low probability of a
pluralistic political culture under those circumstances, but I really see no
impossibility.
Sweden was mentioned as an example where 65 percent of the GNP
goes through the government budget, half with transfer payments and the
other half in public spending on goods and services, and we are going to
discuss that another day. Austria is another example where some 40 percent of the manufacturing sector is owned by the public sector. I could
imagine that even if 95 percent or one hundred percent were owned by
government, you could still have civil liberties, elections and freedom of
speech.
A crucial point is control over or the ownership of mass media and
newspapers. It is very tempting for a ruling party to control mass media,
as it tried to do with television in France, for instance. If the government
owns all mass media, then civil liberties and freedom of speech might go
down considerably. But if you make an exception and let private individuDiscussion 65
copyright The Fraser Institute
als, organizations and political parties own mass media, I think you could
very well have a democratic society.
Voice Where would they get their paper from?
Assar Lindbeck That is an open question. I agree with you that there are
larger risks for authoritarian regimes if government owns the mass media.
But I don’t see it as logically impossible. That’s my only point.
What I see as threatened by government ownership is, first of all, pluralism. You could have freedom of speech, but a pluralistic political
culture might be difficult because people would be afraid to use freedom
of speech if there were only one career in society, that is, through the government. You could have non-pluralistic democracies with elections every
four years and freedom of speech, but they would not be very vital political cultures. Mexico might be such an example, where everybody has to
make a career through the same political party. If one party completely
dominates, political democracy might not be very vital, but I think it could
still exist.
In my opinion, where a very big government really intrudes on individual freedom—that is really what Gordon Tullock said—is through its
impact on disposable income. If you pay tax at 90 percent of your income,
you cannot influence your own economic situation by your own effort. Or,
if government rations goods and services, you don’t have much freedom
of choice. If there are government monopolies, you cannot choose different types of services; you have to rely on government services. So it is
really pluralism and freedom of choice rather than civil liberties that are
threatened.
Tibor Machan One of the points raised by Milton Friedman and Raymond Gastil has to do with ends versus means. I think only individual
persons can have ends. They may get together with others in their pursuit
of ends. But individuals have ends, and thus social and political institutions are means for individuals to pursue certain ends of theirs.
The other thing upon which I want to comment is whether a society that
has socialist or statist laws must thwart freedom in all areas. Let me take
the analogy of a zoo. There are zoos with very small cages where the animals can’t do anything, and there are zoos like the San Diego Wild
Animal Park which is practically not a zoo. Nevertheless there are certain
limits; both are zoos.
In Hungary, for example, there is officially a Soviet-style socialism, but
most bureaucrats don’t bother to implement it. So people go to Hungary and come away and say, “See, the thawing of socialism.” It has nothing to
do with the thawing of socialism; there is practically no socialism going
on in many parts of Hungary. I don’t think that the fact they give lip service to socialist ideology should be taken seriously in our discussion of the
practical effects of political and economic institutions.
Walter Block I would like to approach the original Friedman thesis from
a different perspective, although I think Tibor’s points are very well taken.
I would like to attempt to make a serious bifurcation between economic
and civil freedom on the one hand and political freedom on the other hand.
I claim that the former two are legitimate forms of freedom but that the
latter is not. I would go so far as to say that political freedom is an oxymoron or a contradiction in terms.
By freedom, what I mean is the absence of initiatory coercion, or that
there is no violation of personal legitimate property rights. Now, economic
freedom under this rubric is easy to understand; it defends the right to
trade or to engage in any consensual activity of an economic sort. Civil
freedom would mandate that there be no laws against pornography, prostitution, drugs, religion, free speech, et cetera.
But political freedom is very different. Economic and civil freedom are
just capitalist acts or non-capitalist acts between consenting adults. Now, if
politics is, as I contend, just a futures market in stolen goods, then political
freedom is only a right to get in on this ganglike behaviour. If we do not
have it, all we are kept away from is the right to control other people’s
lives—and that, improperly. If there are no elections, and we have no government, or we have a benevolent government that doesn’t violate
economic or civil freedoms, then we are free.
On the other hand, we can have all the political freedom we want, and
if the majority votes for rent control, as it does in the People’s Republic of
Santa Monica or New York City, then we have “political freedom,” which
is a misnomer. What we have really is a warlike activity where people
gang up on other people and determine what they can or cannot do with
their own property. This is not political freedom; this is just licence. This
is allowing people to control other people unjustly. Economic and civil
freedom are legitimate freedoms, political freedom is not.
Ingemar Stahl If I remember my history, most of the constitutions and
political systems we call democratic were instituted to control a despot or
a king with a very limited size of the public sector. We are now using exactly the same system to run economies where 65 percent of the economy
is channelled through the public sector. So, of course, it would be remarkable if political freedom in the sense of controlling a despot would apply
to the situation of controlling 65 percent of GNP.

While Tullock made a plug for public choice, I want to make a plug for
Wicksell. This is the 90-year anniversary of the publishing of his text
wherein he proposed the unanimity rule as the basic rule for government.
We must remember that political freedom in everyday talk, even including
the Friedmans’ paper, is a kind of acceptance of a democratic system
where the majority rules. But I think we could sharpen the conditions and
say that we should also include protection of minorities, for example, by
qualified majorities, or that there should be some restrictions on the competence of government. It is a little bit dangerous here—and I will take
that up later when we come to the Gastil/Wright paper—to put an equals
sign between democratic institutions where the majority rules and political
freedom.
I think we should be more interested, as economists, in looking at the
unanimity principle as the basic principle of democracy, which can then be
compromised by accepting a qualified majority or certain restrictions on
all government behaviour. Majority rule has created 40 percent ownership
of industry in Austria. Majority rule has created 65 percent channelled
through the public sector and most of the services and transfers in Sweden.
There is a lot of coercion included in the majority rule concept, even
though we find it somewhat difficult to accept the strong statement of the
point in the form that Walter Block, for example, is inclined to make it. If
we say lack of coercion is the most basic political freedom, we are back to
having to advance the unanimity principle.
Milton Friedman I just wanted to clarify that in Capitalism and Freedom
we explicitly take the position you just took. We take the position that the
only real principle is unanimity. The majority rule is an expedient, and
various forms of qualified majorities are various forms of expedients. So
there is absolutely no difference between your view and the one we expressed in Capitalism and Freedom.
Peter Bauer Autocracy is compatible limited government. I should like
to refer to two sayings, one from the 18th century, the other contemporary.
Dr. Johnson said, in the 18th century, “Public affairs vex no man.” He
meant two things by that. First, that when people complain about the government they more often than not project their own private unhappiness in
various ways. But it was also an apt comment in the middle of the 18th
century, because government was so limited in its impact on people that
this statement had much greater validity then than now. Second, it used to
be said before the war in British Malaya that the Chinese there did not
mind who owned the cow as long as they could milk it.
68 Discussion

This last statement reflects the familiar misconception, namely that
wealth is extracted not created. The Chinese on Malaya had created their
wealth; they didn’t take it from the Malays. But the saying also embodies
the important truth, namely that when a country is relatively lightly governed, people are not so desperately anxious who has the government. The
Chinese in today’s Malaysia would not say that they did not mind who
had the government. We should remember this vital distinction between
elected government or non-elected government on the one hand and limited and unlimited government on the other.
Second, I think Gordon reminded us of a very important consideration
which we are apt to overlook, namely that much of the world’s greatest art
was created in autocracies of various kinds.
There is an asymmetry between the size of the public sector and government control of the economy. A large public sector implies government
control over much of the economy. But the converse doesn’t apply. Even
if public spending is small, the government can still control the economy
closely by licensing, ethnic quotas, price and wage regulation and the like.
The last point is the question of how fundamental is freedom of speech
or freedom of expression of ideas. Academics habitually insist on the freedom of ideas and their expression. Simultaneously they often insist on the
need for government control of the production and distribution of other
goods and services. Some years ago Coase published a very informative
article on this dichotomy titled “The Market for Goods and the Market for
Ideas.”
Brian Kantor I wouldn’t want to abandon the links between economic
and political freedoms. I come from a country where democracy, that is,
political freedoms, are greatly feared because of the economic outcomes
that are expected from it. In other words, the popular government is feared
because of the great power that government would have and exercise.
There is thus a violent competition to control economic outcomes through
government. Clearly, unless you can get people to agree to limit those
powers, you won’t get democracy, political freedoms or civil freedoms either. So, I think the links are extremely important, although some of the
evidence, as Gordon has pointed out, seems rather unclear.
I suggest trying to save the hypothesis that there are these links between
economic and political freedom by looking at the realities again, and governments may be very important in that their share of the economy may be
very large, especially if the amount of transfer payments they indulge in
are included. Yet, despite this, the economic outcomes may not be terribly
much affected by it. For example, you may have a very high level of taxation, but when you look at the benefits of government expenditure, how
Discussion 69
copyright The Fraser Institute
are they distributed? Aren’t the people who proportionately pay much of
the taxation, in fact, actually getting a lot of the benefits? We know that
educational expenditure goes largely to the middle class. So, the reality is
rather different than what it may appear as. That is, even though governments are big, maybe they don’t affect the economic outcomes very much,
especially when people are free to move their capital and are free to migrate.
Douglass North I guess I am going to be supporting Gordon a lot. This
goes against my grain, but, truth will out.
I do think there is confusion, as I hear it around the table, about really
what you mean by institutions and freedoms or the outcome of institutions,
which is part of what we are talking about. It seems to me what we are always interested in is not the institutions per se; we are interested in the
outcomes. That is, we are interested in the set of choices that follow from
this. One of the things that I have been at pains over the years in learning
about institutions is that it isn’t just rules, it isn’t just enforcement characteristics, it is also this illusive thing that I call “norms of behaviour.”
Restraints on behaviour by individuals in society really exist, and they
exist above and beyond rules and enforcement characteristics. We don’t
know a lot about them, but they make a lot of difference in the outcomes
we get. That means that the same rules imposed on different societies produce very different results. What would be a rule that would deny
freedoms in one society wouldn’t be exercised in that way at all in another
society.
I remember, Alan, when we had that conference on immigration that
you gave a paper at, and I commented on. A critical question at this conference was this bill that was before Congress which was going to have
everybody having an identification card, and it was immediately raised,
and properly so, that this sounded like the Soviet Union. In fact, what you
would be having was people being done the same way. But it is not clear
that in the United States it would produce that result at all, or that in a lot
of other countries it would produce that result. You cannot make simple,
facile statements in which you shift and talk about the consequences of a
rule in one place and another place without thinking about the fact that
they are also constrained both by enforcement characteristics and the
norms of behaviour in different societies.
Raymond Gastil The discussion has gone in many different directions
since I originally raised my hand, but let me make a few points on what
has been going on. The first point is that very clear majorities can be very
coercive, and what they do may ruin society. For example, one man one
70 Discussion
copyright The Fraser Institute
vote could ruin South Africa, no doubt about it. Nevertheless, in most situations there is very little alternative, (1), to having governments and, (2), if
you accept certain principles about equality, to having majority rule, in
spite of some of the results that may accrue from that.
It seems to me that majority government, as oppressive, coercive, and
so on as it may be and in spite of all the theory that one might have that
unanimity or something else is a possibility or would be nicer, is really for
most situations the only available solution to the problem of power. From
that perspective, I find the remarks by Walter, for example, reminiscent
more than anything of listening to Marx speak about the terrible things
that were going on in the world. It is utopianism to say that something that
has never been anywhere on any scale—and probably because of the nature of people will not be anywhere on any scale—is the way in which we
should organize our relationships.
The second point is just a thought in regard to Tibor’s point that only
individuals really have ends. That may be true in some philosophical
sense, nevertheless, in a practical sense, if we think about the fact that we
as Americans are very interested in the survival of certain values over the
future centuries that stretch out in front of us, it isn’t as appropriate to
think of those in terms of our individual wants and desires as to think of
those in terms of group wants and desires. I don’t think it is we as separate
individuals that are really interested in that long-range future, but we as
members of a collectivity.
The point that I was really going to talk about when I raised my hand
was Assar’s point having to do with the media. Let me just point to National Public Radio in the United States, which is the closest thing to a
government-owned and controlled media we have in this country, and yet
is the most consistently critical of the United States government.
Voice Republican government!
Ramon Diaz Assar Lindbeck said that he didn’t find it difficult to think
of a regime where all property was social and yet political and civil liberties remained. I think that is perfectly right, as a logical point of view. If
we think of society as made up of so many chessmen, we can arrange
them in a logical way in that sense. But I doubt that this is a very relevant
statement.
Actually, what we are talking about here has to do with the rule of law
and with competitive capitalism, and this is a very unique circumstance.
As the Friedmans say in their paper, the typical state of mankind is tyranny, servitude and misery. We are in a very, very special circumstance. I
Discussion 71
copyright The Fraser Institute
think it is inconceivable that we could have come to this special and privileged historical circumstance if the society had been made up of civil
servants. Civil servants will not produce a society that upholds freedom.
We have a character in this great play that is enacted in Western society,
and this hero of our play is a property owner. Therefore, I think that we
have to focus on the very special characteristics that have prevailed in the
West which have produced a particular individual who thinks of himself as
a separate private individual with property rights and not as an employee
of the government.
Michael Parkin I would like to go back to the sentence that begins the
thesis of this chapter and which several people have picked up on. It
seems to me that if we think about what is being said there in just a
slightly different way from the precise words that are used, we see that the
statement really has a lot of strength. Milton and Rose distinguish between
socialism and capitalism, but they always—or almost always (as Milton
has said)—qualify the word “capitalism” with the word “competitive.” It
seems to me to be useful to think about a two-fold classification—competitive and noncompetitive arrangements; and capitalistic and socialistic
arrangements—and then ask ourselves, which is the key dimension?
We know that scarcity means that every situation has to be fundamentally competitive, but using the word in the more limited sense, to talk
about how we explicitly organize our social institutions, I wonder whether
it is the competitive rather than the socialist/capitalist dimension that
makes the difference? Think about competitive as being a situation in
which there is freedom of entry and exit. That is what makes competition
different from other arrangements. There might be only one (producer,
government or whatever), but the fact that that one got there through a
process that could have resulted in any one, or more than one, being there,
doing whatever it is, makes the situation different from a situation in
which there is one and only one there because others are excluded by explicit rules and procedures.
If we think of things in this way, I think we see that Assar is wrong in
the inferences he draws from Sweden. Sweden is an example of competitive socialism. It is competitive in the sense that it competes on the world
market to sell its output. We wouldn’t want to say that IBM is in some
sense a socialist country, but Sweden is a big organization, a big corporation, like IBM, that produces goods and services by means that do not use
the market very extensively, internally, but that sell the output competitively on the world market.
72 Discussion

I don’t know the fraction of Swedish GNP that is traded internationally,
but it must be pretty high. That puts a discipline on the Swedish economy
that would not be there if this were a closed economic system.
Secondly, a feature of the freedom of entry and exit view was touched
on by Brian Kantor, that is, individuals who don’t want to put up with the
arrangements that are in place in Sweden are, in fact, pretty reasonably
free to take their human and physical capital and locate it somewhere else.
That also makes it a competitive environment in the same sense as before.
I will summarize very quickly just by saying that if we think about the
words “competitive” and “noncompetitive” as being more important for
this particular point than the words “socialist” and “capitalist,” we make
more sense of the original thesis and it emerges as a much more powerful
thesis.
Svetozar Pejovich I have three points. The absence of private ownership
is what I understand to be socialism. In that sense, Sweden is not a socialist state and, in that sense, Hungary is. If I have a car that belongs to the
state, I cannot sell it. And for that reason there is no market for capital
goods.
On the second point, I want to ask Mr. Friedman. What I observe is that
people trade freedom for other things, like security, marriage, the priesthood, and if this is so, then there must be diminishing marginal returns to
the freedom that people enjoy. If so, then a perfectly free society will be
an inefficient society. To me, what is important seems to be the ease of
exit, the cost of exit.
Assar Lindbeck I think we all agree that there are very important links
between political and economic systems. We are trying to discover the
character of those links. What I tried to say is that those links are much
more complex than earlier thought by Hayek and the Friedmans in their
expositions. Moreover, they are not deterministic, but they are highly
probabilistic. I think Milton should include chance and risk in these considerations as well.
There is not a monotonic relation between the size of the public sector
and individual freedom. If you go to a society where public ownership is
10 percent and increase it to 40, 50, 60 or 70 percent, you could not predict what would happen to civil liberties in that society. If public spending
increased to 65 percent of GNP in Sweden, I couldn’t say that there are
fewer civil liberties now than when the sector was 20 percent or in countries where it is presently 20 percent.
Discussion 73
copyright The Fraser Institute
As the size of the public sector grows, freedom of choice—the possibility for an individual to change his own life situation by his own
effort—decreases. But I think that is very different from civil liberties. By
civil liberties I mean that you have elections, you have freedom of speech,
you have a competitive political system—you can feel free to criticize the
government as much as you like. That is different from the fact that it is
difficult to change your own disposable income by your own effort. I am
not saying that the latter is less important, only that it is different. We
should make distinctions between those different aspects of freedom—freedom of choice versus civil liberties.
Lastly, in Sweden there is no big risk in criticizing the government,
with some exceptions. Research institutes, for instance, that live on government funds, might think for awhile before they criticize government.
There could be some limitations there. What is more important is that people hesitate much more to criticize labour unions, because labour unions
can influence the career of a person in the sense of affecting promotions.
Labour unions do not have a truly competitive political system for choosing their leaders. You can get a new government after two or three years,
but it is very difficult to get a new political party to rule the labour union.
That is ruled by the same group of people decade after decade. So there is
a private organization besides the state which I think is much more detrimental to freedom of speech in my country than is the government
because of the lack of a competitive political system between the unions.
Finally, it is very misleading to call Sweden a socialist state. I think 7
percent of manufacturing is owned by the government—less than in practically any country in the world. It is a transfer state rather than a socialist
state.
Gordon Tullock I think we have three different things: economic freedom, which is the right to work, et cetera; civil freedom or personal
freedom, which is a large collection of things which, really on traditional
grounds we think are important, like the right to speak, and so forth; and
then finally there is the use of the voting system in some variant. I spend
most of my time trying to think of ways to make it work better, so I say
“some variant.” I agree with Block, that the use of freedom for the third
kind of freedoms is a somewhat odd use of language. It doesn’t follow
from that that I don’t think it is important. I do think it is important, but I
don’t think, strictly speaking, that freedom is the correct term to use with
it.
If you go back to the 19th century you will find the opposite of what I
am calling here the Friedman/Hayek position. You find people saying that
if you want a free economy you have to have democracy. This point of
74 Discussion
copyright The Fraser Institute
view vanished in the 1920s and ‘30s for rather obvious reasons. There has
been an effort to simply reverse it. I don’t see any strong reasoning for doing so. In fact, in the 19th century I think it was essentially an accidental
coincidence that economic freedom and democracy coexisted. I also think
it is essentially an accidental coincidence now.
We can be in favour of all of these freedoms without feeling that we
have to allege that they come out of each other. Some of the personal freedoms come out of the use of some kind of voting system, because you
can’t do it unless you have freedom of speech and things like that. That is
part of the voting system. But other than that, they seem to be three different things—all of which are desirable—and I don’t see any strong reason
for arguing that they are correlated.
Alan Walters I think the sort of distinction which Milton makes in his
book somewhere between totalitarianism and despotism is a very important one. Hong Kong is ruled by a despot, by the governor, but it is
completely opposite to a totalitarian society. I think that distinction tends
to be lost sometimes.
I would like to go back and support a point that Gordon made in a positive sense, and that is, it isn’t just that great art comes from these despots.
It is also true that those despots, to a very large extent, had competitive art
systems supplying them.
The second point I think is very important too. For all of their many
successes, America and Britain in their capitalist heydays have been pretty
much an artistic desert. It is tragic and it is something we cannot easily explain. There is no good art, no good music produced during these long
periods.
Raymond Gastil I made most of my points before, but let me just add
that there is a great difference between different contexts as to what are
the important and significant issues of freedom. As you move from capitalist to socialist, from government control to private control and so forth,
you have different problems arising. One thing that we have not spent
enough time on is that if you don’t have government controls that limit
freedom, you very often find that the controls come from other sources.
They might come from unions, from religion, or from business.
Walter Block Gordon agrees with me that we should put economic and
civil liberties on the one side and political freedom on the other, and even
that political freedom is sort of a misnomer. But he insists that it is important, nonetheless. I would urge that it is not quite so important. Certainly the Hong Kong example of the despotism not ruining economic liberty is
one example. Another example would be British colonial rule over Africa
and India, which was despotic in many ways but which was very beneficial in terms of economics.
Second, I don’t regard unions as private enterprises. I regard them as
bits of government or “overmighty subjects,” as Peter has called them. I
regard them as bands of criminals who compete with the government
gangs. Somehow they have wrested some legitimacy and some ability to
initiate coercion from the government. But, just like government, they do
provide some legitimate services. So they are neither fish nor fowl. But to
call them private institutions is a misnomer.
Third, about Sweden being like IBM. I am very reluctant to accept this
analogy. I see a vast difference between a voluntary organization such as
IBM, which receives its capital from the voluntary choices of investors,
and Sweden, which obtains its revenue from the involuntary taxation system.
My last point is with regard to utopians. I accept happily the notion that
I am a utopian, if, by utopian you mean all that is good and pure! And I
do mean it just that way, at least in one sense: a utopian is someone who
does not care much whether something is or is not politically feasible. A
utopian says what is right and what is not right is much more important
than what is politically feasible. Certainly, a free enterprise system now is
not really politically feasible, but I think that is really unimportant. My
concerns are for what is right and just and not for what is likely to occur
in the next couple of years.
Milton Friedman There are so many things here I don’t know quite what
to react to. But I want to start by making a few comments in connection
with Assar Lindbeck’s various comments.
I believe that Assar neglected to read the whole of the sentence which
he criticized, because it says, “A society which is socialist cannot also be
democratic, in the sense of guaranteeing individual freedom” (italics
added). And the next sentence goes on, “Economic arrangements play a
dual role...On the one hand, freedom in economic arrangements is itself a
component of freedom broadly understood.” So when Assar says that socialism is not compatible with freedom of choice, he is agreeing with us
that it is not possible to have a democratic socialism which guarantees individual freedom. Because in our view economic choice is an extremely
important component of economic freedom, and not simply a means toward another end.

I agree thoroughly with Ingemar that government spending as a fraction
of income is an imperfect measure of the role of government and is not
necessarily closely related to most of the other things that we talk about.
But government influence, in the sense of controlling the activities of individuals, including redistribution of income, does severely interfere with
freedom of individuals as such. Therefore, I am not going to retreat from
believing that that sentence is basically a correct sentence.
I also will agree with him, and with Michael, that what is really relevant
is pluralism and competitiveness, and that is why in an earlier page on this
little document we got out we said that “The second broad principle is that
government power must be dispersed...If I do not like what my local community does...I can move to another local community.” I have no doubt
that a world of small, dispersed governments—even if governments in that
case owned all the means of production—could be, in principle, competitive as among the different governments and could, in principle, produce
exactly the same results as what we call a free enterprise, private enterprise, situation.
With respect to Raymond’s various comments, I want to separate myself completely from the notion of group values. Again, if I may just go
back to show that I am not making this up anew. If we say, he—and by
that I mean a liberal in my sense of the term liberal—“recognizes no national goal except as it is the consensus of the goals that the citizens
severally serve.” I believe there are such things, very important things, as
consensus about values, agreement about values, but I think the notion of
group values is a dangerous notion that inevitably leads to an organismic
concept of society and in a direction I don’t think Raymond would want to
go.
As to some of the other comments, I will make one more comment
only. I have no doubt that the best of all forms of government is benevolent dictatorship. I am not going to quarrel with that at all, and we have
had some examples in history of good, benevolent dictatorships, as in
Hong Kong, in Singapore with Lee Kuan Yew—he’s been a benevolent
dictator. The problem with benevolent dictators is that they don’t stay benevolent, which goes to Herbert’s point of what is the time period. They don’t stay benevolent, and they tend to be replaced by people who aren’t
so benevolent, and the benevolent people tend to get corrupted as well.
On to Gordon’s point about the notions contained in Hayek’s Road to
Serfdom and our Capitalism and Freedom. The key feature of Hayek’s
Road to Serfdom, as I see it, is the chapter which says the worst rise to the
top. In that respect I believe that he has been completely right. I don’t believe you can say he has been wrong. He was wrong in predicting that the
increase in the size of government measured by government spending would lead to dictatorship and totalitarianism, but what happened in the
course of the next 20 years is that the character of government expenditures and control changed. It started out in the direction of nationalization
and then it changed into redistribution. And there is no doubt that—and
this is a point Assar has been making—the effect on the tendency toward
dictatorship is quite different as between these two modes of government
expenditure.

Douglass North I want to pick up on Milton’s point about competitiveness. Actually, it relates to something Michael said earlier. It seems to me
that what is crucial about competitiveness is two aspects of it that make
institutions have greater viability. One is that competition maximizes the
chance to make mistakes and, therefore, perhaps the chance of finding successful ways to do things. Since we don’t know which ways work, we
want to maximize those opportunities. Certainly, the kind of institutions
that do that are very crucial.

Secondly, competitiveness eliminates the losers, and that is equally important. If you let the losers continue and persist in the society, then you
build into it structural weaknesses. I have a term that is not original,
“adaptive efficiency,” which is very different I think from allocative efficiency as we use it in economics. But it is related to institutions that do
maximize both the choice set that is available to people and the competitiveness, so that you wipe out losing sets of institutions.
The Northwest Ordinance, which I talk about in my paper, is a marvellous illustration of it. It provided for some very simple things like fee
simple ownership of land, easy transferability of title, inheritance laws that
were clear and simple. The result was that while downstream in U.S. history we made terrible ways of distributing land, it didn’t make much
difference because with these institutions in place we could transfer land,
as we did, to more efficient uses and ones that solved our problems better.
So the competitiveness is something that has a precise meaning in the way
I want to think about it that relates to your point and to Milton’s.
Arnold Harberger As I have been listening through the discussion this
morning and also from the very beginning, looking at the title of the conference, I felt that this was a topic that could easily fall prey to semantics
and definitions, to creating categories and arguing between them. Now,
there is nothing wrong with all of that, but I think we should recognize,
for the efficiency of our discussion, that it is a trap that we could easily
fall into.
I would like to try to help the discussion get a bit more concrete by
speaking a little from my own experience. I float around in Latin America a lot, and I also try to study economic growth around the world a fair
amount. There is a question that really gets me sometimes, especially in
ideological discussions in Latin America. They keep pounding me. They
say, in effect, that the kind of economics I am selling is okay, but it is
only dictatorial, autocratic governments that can really do it.
It has been bothersome to me to have to agree with this view to some
extent. The problem is that we all like all the freedoms. If we only liked
one, it would be easy. I look at the actual historical record of Hong Kong,
Singapore, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Spain in the latter decade of Franco,
Portugal, Brazil, in each case, its economic miracle took place under an
autocratic government. Chile has had two spates (of which it is currently
in one) where it has outperformed its neighbours, largely as a consequence
of this type of policy. While not many seem to be aware of the fact, Guatemala and Nicaragua, starting around 1950, had very good growth under
autocratic government. The reality is that these governments have had
better than average economic performance under that kind of rule.
My first response is, we are economists, we know that other freedoms
are a part of our value system; we have to be willing to pay a price. And
that is really where I sit when I have to. But at the same time I wonder
what is the secret there? Why are these essentially autocratic regimes
seemingly more successful than other regimes?
First of all, let me note that most of these autocracies seem to turn into
technocracies. They tend to acquire a higher proportion of technocrats, and
this transition seems in some way to be important for the growth process.
The reason appears to be that the technocracy in turn imposes a discipline
and self-restraint on government. It keeps government small when a lot of
populist and other pressures are trying to make it bigger. Autocratic government seems to be able to impose self-restraint and to avoid doing a lot
of things that it would be pressured to do in a more open political system.
Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, autocratic governments often
bring discipline, restraint and predictability to the economic scene, which
before had been chaotic. It is this transition that is the common thread in
these various success stories.
But, I can also think of three cases of democratic governments which
have been successful in the growth encouraging game—Switzerland, Japan, and Panama. Switzerland is an old democracy but very self-restrictive
by the nature of its constitution; nothing can happen in Switzerland,
hardly. Japan in the modern world is a democracy, but they have a lot of
built-in self-restraint by their culture. Panama had built-in restraint by having the dollar as a circulating medium and having a prohibition against
having a central bank. But during the 1960s, when it led the Western
Hemisphere in the rate of growth, it didn’t have the tendency to populism that later infected and ultimately overwhelmed it in the late 1970s and
early 1980s.
So, here are three cases where democracy has worked to produce high
rates of growth, in all of which the elements of discipline and restraint,
and in a certain sense predictability, have been present.
Raymond Gastil I think insofar as that is true, I would have some questions about the democracies in each case, and particularly in the case of
Panama. But perhaps we don’t wish to get into that at the moment.
Alvin Rabushka First of all, I don’t have a dictionary with me, but I
think the word “despotic” conveys some norms and modes of behaviour.
Hong Kong is not despotic; please stop calling it despotic. Call it regulated, call it night watchman, call it authoritarian, call it unrepresentative,
call it administrative no-party state, but stop calling it despotic.
The second thing is precisely the point that Arnold was making—this
notion about semantics and language and what these words mean. Words
have meanings, and we have to talk about them in some way or we can’t
talk about the subject. I think we all have a sense about what civil liberties
are, and I’d buy the Freedom House list intact. I think we have some
pretty good senses of what economic freedoms are, and in my own paper I
basically enumerate the Friedman bill of rights and add three or four more,
which I think he might be willing to buy as well. So I think we can get
around that.
Now we get to the political problem, and Block is right. But I think we
can amend that a little bit. The way I would like to talk about it is to talk
about political freedoms having imbedded within them, shall we say, some
kind of constitutional, written or unwritten custom limitations on the abilities of those majorities to take away the rights of individuals and
minorities. If we can do something like that, I think we would get a better
handle on what we mean by political freedom that won’t bother us all that
much.

But the last point is this whole question of running around the world
looking at other countries, and Latin America is one of the few places I
haven’t gone to look at. One thing I did do at a prior Liberty Fund Symposium and in some other papers was take a hundred countries in the
developing world in the post-war period and then take the Freedom House
data and look at their scores on civil liberties and look at their scores on
political rights, and I discovered the following.

First of all, civil liberties and political freedoms come out reasonably
similar when you simply do a cross classification against some economic
factors (I will tell you what those are in a minute), which means there is a
very high internal overlap between the presence of political rights and civil
liberties as measured in the Freedom House scores. And that is very encouraging. It means that if you are going to have political rights, you can
have civil liberties, and vice versa. You don’t have to choose one over the
other. So you don’t have to worry about the majorities tyrannizing civil
liberties out of existence.

Now, in terms of what these economic variables were, I used two: one
was per capita income, and the other was rates of growth over the last 20
years, that is, per capita rates of growth in income. The results come out
reasonably the same; that is, countries that have had very high rates of
economic growth for 20 years now have a reasonably high per capita income. Countries that have had very low growth rates don’t. The results
came out reasonably similar, and they are as follows.

Where there is zero or low growth—I mean negative growth up to 1 or
2 percent—and per capita incomes are $400 and under, there are almost no
civil liberties and political rights. In countries that have high rates of economic growth and per capita incomes over a thousand, or seven hundred
and up, there is a fifty-fifty mix, between countries that have high civil
liberties and not and countries that have high political rights and not. So
stagnation and poverty are just iron-clad guarantees of not having any
freedoms. Prosperity gives you some chance of getting some of the liberties.
In this context, I think what Arnold has described as a cross-sectional
phenomenon also is exhibited longitudinally. What is clearly happening in
Taiwan and in Korea—for that matter, mainland China and some other
places—is there is a gradual emerging of civil liberties and political rights
that didn’t exist in the first instance. So affluence is a kind of nice breeding ground in many of these countries for a much looser society, a much
less restricted, a much less controlled society. On the basis of the evidence, I am willing to go on the line and simply say that if one can
impose the kinds of growth-oriented policies that work, one will
get—down the road a generation later, in those places where it has had a
chance to work—probably many more rights and freedoms than there were
in the beginning or than there are in other countries which are similar except for the growth experience.
Gordon Tullock I would deduce from these numbers that you have given
that a country that has a per capita income of about $150 a year could
never have freedom. I am, of course, referring to the United States in

1776. But going on from that, actually what I wanted to talk about is that
we observe that a dictatorship sometimes is successful economically and
democracy sometimes is successful economically. As a result of the fact
that a lot of democracies in the great 19th century were leading countries,
both in economy and politics, a lot of them are still pretty wealthy. I am
sure that is the reason the United States is still pretty wealthy. Although
we had the advantage that the 19th century, in our case, lasted right
through to the 1930s. So we left the 19th century somewhat later than anyone else.
There is another possible explanatory variable, an unpopular one.
Again, this is found in pre-World War II or even pre-World War I literature. The anthropologists divide the European culture up into 3 main groups, by language, actually: Slavic, Latin and Teutonic. There is an
overwhelming correlation between being members of that Teutonic group
and being both prosperous and democratic, and also, I should say, being
protestant. It may be that we are simply talking about a characteristic of
one particular subculture within the European collection. I sincerely hope
not.
