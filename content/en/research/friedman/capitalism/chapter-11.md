The humanitarian and egalitarian sentiment which helped produce the steeply graduated individual income tax has also produced a host of other measures directed at promoting the ''welfare" of particular groups. The most important single set of measures is the bundle misleadingly labeled "social security." Others are public housing, minimum wage laws, farm price supports, medical care for particular groups, special aid programs, and so on.

I shall first discuss briefly a few of the latter, mostly to indicate how
different their actual effects may be from those intended, and shall then discuss
at somewhat greater length the largest single component of the social security
program, old age and survivor's insurance.
Miscellaneous Welfare Measures

1. Public Housing 

One argument frequently made for public housing is based on an alleged neighborhood effect: slums and low quality housing impose higher costs on the community as fire and police protection. 

This argues for higher taxes on the poor in order to equalize private and social cost.

<!--  the kind of housing that adds to social costs
since this would tend  -->

But this is undesirable.

And so people propose public housing as a means of helping low-income people. 

<!-- If this be the case, why subsidize housing in particular?  -->

<!-- If funds are to be used to help the poor, would they not be used more effectively by being given in cash rather than in kind?  -->

It is better to give cash to poor families than actual housing. 

<!-- Surely, the families being helped would rather have" a given sum in cash than in the form of housing.  -->

They could themselves spend the money on housing if they wanted. 

<!-- Hence, they would never be worse off if given cash; if they regarded other needs as more
important, they would be better off.  -->

The cash subsidy would solve:
- the congestion
- the need to help the poor

<!--  the neighborhood effect as well as the subsidy in kind, since if it were not used to
buy housing it would be available to pay extra taxes justified by the
neighborhood effect. -->

Public housing cannot therefore be justified by either:
- neighborhood effects or
- helping poor families

Its justification is only on grounds of paternalism -- families being helped "need" housing more than they "need" other things but would themselves either not agree or would spend the money unwisely. 

The liberal will be inclined to reject this argument for responsible adults. 

He cannot completely reject it in the more indirect form in
which it affects children; namely, that parents will neglect the welfare of the
children, who ''need" the better housing. But he will surely demand evidence
much more persuasive and to the point than the kind usually given before he can
accept this final argument as adequate justification for large expenditures on
public housing.

 So much could have been said in the abstract, in advance of actual
experience with public housing. Now that we have had experience, we can go
much farther. In practice, public housing has turned out to have effects very
different indeed from those intended.

 Far from improving the housing of the poor, as its proponents expected,
public housing has done just the reverse. The number of dwelling units
destroyed in the course of erecting public housing projects has been far larger
than the number of new dwelling units constructed. But public housing as such
has done nothing to reduce the number of persons to be housed. The effect of
public housing has therefore been to raise the number of persons per dwelling
unit. Some families have probably been better housed than they would otherwise
have been those who were fortunate enough to get occupancy of the publicly
built units. But this has only made the problem for the rest all the worse, since
the average density of all together went up.

 Of course, private enterprise offset some of the deleterious effect of the
public housing program by conversion of existing quarters and construction of
new ones for either the persons directly displaced or, more generally, the
persons displaced at one or two removes in the game of musical chairs set in
motion by the public housing projects. However, these private resources would
have been available in the absence of the public housing program.

 Why did the public housing program have this effect? For the general
reason we have stressed time and again. The general interest that motivated
many to favor instituting the program is diffuse and transitory. Once the program
was adopted, it was bound to be dominated by the special interests that it could
serve. 

In this case, the special interests were those local groups that were
anxious to have blighted areas cleared and refurbished, either because they
owned property there or because the blight was threatening local or central
business districts. 

Public housing served as a convenient means to accomplish
their objective, which required more destruction than construction.
 Even so, "urban blight" is still with us in undiminished force, to judge by
the growing pressure for federal funds to deal with it.
 
Another gain its proponents expected from public housing was the reduction of juvenile delinquency by improving housing conditions. Here again, the program in many instances had precisely the opposite effect, entirely aside from its failure to improve average housing conditions. 

The income limitations quite properly imposed for the occupancy of public housing at subsidized rentals have led to a very high density of "broken" families in particular, divorced or widowed mothers with children. Children of broken families are especially likely to be "problem" children and a high concentration of such children is likely to increase juvenile delinquency. 

One manifestation has been the very adverse effect on schools in the neighborhood of a public housing project. Whereas a school can readily absorb a few "problem" children it is very difficult for it to absorb a large number. Yet in some cases, broken families are a third or more of the total in a public housing project and the project may account for a majority of the children in the school. Had these families been assisted through cash grants, they would have been spread much more thinly through the community.
