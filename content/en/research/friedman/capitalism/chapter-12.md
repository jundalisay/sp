The extraordinary economic growth experienced by Western countries during the past two centuries and the wide distribution of the benefits of free enterprise have enormously reduced the extent of poverty in any absolute sense in the capitalistic countries of the West. But poverty is in part a relative matter, and even in these countries, there are clearly many people living under conditions that the rest of us label as poverty.

One recourse, and in many ways the most desirable, is private charity. It is noteworthy that the heyday of laissez-faire, the middle and late nineteenth century in Britain and the United States, saw an extraordinary proliferation of private eleemosynary organizations and institutions. One of the major costs of the extension of governmental welfare activities has been the corresponding decline in private charitable activities.

 It can be argued that private charity is insufficient because the benefits
from it accrue to people other than those who make the giftsagain, a
neighborhood effect. I am distressed by the sight of poverty; I am benefited by
its alleviation; but I am benefited equally whether I or someone else pays for its
alleviation; the benefits of other people's charity therefore partly accrue to me.
To put it differently, we might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of
poverty, provided everyone else did. We might not be willing to contribute the
same amount without such assurance. In small communities, public pressure can
suffice to realize the proviso even with private charity. In the large impersonal
communities that are increasingly coming to dominate our society, it is much
more difficult for it to do so.

 Suppose one accepts, as I do, this line of reasoning as justifying
governmental action to alleviate poverty; to set, as it were, a floor under the
standard of life of every person in the community. There remain the questions,
how much and how. I see no way of deciding ''how much" except in terms of the
amount of taxes weby which I mean the great bulk of usare willing to impose on
ourselves for the purpose. The question, "how," affords more room for
speculation.

 Two things seem clear. First, if the objective is to alleviate poverty, we
should have a program directed at helping the poor. There is every reason to
help the poor man who happens to be a farmer, not because he is a farmer but
because he is poor. The program, that is, should be designed to help people as
people not as members of particular occupational groups or age groups or wagerate groups or labor organizations or industries. This is a defect of farm
programs, general old-age benefits, minimum-wage laws, pro-union legislation, 
158
tariffs, licensing provisions of crafts or professions, and so on in seemingly
endless profusion. Second, so far as possible the program should, while
operating through the market, not distort the market or impede its functioning.
This is a defect of price supports, minimum-wage laws, tariffs and the like.

 The arrangement that recommends itself on purely mechanical grounds is
a negative income tax. We now have an exemption of $ 600 per person under
the federal income tax (plus a minimum 10 per cent flat deduction). If an
individual receives $ 100 taxable income, i.e., an income of $ 100 in excess of
the exemption and deductions, he pays a tax. Under the proposal, if his taxable
income minus $ 100, i.e., $ 100 less than the exemption plus deductions, he
would pay a negative tax, i.e., receive a subsidy. If the rate of subsidy were, say,
50 per cent, he would receive $ 50. If he had no income at all, and, for
simplicity, no deductions, and the rate were constant, he would receive $ 300.
He might receive more than this if he had deductions, for example, for medical
expenses, so that his income less deductions, was negative even before
subtracting the exemption. The rates of subsidy could, of course, be graduated
just as the rates of tax above the exemption are. In this way, it would be
possible to set a floor below which no man's net income (defined now to include
the subsidy) could fallin the simple example $ 300 per person. The precise floor
set would depend on what the community could afford.

 The advantages of this arrangement are clear. It is directed specifically at
the problem of poverty. It gives help in the form most useful to the individual,
namely, cash. It is general and could be substituted for the host of special
measures now in effect. It makes explicit the cost borne by society. It operates
outside the market. Like any other measures to alleviate poverty, it reduces the
incentives of those helped to help themselves, but it does not eliminate that
incentive entirely, as a system of supplementing incomes up to some fixed
minimum would. An extra dollar earned always means more money available for
expenditure.

 No doubt there would be problems of administration, but these seem to
me a minor disadvantage, if they be a disadvantage at all. The system would fit
directly into our current income tax system and could be administered along with
it. The present tax system covers the bulk of income recipients and the necessity
of covering all would have the by-product of improving the operation of the
present income tax. More important, if enacted as a substitute for the present
rag bag of measures directed at the same end, the total administrative burden
would surely be reduced.

 A few brief calculations suggest also that this proposal could be far less
costly in money, let alone in the degree of governmental intervention involved,
than our present collection of welfare measures. Alternatively, these calculations 
159
can be regarded as showing how wasteful our present measures are, judged as
measures for helping the poor.

 In 1961, government amounted to something like $ 33 billion (federal,
state, and local) on direct welfare payments and programs of all kinds: old age
assistance, social security benefit payments, aid to dependent children, general
assistance, farm price support programs, public housing, etc.1 I have excluded
veterans' benefits in making this calculation. I have also made no allowance for
the direct and indirect costs of such measures as minimum-wage laws, tariffs,
licensing provisions, and so on, or for the costs of public health activities, state
and local expenditures on hospitals, mental institutions, and the like.

 There are approximately 57 million consumer units (unattached individuals
and families) in the United States. The 1961 expenditures of $ 33 billion would
have financed outright cash grants of nearly $ 6,000 per consumer unit to the 10
per cent with the lowest incomes. Such grants would have raised their incomes
above the average for all units in the United States. Alternatively, these
expenditures would have financed grants of nearly $ 3,000 per consumer unit to
the 20 per cent with the lowest incomes. Even if one went so far as that onethird whom New Dealers were fond of calling ill-fed, ill-housed, and illclothed,


1961 expenditures would have financed grants of nearly $ 2,000 per consumer
unit, roughly the sum which, after allowing for the change in the level of prices,
was the income which separated the lower one-third in the middle 1930's from
the upper two-thirds. Today, fewer than one-eighth of consumer units have an
income, adjusted for the change in the level of prices, as low as that of the
lowest third in the middle 1930's.

 Clearly, these are all far more extravagant programs than can be justified
to "alleviate poverty" even by a rather generous interpretation of that term. A
program which supplemented the incomes of the 20 per cent of the consumer
units with the lowest incomes so as to raise them to the lowest income of the
rest would cost less than half of what we are now spending.

 The major disadvantage of the proposed negative income tax is its
political implications. It establishes a system under which taxes are imposed on
some to pay subsidies to others. And presumably, these others have a vote.
There is always the danger that instead of being an arrangement under which
the great majority tax themselves willingly to help an unfortunate minority, it will
be converted into one under which a majority imposes taxes for its own benefit
on an unwilling minority. Because this proposal makes the process so explicit,
the danger is perhaps greater than with other measures. I see no solution to this
problem except to rely on the self-restraint and good will of the electorate.

 Writing about a corresponding problem British old-age pensions in 1914,
Dicey said, "Surely a sensible and a benevolent man may well ask himself
whether England as a whole will gain by enacting that the receipt of poor relief,
in the shape of a pension, shall be consistent with the pensioner's retaining the
right to join in the election of a Member of Parliament."2


 The verdict of experience in Britain on Dicey's question must as yet be
regarded as mixed. England did move to universal suffrage without the
disfranchisement of either pensioners or other recipients of state aid. And there
has been an enormous expansion of taxation of some for the benefit of others,
which must surely be regarded as having retarded Britain's growth, and so may
not even have benefited most of those who regard themselves as on the
receiving end. But these measures have not destroyed, at least as yet, Britain's
liberties or its predominantly capitalistic system. And, more important, there have
been some signs of a turning of the tide and of the exercise of self-restraint on
the part of the electorate.

Liberalism and Egalitamanism

 The heart of the liberal philosophy is a belief in the dignity of the
individual, in his freedom to make the most of his capacities and opportunities
according to his own lights, subject only to the proviso that he not interfere with
the freedom of other individuals to do the same. This implies a belief in the
equality of men in one sense; in their inequality in another. Each man has an
equal right to freedom. This is an important and fundamental right precisely
because men are different, because one man will want to do different things with
his freedom than another, and in the process can contribute more than another
to the general culture of the society in which many men live.

 The liberal will therefore distinguish sharply between equality of rights and
equality of opportunity, on the one hand, and material equality or equality of
outcome on the other. He may welcome the fact that a free society in fact tends
toward greater material equality than any other yet tried. But he will regard this
as a desirable by-product of a free society, not its major justification. He will
welcome measures that promote both freedom and equalitysuch as measures to
eliminate monopoly power and to improve the operation of the market. 

He will
regard private charity directed at helping the less fortunate as an example of the
proper use of freedom. And he may approve state action toward ameliorating
poverty as a more effective way in which the great bulk of the community can
achieve a common objective. He will do so with regret, however, at having to
substitute compulsory for voluntary action.

The egalitarian will go this far, too. But he will want to go further. He will
defend taking from some to give to others, not as a more effective means  whereby the "some" can achieve an objective they want to achieve, but on grounds of "justice." At this point, equality comes sharply into conflict with
freedom; one must choose. One cannot be both an egalitarian, in this sense, and
a liberal.

This figure is equal to government transfer payments ($ 31.1 billion) less veterans' benefits ($ 4.8 billion), both from the Department of Commerce national income accounts, plus federal expenditures on the agricultural program ($ 5.5 billion) plus federal expenditures on public housing and other aids to housing ($ 0.5 billion), both for year ending June 30, 1961 from Treasury accounts, plus a rough allowance of $ 0.7 billion to raise it to even billions and to allow for administrative costs ot federal programs, omitted state and local programs, and miscellaneous items. My guess is that this figure is a substantial underestimate.
