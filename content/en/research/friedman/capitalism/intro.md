President Kennedy said, ''Ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your
country." It is a striking sign of the temper of our times that the controversy
about this passage centered on its origin and not on its content. Neither half of
the statement expresses a relation between the citizen and his government that
is worthy of the ideals of free men in a free society. The paternalistic "what your
country can do for you" implies that government is the patron, the citizen the
ward, a view that is at odds with the free man's belief in his own responsibility
for his own destiny. The organismic, "what you can do for your country" implies
that government is the master or the deity, the citizen, the servant or the votary.
To the free man, the country is the collection of individuals who compose it, not
something over and above them. He is proud of a common heritage and loyal to
common traditions. But he regards government as a means, an instrumentality,
neither a grantor of favors and gifts, nor a master or god to be blindly
worshipped and served. He recognizes no national goal except as it is the
consensus of the goals that the citizens severally serve. He recognizes no
national purpose except as it is the consensus of the purposes for which the
citizens severally strive.

 The free man will ask neither what his country can do for him nor what he
can do for his country. He will ask rather "What can I and my compatriots do
through government" to help us discharge our individual responsibilities, to
achieve our several goals and purposes, and above all, to protect our freedom?
And he will accompany this question with another: How can we keep the
government we create from becoming a Frankenstein that will destroy the very
freedom we establish it to protect? Freedom is a rare and delicate plant. Our
minds tell us, and history confirms, that the great threat to freedom is the
concentration of power. Government is necessary to preserve our freedom, it is
an instrument through which we can exercise our freedom; yet by concentrating
power in political hands, it is also a threat to freedom. Even though the men who
wield this power initially be of good will and even though they be not corrupted
by the power they exercise, the power will both attract and form men of a
different stamp.

 How can we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the
threat to freedom? Two broad principles embodied in our Constitution give an
answer that has preserved our freedom so far, though they have been violated
repeatedly in practice while proclaimed as precept.

 First, the scope of government must be limited. Its major function must
be to protect our freedom both from the enemies outside our gates and from our
fellow-citizens: to preserve law and order, to enforce private contracts, to foster 
11
competitive markets. Beyond this major function, government may enable us at
times to accomplish jointly what we would find it more difficult or expensive to
accomplish severally. However, any such use of government is fraught with
danger. We should not and cannot avoid using government in this way. But there
should be a clear and large balance of advantages before we do. By relying
primarily on voluntary co-operation and private enterprise, in both economic and
other activities, we can insure that the private sector is a check on the powers of
the governmental sector and an effective protection of freedom of speech, of
religion, and of thought.

 The second broad principle is that government power must be dispersed.
If government is to exercise power, better in the county than in the state, better
in the state than in Washington. If I do not like what my local community does,
be it in sewage disposal, or zoning, or schools, I can move to another local
community, and though few may take this step, the mere possibility acts as a
check. If I do not like what my state does, I can move to another. If I do not like
what Washington imposes, I have few alternatives in this world of jealous
nations.

 The very difficulty of avoiding the enactments of the federal government
is of course the great attraction of centralization to many of its proponents. It
will enable them more effectively, they believe, to legislate programs that as they
see it are in the interest of the public, whether it be the transfer of income from
the rich to the poor or from private to governmental purposes. They are in a
sense right. But this coin has two sides. The power to do good is also the power
to do harm; those who control the power today may not tomorrow; and, more
important, what one man regards as good, another may regard as harm. The
great tragedy of the drive to centralization, as of the drive to extend the scope of
government in general, is that it is mostly led by men of good will who will be
the first to rue its consequences.

 The preservation of freedom is the protective reason for limiting and
decentralizing governmental power. But there is also a constructive reason. The
great advances of civilization, whether in architecture or painting, in science or
literature, in industry or agriculture, have never come from centralized
government. Columbus did not set out to seek a new route to China in response
to a majority directive of a parliament, though he was partly financed by an
absolute monarch. Newton and Leibnitz; Einstein and Bohr; Shakespeare, Milton,
and Pasternak; Whitney, McCormick, Edison, and Ford; Jane Addams, Florence
Nightingale, and Albert Schweitzer; no one of these opened new frontiers in
human knowledge and understanding, in literature, in technical possibilities, or in
the relief of human misery in response to governmental directives. Their
achievements were the product of individual genius, of strongly held minority
views, of a social climate permitting variety and diversity.

 Government can never duplicate the variety and diversity of individual
action. At any moment in time, by imposing uniform standards in housing, or
nutrition, or clothing, government could undoubtedly improve the level of living
of many individuals; by imposing uniform standards in schooling, road
construction, or sanitation, central government could undoubtedly improve the
level of performance in many local areas and perhaps even on the average of all
communities. But in the process, government would replace progress by
stagnation, it would substitute uniform mediocrity for the variety essential for
that experimentation which can bring tomorrow's laggards above today's mean.

 This book discusses some of these great issues. Its major theme is the
role of competitive capitalism the organization of the bulk of economic activity
through private enterprise operating in a free market as a system of economic
freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom. Its minor theme is the
role that government should play in a society dedicated to freedom and relying
primarily on the market to organize economic activity.

 The first two chapters deal with these issues on an abstract level, in terms
of principles rather than concrete application. The later chapters apply these
principles to a variety of particular problems.

 An abstract statement can conceivably be complete and exhaustive,
though this ideal is certainly far from realized in the two chapters that follow.
The application of the principles cannot even conceivably be exhaustive. Each
day brings new problems and new circumstances. That is why the role of the
state can never be spelled out once and for all in terms of specific functions. It is
also why we need from time to time to re-examine the bearing of what we hope
are unchanged principles on the problems of the day. A by-product is inevitably a
retesting of the principles and a sharpening of our understanding of them.

 It is extremely convenient to have a label for the political and economic
viewpoint elaborated in this book. The rightful and proper label is liberalism.
Unfortunately, "As a supreme, if unintended compliment, the enemies of the
system of private enterprise have thought it wise to appropriate its label",1
so
that liberalism has, in the United States, come to have a very different meaning
than it did in the nineteenth century or does today over much of the Continent of
Europe.

 As it developed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the
intellectual movement that went under the name of liberalism emphasized
freedom as the ultimate goal and the individual as the ultimate entity in the
society. It supported laissez faire at home as a means of reducing the role of the state in economic affairs and thereby enlarging the role of the individual; it
supported free trade abroad as a means of linking the nations of the world
together peacefully and democratically. In political matters, it supported the
development of representative government and of parliamentary institutions,
reduction in the arbitrary power of the state, and protection of the civil freedoms
of individuals.

 Beginning in the late nineteenth century, and especially after 1930 in the
United States, the term liberalism came to be associated with a very different
emphasis, particularly in economic policy. It came to be associated with a
readiness to rely primarily on the state rather than on private voluntary
arrangements to achieve objectives regarded as desirable. The catchwords
became welfare and equality rather than freedom. The nineteenth-century liberal
regarded an extension of freedom as the most effective way to promote welfare
and equality; the twentieth-century liberal regards welfare and equality as either
prerequisites of or alternatives to freedom. In the name of welfare and equality,
the twentieth-century liberal has come to favor a revival of the very policies of
state intervention and paternalism against which classical liberalism fought. In
the very act of turning the clock back to seventeenth-century mercantilism, he is
fond of castigating true liberals as reactionary!

 The change in the meaning attached to the term liberalism is more
striking in economic matters than in political. The twentieth-century liberal, like
the nineteenth-century liberal, favors parliamentary institutions, representative
government, civil rights, and so on. Yet even in political matters, there is a
notable difference. Jealous of liberty, and hence fearful of centralized power,
whether in governmental or private hands, the nineteenth-century liberal favored
political decentralization. Committed to action and confident of the beneficence
of power so long as it is in the hands of a government ostensibly controlled by
the electorate, the twentieth-century liberal favors centralized government. He
will resolve any doubt about where power should be located in favor of the state
instead of the city, of the federal government instead of the state, and of a world
organization instead of a national government.

 Because of the corruption of the term liberalism, the views that formerly
went under that name are now often labeled conservatism. But this is not a
satisfactory alternative. The nineteenth-century liberal was a radical, both in the
etymological sense of going to the root of the matter, and in the political sense
of favoring major changes in social institutions. So too must be his modern heir.
We do not wish to conserve the state interventions that have interfered so
greatly with our freedom, though, of course, we do wish to conserve those that
have promoted it, Moreover, in practice, the term conservatism has come to
cover so wide a range of views, and views so incompatible with one another, 
14
that we shall no doubt see the growth of hyphenated designations, such as
libertarian-conservative and arisTOCratic-conservative.

 Partly because of my reluctance to surrender the term to proponents of
measures that would destroy liberty, partly because I cannot find a better
alternative, I shall resolve these difficulties by using the word liberalism in its
original sense as the doctrines pertaining to a free man.
