## 2 Planck's Fundamental Constants

Planck's constant is independent of his theory of "black body radiation".

...

For large values of T /ν; i.e. for large wavelengths and radiation densities, this equation takes the form

...


It is evident that this equation is identical with the one obtained in Sec. 1 from the Maxwellian and electron theories. By equating the coefficients of both formulas one obtains

...

or 

...

An atom of hydrogen weighs 1/N grams = 1.62×10−24 g. 

This is exactly the value found by Planck, which agrees with values found by other methods.

I therefore conclude: the greater the energy density and the wavelength of a radiation, the more useful are the theoretical principles.

In small wavelengths and small radiation densities, however, these principles fail us completely.



## 3. The Entropy of Radiation

Below is Wien's work.

Let there be radiation taking up volume `v`. 

We assume that the observable properties of the radiation are determined completely when the radiation densities `ρ(ν)`` are given for all frequencies.

Since we can regard radiations of different frequency as separable without doing work or transferring heat the entropy of the radiation can be expressed in the form

...

where φ is a function of the variables ρ and ν. 

φ can be reduced to a function of only one variable by expressing that the entropy of radiation between reflecting walls is not changed by adiabatic compression. 

We won't go into that however, but investigate right away how the function φ can be obtained from the radiation law of the black body.

In the case of "black body radiation" ρ is such a function of ν that for a given energy the entropy is a maximum, that is, that

..

When

..

From this it follows that for any choice of δρ as function of ν

...

where λ is independent of ν. In the case of blackbody radiation, therefore,
∂ϕ/∂ρ is independent of ν.

The following equation applies when the temperature of a unit volume of blackbody radiation increases by dT

...

<!-- For the temperature increase of dT of a black body radiation of volume v = 1 the following equation is valid: -->

or, since ∂ϕ/∂ρ is independent of ν.

...

is independent of ν:

...


Since dE is equal to the heat added and since the process is reversible, the following statement also applies:

...

Equating formulas gives:

...

This is the law of blackbody radiation. Therefore one can derive the law of blackbody radiation from the function ϕ, and, inversely, one can derive
the function ϕ by integration, keeping in mind the fact that ϕ vanishes when ρ = 0.


## Limiting (Asymptomic) law for the entropy of monochromatic radiation at low radiation density

Wien's law is not valid:

...


However, for large values of `ν/T` experiment completely confirms the law. 

We shall base our calculations on this formula, keeping in mind that the results will be valid within certain limitations only.

First, we get from this equation:

..


and then, using the relation obtained in the preceding section:

...


Suppose that we have radiation of energy E, with frequency between ν and ν + dν, enclosed in volume v. The entropy of this radiation is:

...


We will limit ourselves to investigating the dependency of the radiation's entropy on the volume that is occupied. 

Let the entropy of the radiation be called S0 when it occupies the volume v0, then we get:

...

This equation shows that the entropy of monochromatic radiation of sufficiently low density varies with volume according to the same law as the entropy of an ideal gas or that of a dilute solution. In the following the equation just found will be interpreted in terms of the principle introduced by Mr. Boltzmann that says that the entropy of a system is a function of the probability of its state.

Molecular Theoretical investigation of the Volume Dependence of the Entropy of Gases and Dilute Solutions
In calculating Entropy on the grounds of molecular theory the word "probability" is often used in a meaning that isn't covered by the definition in probability theory. Especially the "cases of equal probability" are often set by hypothesis, where the applied theoretical representation is sufficiently definite to deduce probabilities without fixing them by hypothesis. I will show in a separate work that in considerations of thermal processes one obtains a complete result with the so-called "statistical probability". This way I hope to remove a logical difficulty that is in the way of fully implementing Boltzmann's principle. Here however only its general formulation and application in quite specific cases will be given.

When it's meaningful to talk about the probability of a state of a system, and additionally every increase of entropy can be described as a transition to a more probable state, the entropy S1 of a system is a function of the probability W1 of its instantaneous state. In the case of two systems S1 and S2, one can state:


If one considers these systems as a single system with entropy S and probability W, then:


and

The latter equation expresses that the states of the two systems are independent.

From these equations it follows:


and hence finally


The quantity C is also a universal constant; it follows from kinetic gas theory, where the constants R and N have the same meaning as above. 

Denoting the entropy at a particular starting state as S0, and the relative probability of a state with entropy S as W we have in general:

We now consider the following special case. Let a number (n) of movable points (for example molecules) be present in a volume v0, these points will be the subject of our considerations. Other than these, arbitrarily many other movable points can be present. As to the law that describes how the considered points move around in the space the only assumption is that no part of the space (and no direction) is favored over others. The number of the (first-mentioned) points that we are considering is so small that mutual interactions are negligible.

The system considered, which can be for example an ideal gas or a diluted solution, has a certain entropy. We take a part of the volume v0 with a size of v and we think of all n movable points displaced to that volume v, with otherwise no change of the system. Clearly this state has another entropy (S), and here we want to determine that entropy difference with the help of Boltzmann's principle.

We ask: how large is the probability of the last-mentioned state relative to the original state? Or, what is the probability that at some point in time all n independently moving points in a volume v0 have by chance ended up in the volume v?

For this probability, which is a "statistical probability" one obtains the value:


one derives from this, applying Boltzmann's principle:


It's noteworthy that for this derivation, from which the Boyle-Gay-Lussac law and the identical law of osmotic pressure can be easily derived thermodynamically [6], there is no need to make any assumption regarding the way the molecules move.

Interpretation of the Volume Dependence of the Entropy of Monochromatic Radiation using Boltzmann's Principle
In paragraph 4 we found for the dependence of Entropy of the monochromatic radiation on volume the expression:


This formula can be recast as follows:


Comparing this with the general formula that expresses Boltzmann's principle


we arrive at the following conclusion:

If monochromatic radiation of frequency ν and energy E is enclosed (by reflecting walls) in the volume v0, then the probability that at an arbitrary point in time all of the radiation energy located in a part v of the volume v0 is:

Subsequently we conclude:

In terms of heat theory monochromatic radiation of low density (within the realm of validity of Wien's radiation formula) behaves as if it consisted of independent energy quanta of the magnitude Rβν/N.

We also want to compare the average magnitude of the energy quanta of the "black body radiation" with the mean average energy of the center-of-mass-motion of a molecule at the same temperature. The latter is 3/2(R/N)T, and for the average energy of the Energy quanta Wien's formula gives:


The fact that monochromatic radiation (of sufficiently low density) behaves as regards to dependency of entropy on volume like a discontinuous medium that consists of energy quanta of magnitude Rβν/N suggests we should investigate whether the laws of generation and transformation of light are what they must be if light consisted of such energy quanta. In the following we will address that question.

## Stokes' Rule

Let monochromatic light be transformed by photoluminence into light of another frequency, and let it be assumed that according to the result just obtained the generating as well as the generated light consists of energy quanta of magnitude (R/N)βν, where ν is the corresponding frequency. 

The transformation process can then be interpreted as follows. Each generating energy quantum of frequency ν1 is absorbed and generates—at least with sufficiently small density of the generating energy quanta—by itself a light quantum of frequency ν2; possibly other light quanta of frequency ν3, ν4 etc. as well as other form of energy (e.g heat) can be generated simultaneously. Through which intermedia processes the final result comes about is immaterial. If the photoluminescing substance isn't a continuous source of energy it follows from the energy principle that the energy of the generated energy quanta are not larger than the generating light quanta; therefore the following relation must hold:


or


As is well known this is Stokes' rule.

Especially noteworthy is that with weak illumination the amount of generated light must, other circumstances being equal, be proportional to the amount of exciting light, since every incident energy quantum will cause one elementary process of the above indicated kind, independent of the action of other exciting energy quanta. In particular there will be no lower limit of the intensity of the exciting light below which the light would be incapable of exciting light.

According to the way the understanding of the phenomena is laid down here deviations from Stokes' rule are conceivable in the following cases:

When the number of energy quanta per unit of volume that are simultaneously involved in the transformation is so large that the energy quantum of the generated light can receive the energy of several exciting energy quanta.

When the generating (or generated) light does not have the energy characteristics of "black body radiation" that is in the realm of validity of Wien's law, when for instance the exciting light is generated by a body of such high temperature that for the wavelengths considered Wien's law is no longer valid.

The last mentioned possibility merits special attention. According to the developed understanding it cannot be excluded that a "non-Wienian radiation", even in high dilution, would behave energetically differently from a "black body radiation" within the validity range of Wien's law.


## The Generation of Cathode Rays by Illumination of Solid Bodies

The usual understanding, that the energy of light is distributed over the space through which it travels in a continuous way encounters extraordinarily large difficulties in attempts to explain photo-electric phenomena, as has been presented in the groundbreaking article by Mr. Lenard. [7].

The exciting light consists of energy quanta of energy (R/N)βν.

The generation of cathode rays by light can be conceived as follows.

Quanta of energy penetrate the surface layer of the solid.

Their energy is transformed, at least partially, in kinetic energy of electrons. 

The simplest picture is one where the light quantum gives its entire energy to a single electron.

Electrons accept the energy of light quanta only partially. 

An electron that has been loaded with kinetic energy will have lost some of its energy when it arrives at the surface. 

Other than that we must assume that on leaving the solid every electron must do an amount of work P (characteristic of that solid).

Electrons residing right at the surface, excited at right angles to it, will leave the solid with the largest normal velocity. The kinetic energy of such electrons is

If the body is charged to a positive potential Π and surrounded by conductors with potential zero and Π is just enough to prevent loss of electricity by the body, then we must have:

...

where ε is the electrical mass of the electron, or


where E is the charge of one gram equivalent of a single-valued ion and P' is the potential of this amount of negative electricity with respect to this body. [8]

If we set E = 9.6·103, then Π·10-8 is the potential in volts that the body will attain when it is irradiated in vacuum.

To see now whether the derived relation agrees with experiment to within an order of magnitude we set P' = 0, ν = 1.03·1015 (corresponding to the ultraviolet limit of the solar spectrum), and β = 4.866·10-11. We obtain Π·107 = 4.3 Volt, which agrees to within an order of magnitude with the results of Mr. Lenard. [9]

If the formula derived is correct, then Π, as a function of frequency of the excited light represented in Cartesian coordinates, must be a straight line, whose inclination is independent from the nature of the substance investigated. As far as I can see no contradiction exists between our understanding and the properties of photo-electric action observed by Mr. Lenard. If each energy quantum of the exciting light releases its energy independently from all others to the electrons, the distribution of velocities of the electrons, which means the quality of the generated cathode radiation, will be independent of the intensity of the exciting light; the number of electrons that exits the body, on the other hand, will, in otherwise equal circumstances, be proportional to the intensity of the exciting light. [10]

We expect that limits of validity of these rules will be similar in nature to the expected deviations from Stokes' rule.

In the preceding it has been assumed that the energy of at least some of the energy quanta of the generating light is transferred completely to a single electron. If one does not start with that natural supposition then instead of the above equation one obtains:


For cathode-luminescence, which constitutes the inverse process of the one just examined, one obtains by way of analogous consideration:


For the materials investigated by Mr. Lenard PE is always significantly larger than Rβν, as the voltage that the cathode rays have had to traverse to generate even visible light is in some cases several hundred, in other cases thousands of volts. [11]

## Ionization of Gases by Ultraviolet Light

We have to assume that in ionization of a gas by ultraviolet light always one absorbed light energy quantum is used for the ionization of just one gas molecule. Firstly it follows that the ionization energy (that is, the theoretically necessary energy to ionize) of a molecule cannot be larger than the energy of an absorbed light energy quantum. Taking J as the (theoretical) ionization energy per gram equivalent, we have:


According to Lenard's measurements for air the largest wavelength that has an effect is about 1.9·10-5 cm, so

An upper limit for the ionization energy can also be obtained from the ionization voltage in rarefied gases. According to Stark [12] the smallest measured ionization voltage (for platinum anodes) is for air about 10 volt. [13] We have thus for J an upper limit 9.6·1012, which is nearly the same as the one just found. There is another consequence that in my mind is very important to verify. If every light energy quantum ionizes one molecule then the following relation must exist between the absorbed quantity of light L and the number j of thereby ionized gram molecules:


If our understanding reflects reality this relation must hold for every gas that (at the particular frequency) has no absorption that isn't accompanied by ionization.

According to Maxwell, energy is a continuous spatial function in the case of electromagnetism. 

Material energy:
- is the sum of energy in its atoms. 
- cannot be subdivided arbitrarily

EM light energy is continuously spread over an increasing volume. 

The wave theory of light works optically. But optical observations are time averages and not instantaneous values. 

The energy of light is discontinuously distributed in space. 
- Instead, it has a finite energy quanta

Quanta are:
- localized points in space which move without dividing
- these move without dividing
- there act as complete units

For small wavelengths.. 




<!-- The energy of light is not continually distributed in space. 

Energy quanta penetrate the surface and are converted into the kinetic energy of electrons.
