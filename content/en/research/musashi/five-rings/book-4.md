In strategy you must know the Ways of other schools, so I have written about various other traditions of strategys in this the Wind Book. 

Without knowledge of the Ways of other schools, it is difficult to understand the essence of my Ichi school. Looking at other schools we find some that specialise in techniques of strength using extra-long swords.

Some schools study the Way of the short sword, known as kodachi.

Some schools teach dexterity in large numbers of sword techniques, teaching attitudes of the sword as the "surface" and the Way as the "interior".

That none of these are the true Way I show clearly in the interior of this book - all the vices and virtues and rights and wrongs. My Ichi school is different. 

Other schools make accomplishments their means of livelihood, growing flowers and decoratively colouring articles in order to sell them. This is definitely not the Way of Strategy.

Some of the world's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing, and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body. But is dexterity alone sufficient to win? This is not the essence of the Way. 

I have recorded the unsatisfactory point of other schools one by one in this book. You must study these matters deeply to appreciate the benefit of my Ni To Ichi school.



## Other Schools Using Extra-Long Swords

Some other schools prefer extra-long swords.

To my strategy, these are weak schools because they do not appreciate the principle of cutting the enemy by any means. 

They rely on its length, intending to defeat the enemy from a distance. 

The idle ones who do not know strategy say, "One inch gives the hand advantage".

It shows the inferior strategy of a weak spirit that men should be dependent on the length of their sword, fighting from a distance without the benefit of strategy.

I expect there is a case for the school in question liking extra-long swords as part of its doctrine, but if we compare this to real life it is unreasonable. 

Surely we need not necessarily be defeated if we are using a short sword, and have no long sword?

It is difficult for them to cut the enemy at close quarters because of the length of the long sword.

The blade path is large so the long sword is an encumbrance, and they are at a disadvantage compared to the man armed with a short companion sword.

From olden times it has been said: "Great and small go together". 

So do not unconditionally dislike extra-long swords. 

What I dislike is the inclination towards the long sword. If we consider large-scale strategy, we can think of large forces in terms of long swords, and small forces as short swords. Cannot few me give battle against many? 

There are many instances of few men overcoming many.

Your strategy is of no account if when called on to fight in a confined space your heart is inclined to the long sword, or if you are in a house armed only with your companion sword.

Besides, some men have not the strength of others. In my doctrine, I dislike preconceived, narrow spirit. You must study this well.


### The Strong Long Sword Spirit in Other Schools

You should not speak of strong and weak long swords.

If you just wield the long sword in a strong spirit your cutting will be coarse, and if you use the sword coarsely you will have difficulty in winning.

If you are concerned with the strength of your sword, you will try to
cut unreasonably strongly, and will not be able to cut at all. 

It is also bad to try to cut strongly when testing the sword. Whenever you cross swords with an enemy you must not think of cutting him either strongly or weakly; just think of cutting and killing him. Be intent solely upon killing the enemy. 

Do not try to cut strongly and, of course, do not think of cutting weakly. You should only be concerned with killing the enemy.

If you rely on strength, when you hit the enemy's sword you will inevitably hit too hard. If you do this, your own sword will be carried along as a result. 

Thus the saying, "The strongest hand wins", has no meaning. In large-scale strategy, if you have a strong army and are relying on strength to win, but the enemy also has a strong army, the battle will be fierce. This is the same for both sides.

Without the correct principle the fight cannot be won. The spirit of my school is to win through the wisdom of strategy, paying no attention to trifles.

Study this well.

## Use of the Shorter Long Sword in Other Schools

Using a shorter long sword is not the true Way to win.
In ancient times, tachi and katana meant long and short swords. Men
of superior strength in the world can wield even a long sword lightly, so
there is no case for their liking the short sword. They also make use of
the length of spears and halberds. Some men use a shorter long sword
with the intention of jumping in and stabbing the enemy at the un-
guarded moment when he flourishes his sword. This inclination is bad.
To aim for the enemy's unguarded moment is completely defensive,
and undesirable at close quarters with the enemy. Furthermore, you can-
not use the method of jumping inside his defence with a short sword if
there are many enemies. Some men think that if they go against many enemies with a shorter long sword they can unrestrictedly frisk around cutting in sweeps, but they have to parry cuts continuously, and eventually become entangled with the enemy. This is inconsistent with the true Way of Strategy.

The sure Way to win thus is to chase the enemy around in confusing manner, causing him to jump aside, with your body held strongly and straight. The same principle applies to large-scale strategy. The essence of strategy is to fall upon the enemy in large numbers and bring about his speedy downfall. By their study of strategy, people of the world get used to countering, evading and retreating as the normal thing. They become set in this habit, so can easily be paraded around by the enemy. 

The Way of Strategy is straight and true. You must chase the enemy
around and make him obey your spirit.
