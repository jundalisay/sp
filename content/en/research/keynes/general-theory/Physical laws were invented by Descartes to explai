Physical laws were invented by Descartes to explain his laws of motion which were really the implementing rules of the Conservation Law of Momentum and Space (Not Energy and Force, since Cartesian Physics uses Aether and Action).  

Assuming that in the current perception there are 100 spinning space-vortices of the 2nd Element, leading to 100 spinning galaxies as 1 universe. 

If Galaxy 1 suddenly gets reduced to 99%, then 0.00010101% will be added to each of the 99 galaxies to conserve the 1 universe. 

1011010001 and wavelengths are a different topic. 

In this case, "I think therefore I am" applies to the action of the aether to actually enforce the conservation law and create motion to balance out the universe which shallow people see as forces. 




 rest A sudden change in galaxy 1 will travel through the 2nd Element and eventually make a change in galaxy 1 trillion. 

 There are 100 sticks of equal length that when combined must total 1 meter exactly. 1 stick gets reduced to 99% of its length. What must the increase in each stick be to keep the total length at 1 meter.
