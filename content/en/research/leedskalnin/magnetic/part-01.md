Following is the result of my two years experiment with magnets at Rock Gate, 17 miles Southwest from Miami, Florida. Between Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Latitude and Eightieth and Eighty-first Longitude West.

First I will describe what a magnet is. You have seen straight bar magnets, U shape magnets, sphere or ball magnets and Alnico magnets in many shapes, and usually a hole in the middle. 

In all magnets, one end of the metal is North Pole and the other South Pole.

Those which have no end one side is North Pole and the other South Pole. 


## The sphere magnet

If you have a strong magnet you can change the poles in the sphere in any side you want or take the poles out so the sphere will not be a magnet any more. 

From this you can see that the magnet can be shifted and concentrated and also you can see that the metal is not the real magnet. 

The real magnet is the substance that is circulating in the metal. 

Each particle in the substance is an individual magnet by itself, and both North and South Pole individual magnets. 

They are so small that they can pass through anything.. In fact they can pass through metal easier than through the air. 

They are in constant motion, they are running one kind of magnets against the other kind, and if guided in the right channels they possess perpetual power. 

The North and South Pole magnets they are cosmic force, they hold together this earth and everything on it. 

Each North and South Pole magnet is equal in strength, but the strength of each individual magnet doesn't amount to anything. 

To be of practical use they will have to be in great numbers. 

In permanent magnets they are circulating in the metal in great numbers, and they circulate in the following way: Each kind of the magnets are coming out of their own end of the pole and are running around, and are running in the other end of the pole and back to its own end, and then over and over again. 

All the individual magnets do not run around. Some run away and never come back, but new ones take their place.

The earth itself is a great big magnet. 

In general these North and South Pole individual magnets are circulating in the same way as in the permanent magnet metal. 

The North Pole individual  magnets are coming out of the earth's South Pole and are running around in the earth's North Pole and back to its own pole, and South Pole individual magnets are coming out of the earth's North Pole and are running around, and in earth South Pole and back to its own end.

Then both North and South Pole individual magnets start to run over and over again. 

In a permanent magnet bar between the poles there is a semi-neutral part where there is not much going in or out, but on the earth there is no place where the magnets are not going in or out, but the magnets are running in and out at pole ends more than at the Equator.  

Now you get the equipment and I will tell you so you can see for yourself that it is in the way I have told, 
Get a permanent magnet bar four inches long. 

A U shape magnet that is strong enough to lift from ten to twenty pounds. An Alnico magnet about three inches long, two and one-half inches wide, one-inch thick.   

Hole in the middle and poles in each end, several feet in length of hard steel fishing line.  Line when it is not in coil it stays straight and a soft steel welding rod one-eighth of an inch thick and three feet long.  From the fishing wire and the welding rod you will make magnets or compasses, and if you hang them up in fine threads by middle and keep them there they will be permanent magnets. 

When you are making a magnet pole in the welding rod use U shape magnet. South Pole magnet to make North Pole magnet in the rod and use U shape North Pole magnet to make South Pole magnet in the rod.  You can drag the magnet over the rod from end to end, but never stop in middle.

If you stop in middle there will be an extra pole so it will disturb the magnet's circulation. Use iron filings to test the rod if there is any magnets in the middle, and if there is the filings will cling to it. Then drag the permanent magnet over the rod and it will take it out. 

To take the magnet out from rod ends approach or touch the rod end with the same kind of magnet that is in the rod, by dipping the rod ends in iron filings, you will see how it works. 

Break three pieces of the steel fishing line just long enough to go in between the two poles of U shape permanent magnet. Put them endwise between the two poles, and take them out. Hang one by middle with fine thread, and hang it up in East side of the room where there is no other magnet or metal around. Now you will have a permanent magnet or compass to test the polarity in other magnets. For more delicate use hang the magnet in spider web. To test the strength of a magnet use iron filings. 

Put the U shape permanent magnet two feet West from the hanging magnet. Hold the North Pole magnet in level with the hanging magnet, then you will see that the South pole of the hanging magnet is turning to you and the North Pole magnet away from you. 

Put the South Pole permanent magnet pole in the same level, this time North Pole magnet will turn to you and South Pole magnet away from you. This experiment shows two things, one that the magnets can be sent out in straight streams, and the other whatever kind of magnets you are sending out the other kind of magnets are coming back to you. 

Take two pieces of steel fishing line wire, put them in U shape magnet, hold a little while, take them out, bend a little back in one end and hang them up, and make it so that one magnet's lower end is North Pole magnet and the other South Pole magnet - 

Make it so that they hang three inches apart. Put North Pole North side, and South Pole South side. Now take the four-inch long permanent magnet bar, hold North Pole in North side and South Pole in South side. Raise slowly up to the two hanging magnets, then you will see that the hanging magnets are closing up. Now reverse, put North Pole of bar magnet South side and South Pole North side.

This time when bar magnet approaches the hanging magnets will spread out. This experiment shows that North and South Pole magnets are equal in strength and that the streams of individual magnets are running one kind of magnets against the other kind.

Cut a strip of a tin can about two inches wide and a foot long. Put the North Pole of the U shape magnet on top of the strip, and dip the lower end in iron filings, and see how much it lifts. Now put the South Pole on top and see how much it lifts. Change several times, then you will see that the North Pole lifts more than the South Pole.

Now put the North Pole magnet under the iron filing box, and see how much it pushes up. Now change. put South Pole magnet under the box and see how much it pushes up. 

Do this several times, then you will see that the South Pole magnet pushes up more than North Pole magnet.  This experiment shows again that on level ground the magnets are in equal strength. 

Now take the three-foot long soft steel welding rod. It is already magnetized as a permanent magnet. hang it in a fine thread so it is in level. Now measure each and you will see that the South end is longer. 

In my location at Rock Gate, between Twenty-fifth and Twenty-sixth Latitude and Eightieth and Eighty- first Longitude West, in three-foot long magnet the South Pole end is about a sixteenth of an inch longer. Farther North it should be longer yet, but at Equator both ends of the magnet should be equal in length. In earth's South hemisphere the North Pole end of magnet should be longer.

All my hanging magnets or compasses they never point to the earth's magnetic pole, neither to the geographical pole. They point a little Northeast. 

The only reason I can figure out why they point in that way is, looking from the same geographical meridian the North magnetic pole is on, the South magnetic pole is one hundred and fifteen longitudes West from it.

In rough estimation the earth's South magnetic pole is two hundred and sixty miles West from the same meridian the earth's North magnetic pole is on. 

That causes the North and South Pole magnets to run in Northeast and Southwest direction My location is too far away from the magnetic poles so all my magnets are guided by the general stream of individual North and South Pole magnets that are passing by.

Now I will tell you what magnetic current is. Magnetic current is the same as electric current is a wrong expression. Really it is not one current, they are two currents, one current is composed of North Pole individual magnets in concentrated streams and the other is composed of South Pole individual magnets in concentrated streams, and they are running one stream against the other stream in whirling, screwlike fashion, and with high speed. 

One current alone if it be North Pole magnet current or South Pole magnet current it cannot run alone. To run one current will have to run against the other.

Now I will tell you how the currents are running when they come out of a car battery, and what they can do. Now get the equipment. First put a wooden box on floor, open side up, cut two notches in middle so you can put a one-eighth of an inch thick and eighteen-inch long copper wire across the box. 

Put the wire one end East, the other West. Stay yourself West, put car battery South side of the box positive terminal East, negative terminal West, get two flexible leads and four clips to fit the battery and the bare copper wire, connect the East end of the copper wire with positive terminal, clip the West end of the copper wire with the West side flexible lead, leave the connection with negative terminal open. 

Break two pieces of the steel fishing line one inch long, put each piece by middle across the copper wire, one on top of the copper wire and the other under, hold with your fingers, now touch the negative terminal with the loose clip, hold until the copper wire gets hot. Take them off, now you have two magnets, hang them up by middle in fine thread. The upper magnet will hang the way it is now, but the one below will turn around. 

Break five inches long piece of the fishing line, put the middle of the wire across and on top of the copper wire, touch the battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot, dip the middle of the wire in iron filings, then you will see how long a magnet can be made with this equipment. 

Break or cut several pieces of the hard steel fishing wire as long as to go between the poles of the U shape magnet, now hold two pieces of the steel wire ends up and down, one wire South side of the copper wire, and the other North side, the lower ends just below the copper wire. Hold tight and touch the battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot, now hang them up by upper end just above the copper wire, touch battery, the South side magnet will swing South, and the North side magnet will swing North. 

Put two pieces on top of the copper wire, the ends just a little over the copper wire. Those ends lying on copper wire, one pointing South and the other North, hold tight, touch battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot. take off the one pointing South is South Pole magnet and the one pointing North is North pole magnet. Put one wire on top of the copper wire pointing South, other below pointing North. Magnetize, hang up by tail ends on the copper wire, touch battery they both will swing South. Put one wire on top of the copper wire pointing North, the other below pointing South, magnetize, hang up by tail end above the copper wire, touch the battery, both magnets will swing North.

Cut six pieces of fishing wire one inch long, put them by middle on top and across the copper wire. Hold tight, touch battery, hold until copper wire gets hot. Take off, now put glass over the copper wire, put those six pieces of magnets on glass, on top of the copper wire lengthwise just so the ends don't touch each other, touch the battery, they all will turn across the copper wire, now pull three to South side and three to North side in the same way, they lie now but about one-half of an inch away from the copper wire, touch battery, they all will jump on the copper wire. Now roll all six together, let loose, and you will see that they won't stay together.

Magnetize one piece in U shape magnet, put North Pole end East on the copper wire, and South Pole West, touch the battery, the magnet will swing left. Now put South Pole East side and North Pole West side, this time the magnet will turn right, take glass off. 

Take one piece of hard steel fishing wire, dip in iron filings and see there is no magnet in it. This time hold the wire up, and down, the lower end on middle of the copper wire, hold tight. Touch the battery, hold until the copper wire gets hot.  

Take it off. Dip the wire in iron filings and you will see that it is no magnet. Why? To make magnets with currents from batteries and dynamos with a single wire the metal will have to be put on the wire in such a way so that the magnets which are coming out of the wire will be running in the metal starting from the middle of the metal and run to the end and not from end to middle and across as they did this last time. You have read that to make a South Pole in a coil end that is pointing to you, you will have to run positive electricity in the coil in clockwise direction. I can tell you that the positive electricity has nothing to do with making a South magnet pole in the coil. Each pole South or North is made by their own magnets in the way they are running in the wire.  This magnet-making with a single wire, it illustrates how all magnets are made.

In a car battery the North Pole magnets run out of positive terminal and South Pole magnets run out of negative terminal. Both kinds of magnets are running, one kind of magnets against the other kind, and are running in the same right-hand screw fashion.  By using the same whirling motion and running one kind of magnets against the other kind, they throw their own magnets from the wire in opposite directions.  That is why if you put a magnet metal across the copper wire the one end is North Pole and the other end South Pole.

Get four pieces of wire size sixteen, six inches long, two copper and two soft iron, bend one end of each wire back so the clips can hold it better. Use copper wire first. Put both wires in clips, connect with battery, have the wire ends square, now put the loose ends together, and pull them away. Then you will notice that something is holding you back. What is it? They are magnets. When you put the ends together, the North and South Pole magnets are passing from one wire to the other, and in doing it they pull the wire ends together. Now put the soft iron wire in the clips, put the loose ends together, and pull them away. This time the passing magnets hold the wire ends together stronger. Put the ends together many times, then you `will see which wire end gets red first, and which will make the bigger bubble in the end, and watch the little sparks coming out from the bubbles.  Stretch the bubbles out while they are in liquid form, then you will see in the bubble that something is whirling around. Those little sparks you see coming out of the bubble, they are not the magnets, but the magnets are the ones which throw the sparks out of the bubbles. When all the magnets that are in the wire, if they cannot pass over to the other wire, they ore expending the bubble and running out of it and carrying the metal sparks with them. When the bubble is cool, break it up, then you will see the space left where the magnets were in.

Get two pieces of lumber, one by six inches, a foot long, nail them together so that one lies flat on floor and the other on top the edges up and down. Out a notch in end in upper piece, four inches deep and as high as to hold a piece of wood or brass that would hold needle points in ends and have a hole in middle to hold the three-foot magnet.  Balance the magnet good so it would stop on its right magnetic position. Now put the car battery South side positive terminal East and negative terminal West.

Connect the East end of the copper wire with positive terminal and connect the West end of the copper wire with the West side lead, hold the copper wire just above the magnet a quarter of an inch North of magnet's end, hold in level and square. Touch the battery, then you will see the magnet swinging East. 

Now put the' battery North side, positive terminal East, negative terminal West, connect West end of the copper wire with negative terminal, connect East end  of copper wire with East side lead. put the copper wire on top of the magnet a quarter of an inch South of magnet's end, hold the copper wire just above in square and level, touch the positive terminal, then you will see the magnet swinging West.  If the battery is right, magnet strong enough, and the magnet rod balanced good it will repeat the same thing every time.

I think the batteries are not made right. Sometimes there is more of North Pole magnets than there is South Pole magnets. They should be equal. the same as from generators which do not run the South Pole magnets in frame or base, but run directly away the same as they run the North Pole magnets.

From the following experiment you will see that the battery is not balanced right. Put the copper wire across the box, one end East, the other end West, connect one lead a foot West from East end and the other lead with West end, hang a magnet in spider web, put the magnet in same level with the copper wire. Keep the copper wire end a little away from magnet's North Pole, con- nect East lead with positive terminal, tap the negative terminal several times with the loose clip. and see what the magnet is doing.

Change the terminal, change the tapping, move the box and copper wire to the South Pole end, repeat - the same thing. Then you will notice sometimes the copper wire end pushes away the North Pole magnet, and sometimes it pulls it in and the same thing happens with South Pole magnet, and sometimes it does nothing.  So it shows the battery is irregular. 

Connect the leads with battery's terminals to make a loop, keep the leads on the same level with battery, drag a hanging magnet over the loop and the connections between the battery's terminals. 

You will see that one end of the magnet keeps inside the loop, and the other outside, and the same thing happens when the magnet crosses the connection between the terminals.

This experiment indicates that the North and South Pole magnet currents we not only running from one terminal to the other, but are running around in an orbit and are not only running one time around, but are running many times wound until the North and South Pole individual magnets get thrown out of the wire by centrifugal force, and by crowding.  

While the North and South Pole magnets were in their own terminals they only possessed pushing power, the pulling power they acquire only if the other kind of magnets are in front of them, like the permanent magnets if you put the opposite magnet in front of it, then they will hold together The same way you have done with the six inches long pieces of copper and soft iron wire.
