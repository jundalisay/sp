Before I say anything about the government, let's establish a base for reasoning. All our ideas should produce good and lasting results and then anything that is good now would have been good in the past and it will be good in the future and it will be good under any circumstances, so any idea that does not cover all this broad base is no good.

To be right, one's thought will have to be based on natural facts, for really, Mother Nature only can what is right and what is wrong and the way that things should be.

My definition of right is that right is anything in nature that exists without artificial modification and all the others are wrong.

Suppose you would say it is wrong. In that case, I would say you are wrong yourself because you came into this world through natural circumstances that you had nothing to do with and so long as such


a thing exists as yourself, I am right and you are wrong. Only those are right whose thoughts are based on natural facts and inclinations.

It is natural tendency for all living things to take it easy. You watch any living thing you want to, and you will see that as soon as they fill up, they will lie down and take it easy.

The physical comfort, the ease, that is the only thing in this world that satisfies. It cannot be overdone and it is the real base of all our actions. We all cannot take things easy because there is too much competition from other people only those who possess good management will succeed by exploiting domestic animals, machinery, other people and natural resources.

Everything will have to be produced that is consumed and to those who have to produce the things themselves, they are consuming the easy days are not coming to them.

It has been told to you that the government is for the purpose of protecting "life" and property, but it really is to protect "property" and life. Nobody wants your life but everybody wants your property.

In International dealings, when an army conquers the land, they don't want the people, they want the physical property and so do the thieves and the bandits. They want your money and property and if you will submit peacefully, they won't harm you.


Nobody wants you, they want your property so really the property is the one that needs the protection and not you. You are the protector yourself.

Government to be lasting will have to be just. This means it will have to protect all the property alike and all the property will have to pay equal taxes, which means big property, big taxes, and small property, small taxes. Government cannot exist without taxes so only those who pay taxesshould vote and vote according to the taxes they pay.

It is not sound to allow the weaklings to vote. Any one who is too weak to make his own living is not strong enough to vote, because their weak influence weakens the state and a degenerated state cannot exist very long, but every state should be sound and lasting.

By voting, the voters dictate the state's destiny for times to come and then to allow such a weak influence to guide the state, it is not wise and so you see one should vote according to how he is carrying the State's burden.

Another unwise thing about equal voting is that it gives the loafers and weaklings the power to take the property away from producers and stronger people, and then another unjust thing about equal voting is that it gives the loafers and weaklings the power to demand an easy life from the producers and leaders.
    

Self respecting producers will not stand such an injustice for long. It is not the producers' fault when one is too weak to make his own living. The producer's life is just as sweet as the weaklings and loafers life is to them. All people are independent so you see everybody will have to take care of themselves and if they cannot, they should perish and the sooner they perish the better it will be.

To be lasting, the government should be built in the same way as the Supreme power of the land "the army." Governments have been rising and falling but the army always remains. You know there is no equality in army and so there can be no equality in the state if you are not equal producer you cannot be an equal consumer.

Fifty per cent of the people don't want to lead, they want to follow. They want somebody else to furnish the money for their living expenses and as long as such a condition exists, they are not equal with their leaders. That is the reason why everybody should be put in the right place according to their physical and mental ability.

There is only one way to share the National income. It is by sharing the production and if you are not producing equally you cannot share equally. Nobody is producing anything for the others. They are producing only for themselves.

People are individuals. For instance, if you want an excitement you have to test the thrill yourself, or if you have a pain you will have to bear it yourself, or if you want to eat you will have to eat for yourself. Nobody can eat for you and so it is that if you want the things to eat you will have to produce them yourself and if you are too weak, too lazy, lack machinery and good management to produce them, you should perish and that is all there is to it.
