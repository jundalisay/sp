“Lord Krishna!” 

Krishna appeared in a shimmering blaze outside the Regent Hotel in Bombay as I gazed out of my third-story window.

<!-- Shining over the roof of a high building across the street, the ineffable vision had suddenly burst on my sight as . -->

It waved to me, smiling and nodding in greeting. I could not understand the exact message of Lord Krishna, but he departed with a gesture of blessing. 

<!-- Wondrously uplifted, I felt that some spiritual event was presaged. -->

My Western voyage had been cancelled.

I was scheduled for several public addresses in Bombay before leaving on a return visit to Bengal.

Sitting on my bed in the Bombay hotel at 3PM of June 19, 1936-one week after the vision of Krishna-I was roused from my meditation by a beatific light.

<!-- Before my open and astonished eyes, the whole room was transformed into a strange world, the sunlight transmuted into supernal splendor. -->

<!-- Waves of rapture engulfed me as I beheld  -->

It came from the flesh and blood form of Sri Yukteswar!

My son!

<!-- For the first time in my life I did not kneel at his feet in greeting but instantly advanced to gather him hungrily in my arms. Moment of moments! The anguish of past months was toll I counted weightless against the torrential bliss now descending. -->


{{< l a="Yogananda" >}}
Master, why did you leave me? Why did you let me go to the Kumbha Mela? I have blamed myself bitterly for leaving you!

KRISHNA, ANCIENT PROPHET OF INDIA

A modern artist’s conception of the divine teacher whose spiritual counsel in the Bhagavad Gita has become the Hindu Bible. Krishna is portrayed in Hindu art with a peacock feather in his hair (symbol of the Lord’s lila, play or creative sport), and carrying a flute, whose enrapturing notes awaken the devotees, one by one, from their sleep of maya or cosmic delusion. -->

 <!-- where first I met Babaji -->
{{< r a="Sri Yukteswar" >}}
I did not want to interfere with your happy pilgrimage spot. I left you only for a little while; am I not with you again?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Yogananda" >}}
But is it really you, Master, the same Lion of God? Is this the same body as the one I buried beneath the cruel Puri sands?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Sri Yukteswar" >}}
Yes, this is a flesh and blood body. I see it as ethereal, but to your sight it is physical. From the cosmic atoms I created an entirely new body, exactly like that cosmic-dream physical body which you laid beneath the dream-sands at Puri in your dream-world. I am on an astral planet. Its inhabitants are better able than earthly humanity to meet my lofty standards. You and your exalted loved ones shall someday come to be with me here.

<!-- “Deathless guru, tell me more!”
Master gave a quick, mirthful chuckle. “Please, dear one,” he said, “won’t you relax your hold a little?”
“Only a little!”  -->

I had been embracing him with an octopus grip. I could detect the same faint, fragrant, natural odor which had been characteristic of his body before. 

<!-- The thrilling touch of his divine flesh still persists around the inner sides of my arms and in my palms whenever I recall those glorious hours. -->


{{< r a="Sri Yukteswar" >}}
Prophets are sent on earth to help men work out their physical karma. Likewise, I have been directed by God to serve on an astral planet as a savior. It is called Hiranyaloka or ‘Illumined Astral Planet.’ 

There I am aiding advanced beings to rid themselves of astral karma and thus attain liberation from astral rebirths. The dwellers on Hiranyaloka are highly developed spiritually. All of them had acquired, in their last earth-incarnation, the meditation-given power of consciously leaving their physical bodies at death. 

No one can enter Hiranyaloka unless he has passed on earth beyond the state of savikalpa samadhi into the higher state of nirbikalpa samadhi.

The Hiranyaloka inhabitants have already passed through the ordinary astral spheres, where nearly all beings from earth must go at death. There they worked out many seeds of their past actions in the astral worlds. 

Only advanced beings can perform such redemptive work effectually in the astral worlds. Then, in order to free their souls more fully from the cocoon of karmic traces lodged in their astral bodies, these higher beings were drawn by cosmic law to be reborn with new astral bodies on Hiranyaloka, the astral sun or heaven, where I have resurrected to help them. 

There are also highly advanced beings on Hiranyaloka who have come from the superior, subtler, causal world.

My mind was now in such perfect attunement with my guru’s that he was conveying his word-pictures to me partly by speech and partly by thought-transference. I was thus quickly receiving his idea-tabloids.

{{< r a="Sri Yukteswar" >}}
You have read in the scriptures that God encased the human soul successively in 3 bodies:
1. The idea or causal body
2. The subtle astral body, seat of man’s mental and emotional natures
3. The gross physical body

On earth, a man is equipped with his physical senses. An astral being works with his consciousness and feelings and a body made of lifetrons. A causal-bodied being remains in the blissful realm of ideas. My work is with those astral beings who are preparing to enter the causal world.

<!-- Please tell me more about the astral cosmos.

Though I had slightly relaxed my embrace at Sri Yukteswar’s request, my arms were still around him. Treasure beyond all treasures, my guru who had laughed at death to reach me! -->
