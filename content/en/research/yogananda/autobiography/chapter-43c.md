The earth-liberated astral being:
- meets many relatives, fathers, mothers, wives, husbands, and friends, acquired during different incarnations on earth.
  - These appear from time to time in various parts of the astral realms.
- therefore is at a loss to understand whom to love especially.
- learns in this way to give a divine and equal love to all, as children and individualized expressions of God. 

The outward appearance of loved ones may have changed according to the qualities they have developed from their latest life.

The astral being employs his unerring intuition to:
- recognize all those once dear to him in other planes of existence
- welcome them to their new astral home

Every atom in creation is inextinguishably dowered with individuality.

An astral friend will be recognized no matter what costume he may don.

<!-- , even as on earth an actor’s identity is discoverable by close observation despite any disguise. -->

The span of life in the astral world is much longer than on earth.

A normal advanced astral being’s average lifetime is from 500-1,000 Earth-years.

<!-- , measured in accordance with earthly standards of time.  -->

<!-- As certain redwood trees outlive most trees by millenniums, or as some yogis live several hundred years though most men die before the age of sixty, so  -->

Some astral beings can live much longer than the usual span of astral existence. 

The time spent by visitors to the astral world is based on the weight of their physical karma.
- This draws them back to earth within a specified time.

The astral being do not worry about shedding his luminous body [to go back to Earth[.

<!-- have to contend painfully with death at the time of  -->

Many of these beings nevertheless feel slightly nervous at the thought of dropping their astral form for the subtler causal one. 

The astral world is free from unwilling death, disease, and old age. 

These 3 dreads are the curse of earth because man has allowed his consciousness to identify itself almost wholly with a frail physical body requiring constant aid from air, food, and sleep in order to exist at all.

Physical death is attended by:
- the disappearance of breath
- the disintegration of fleshly cells

Astral death consists of the dispersement of lifetrons, those manifest units of energy which constitute the life of astral beings.

At physical death, a being loses his consciousness of flesh and becomes aware of his subtle body in the astral world.

Experiencing astral death in due time, a being thus passes from the consciousness of astral birth and death to that of physical birth and death.

These recurrent cycles of astral and physical encasement are the ineluctable destiny of all unenlightened beings. 

Scriptural definitions of heaven and hell sometimes stir man’s deeper-than-subconscious memories of his long series of experiences in the blithesome astral and disappointing terrestrial worlds.

<!-- “Beloved Master,” I asked, “will you please describe more in detail the difference between rebirth on the earth and in the astral and causal spheres?” -->


## The difference between rebirth on the earth and in the astral and causal spheres

Man as an individualized soul is essentially causal-bodied.

That body is a matrix of the 35 ideas required by God as the basic or causal thought forces from which He later formed the subtle astral body of 19 elements and the gross physical body of 16 elements.

The 19 elements of the astral body are mental, emotional, and lifetronic.

The 19 components are:

1. intelligence
2. ego
3 feeling
4 mind (sense-consciousness)
5-9 five instruments of knowledge, the subtle counterparts of the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch
10-14 five instruments of action, the mental correspondence for the executive abilities to procreate, excrete, talk, walk, and exercise manual skill
15 five instruments of life force, those empowered to perform the crystallizing, assimilating, eliminating, metabolizing, and circulating functions of the body. 

This subtle astral encasement of 19 elements survives the death of the physical body, which is made of 16 gross metallic and nonmetallic elements.

God thought out different ideas within Himself and projected them into dreams. Lady Cosmic Dream thus sprang out decorated in all her colossal endless ornaments of relativity.

In 35 thought categories of the causal body, God elaborated all the complexities of man’s nineteen astral and sixteen physical counterparts. 

By condensation of vibratory forces, first subtle, then gross, He produced man’s astral body and finally his physical form. 

According to the law of relativity, by which the Prime Simplicity has become the bewildering manifold, the causal cosmos and causal body are different from the astral cosmos and astral body; the physical cosmos and physical body are likewise characteristically at variance with the other forms of creation.

The fleshly body is made of the fixed, objectified dreams of the Creator. The dualities are ever-present on earth: disease and health, pain and pleasure, loss and gain. 

Human beings find limitation and resistance in three-dimensional matter. When man’s desire to live is severely shaken by disease or other causes, death arrives; the heavy overcoat of the flesh is temporarily shed. The soul, however, remains encased in the astral and causal bodies. 

The adhesive force by which all 3 bodies are held together is desire. 

The power of unfulfilled desires is the root of all man’s slavery.

Physical desires are rooted in egotism and sense pleasures. The compulsion or temptation of sensory experience is more powerful than the desire-force connected with astral attachments or causal perceptions.

Astral desires center around enjoyment in terms of vibration. 

Astral beings enjoy the ethereal music of the spheres and are entranced by the sight of all creation as exhaustless expressions of changing light. The astral beings also smell, taste, and touch light. 

Astral desires are thus connected with an astral being’s power to precipitate all objects and experiences as forms of light or as condensed thoughts or dreams.

Causal desires are fulfilled by perception only. 

The nearly-free beings who are encased only in the causal body see the whole universe as realizations of the dream-ideas of God.

They can materialize anything and everything in sheer thought. Causal beings therefore consider the enjoyment of physical sensations or astral delights as gross and suffocating to the soul’s fine sensibilities. Causal beings work out their desires by materializing them instantly. 

Those who find themselves covered only by the delicate veil of the causal body can bring universes into manifestation even as the Creator. 

Because all creation is made of the cosmic dream-texture, the soul thinly clothed in the causal has vast realizations of power.

A soul is invisible by nature. It can be distinguished only by the presence of its body or bodies. 

The mere presence of a body signifies that its existence is made possible by unfulfilled desires.

So long as the soul of man is encased in one, two, or three body- containers, sealed tightly with the corks of ignorance and desires, he cannot merge with the sea of Spirit. 

When the gross physical receptacle is destroyed by the hammer of death, the other two coverings-astral and causal-still remain to prevent the soul from consciously joining the Omnipresent Life. When desirelessness is attained through wisdom, its power disintegrates the two remaining vessels. 

The tiny human soul emerges, free at last; it is one with the Measureless Amplitude.
