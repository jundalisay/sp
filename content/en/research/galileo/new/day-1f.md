Everyday experience shows that the propagation of light is instantaneous.

When artillery is fired at great distance, the flash reaches our eyes instantly. But the sound reaches the ear only after an interval.

{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
The only thing I am able to infer from this familiar bit of experience is that sound, in reaching our ear, travels more slowly than light.

It does not tell me whether that light is instantaneous or not.

 <!-- An observation of this kind tells us nothing more than one in which it is claimed that "As soon as the sun reaches the horizon its light reaches our eyes "; but who will assure me that these rays had not reached this limit earlier than they reached our vision? -->

{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
The small conclusiveness of these and other similar observations once led me to devise a method by which one might accurately ascertain whether illumination, i.  e. , the propagation of light, is really instantaneous.  The fact that the speed of (43) [88] sound is as high as it is, assures us that the motion of light cannot fail to be extraordinarily swift.  The experiment which I devised was as follows:

Let each of two persons take a light contained in a lantern, or other receptacle, such that by the interposition of the hand, the one can shut off or admit the light to the vision of the other.  

Next let them stand opposite each other at a distance of a few cubits and practice until they acquire such skill in uncovering and occulting their lights that the instant one sees the light of his companion he will uncover his own.  After a few trials the response will be so prompt that without sensible error [svario] the uncovering of one light is immediately followed by the uncovering of the other, so that as soon as one exposes his light he will instantly see that of the other.  

Having acquired skill at this short distance let the two experimenters, equipped as before, take up positions separated by a distance of two or three miles and let them perform the same experiment at night, noting carefully whether the exposures and occultations occur in the same manner as at short distances; if they do, we may safely conclude that the propagation of light is instantaneous; but if time is required at a distance of three miles which, considering the going of one light and the coming of the other, really amounts to six, then the delay ought to be easily observable.  

If the experiment is to be made at still greater distances, say eight or ten miles, telescopes may be employed, each observer adjusting one for himself at the place where he is to make the experiment at night; then although the lights are not large and are therefore invisible to the naked eye at so great a distance, they can readily be covered and uncovered since by aid of the telescopes, once adjusted and fixed, they will become easily visible.

This experiment strikes me as a clever and reliable invention.  But tell us what you conclude from the results. 
{{< /r >}}


SALV.   In fact I have tried the experiment only at a short distance, less than a mile, from which I have not been able to ascertain with certainty whether the appearance of the opposite (44) light was instantaneous or not; but if not instantaneous it is extraordinarily rapid -- I should call it momentary; and for the present I should compare it to motion which we see in the lightning flash between clouds eight or ten miles distant from us.  We see the beginning of this light -- I might say its head and [89] source -- located at a particular place among the clouds; but it immediately spreads to the surrounding ones, which seems to be an argument that at least some time is required for propagation; for if the illumination were instantaneous and not gradual, we should not be able to distinguish its origin -- its center, so to speak -- from its outlying portions.  What a sea we are gradually slipping into without knowing it! With vacua and infinities and indivisibles and instantaneous motions, shall we ever be able, even by means of a thousand discussions, to reach dry land?


{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
Really these matters lie far beyond our grasp. When we seek the infinite among numbers we find it in unity; that which is ever divisible is derived from indivisibles; the vacuum is found inseparably connected with the plenum.

The views commonly held concerning the nature of these matters are so reversed that even the circumference of a circle turns out to be an infinite straight line, a fact which, if my memory serves me correctly, you, Salviati, were intending to demonstrate geometrically.  Please therefore proceed without further digression.

{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
SALV.  Given a straight line divided into unequal parts which bear to each other any ratio whatever, to describe a circle such that two straight lines drawn from the ends of the given line to any point on the circumference will bear to each other the same ratio as the two parts of the given line, thus making those lines which are drawn from the same terminal points homologous.  Let AB represent the given straight line divided into any two unequal parts by the point C; the problem is to describe a circle (45) such that two straight lines drawn from the terminal points, A and B, to any point on the circumference will bear to each other the same ratio as the part AC bears to BC, so that lines drawn from the same terminal points are homologous.  About C as center describe a circle having the shorter part CB of the given line, as radius.  Through A draw a straight line AD which [90] shall be tangent to the circle at D and indefinitely prolonged toward E.  Draw the radius CD which will be perpendicular to AE.  At B erect a perpendicular to AB; this perpendicular will intersect AE at some point since the angle at A is acute; call this point of intersection E, and from it draw a perpendicular to AE which will intersect AB prolonged in F.  Now I say the two straight lines FE and FC are equal.  For if we join E and C, we shall have two triangles, DEC and BEC, in which the two sides of the one, DE and EC, are equal to the two sides of the other, BE and EC, both DE and EB being tangents to the circle DB while the bases DC and CB are likewise equal; hence the two angles, DEC and BEC, will be equal.  Now since the angle BCE differs from a right angle by the angle CEB, and the angle CEF also differs from a right angle by the angle CED, and since these differences are equal, it follows that the angle FCE is equal to CEF; consequently the sides FE and FC are equal.  If we describe a circle with F as center and FE as radius it will pass through the point C; let CEG be such a circle.  This is the circle sought, for if we draw lines from the terminal points A and B to any point on its circumference they will bear to each other Fig 8 (46)

the same ratio as the two portions AC and BC which meet at the point C.  This is manifest in the case of the two lines AE and BE, meeting at the point E, because the angle E of the triangle AEB is bisected by the line CE, and therefore AC:CB = AE:BE.  The same may be proved of the two lines AG and BG terminating in the point G.  For since the triangles AFE and EFB are similar, we have AF:FE = EF:FB, or AF:FC = CF:FB, and dividendo AC:CF = CB:BF, or AC:FG = CB:BF; also componendo we have both AB:BG = CB:BF and AG:GB = CF:FB = AE:EB = AC:BC.  Q.E.D.  [91]

Take now any other point in the circumference, say H, where the two lines AH and BH intersect; in like manner we shall have AC:CB = AH:HB.  Prolong HB until it meets the circumference at I and join IF; and since we have already found that AB:BG = CB:BF it follows that the rectangle AB. BF is equal to the rectangle CB. BG or IB. BH.  Hence AB:BH = IB:BF.  But the angles at B are equal and therefore AH:HB = IF:FB = EF:FB = AE:EB. 

Besides, I may add, that it is impossible for lines which maintain this same ratio and which are drawn from the terminal points, A and B, to meet at any point either inside or outside the circle, CEG.  For suppose this were possible; let AL and BL be two such lines intersecting at the point L outside the circle: prolong LB till it meets the circumference at M and join MF.  If AL:BL = AC:BC = MF:FB, then we shall have two triangles ALB and MFB which have the sides about the two angles proportional, the angles at the vertex, B, equal, and the two remaining angles, FMB and LAB, less than right angles (because the right angle at M has for its base the entire diameter CG and not merely a part BF: and the other angle at the point A is acute because the line AL, the homologue of AC, is greater than BL, the homologue of BC).  From this it follows that the triangles ABL and MBF are similar and therefore AB:BL = MB:BF, making the rectangle AB. BF = MB. BL; but it has been demonstrated that the rectangle AB. BF is equal to CB. BG; whence it would follow that the rectangle MB. BL is equal to the (47) rectangle CB. BG which is impossible; therefore the intersection cannot fall outside the circle.  And in like manner we can show that it cannot fall inside; hence all these intersections fall on the circumference. 

But now it is time for us to go back and grant the request of Simplicio, by showing him that it is not only not impossible to resolve a line into an infinite number of points but that this is quite as easy as to divide it into its finite parts.  This I will do under the following condition which I am sure, Simplicio, you will not deny me, namely, that you will not require me to separate the points, one from the other, and show them to you, [92] one by one, on this paper; for I should be content that you, without separating the four or six parts of a line from one another, should show me the marked divisions or at most that you should fold them at angles forming a square or a hexagon: for, then, I am certain you would consider the division distinctly and actually accomplished. 
{{< /l >}}


SIMP.   I certainly should. 


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
If now the change which takes place when you bend a line at angles so as to form now a square, now an octagon, now a polygon of forty, a hundred or a thousand angles, is sufficient to bring into actuality the four, eight, forty, hundred, and thousand parts which, according to you, existed at first only potentially in the straight line, may I not say, with equal right, that, when I have bent the straight line into a polygon having an infinite number of sides, i.  e. , into a circle, I have reduced to actuality that infinite number of parts which you claimed, while it was straight, were contained in it only potentially? Nor can one deny that the division into an infinite number of points is just as truly accomplished as the one into four parts when the square is formed or into a thousand parts when the millagon is formed; for in such a division the same conditions are satisfied as in the case of a polygon of a thousand or a hundred thousand sides.  Such a polygon laid upon a straight line touches it with one of its sides, i.  e. , with one of its hundred thousand parts; while the circle which is a polygon of an infinite number of sides (48) touches the same straight line with one of its sides which is a single point different from all its neighbors and therefore separate and distinct in no less degree than is one side of a polygon from the other sides.  And just as a polygon, when rolled along a plane, marks out upon this plane, by the successive contacts of its sides, a straight line equal to its perimeter, so the circle rolled upon such a plane also traces by its infinite succession of contacts a straight line equal in length to its own circumference.  I am willing, Simplicio, at the outset, to grant to the Peripatetics the truth of their opinion that a continuous quantity [il continuo] is divisible only into parts which are still further divisible so that however far the division and subdivision be continued no end will be reached; but I am not so certain that they will concede to me that none of these divisions of theirs can be a final one, as is surely the fact, because there always remains "another"; the final and ultimate division is rather one which resolves a continuous quantity into an infinite number of indivisible quantities, a result which I grant can never be reached by successive division into an ever-increasing number of parts.  But if they employ the method which I propose for separating [93] and resolving the whole of infinity [tutta la infinità], at a single stroke (an artifice which surely ought not to be denied me), I think that they would be contented to admit that a continuous quantity is built up out of absolutely indivisible atoms, especially since this method, perhaps better than any other, enables us to avoid many intricate labyrinths, such as cohesion in solids, already mentioned, and the question of expansion and contraction, without forcing upon us the objectionable admission of empty spaces [in solids] which carries with it the penetrability of bodies.  Both of these objections, it appears to me, are avoided if we accept the above-mentioned view of indivisible constituents. 
{{< /l >}}


SIMP.   I hardly know what the Peripatetics would say since the views advanced by you would strike them as mostly new, and as such we must consider them.  It is however not unlikely that they would find answers and solutions for these problems which (49) I, for want of time and critical ability, am at present unable to solve.  Leaving this to one side for the moment, I should like to hear how the introduction of these indivisible quantities helps us to understand contraction and expansion avoiding at the same time the vacuum and the penetrability of bodies. 


{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
I also shall listen with keen interest to this same matter which is far from clear in my mind; provided I am allowed to hear what, a moment ago, Simplicio suggested we omit, namely, the reasons which Aristotle offers against the existence of the vacuum and the arguments which you must advance in rebuttal. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
I will do both.  And first, just as, for the production of expansion, we employ the line described by the small circle during one rotation of the large one -- a line greater than the circumference of the small circle -- so, in order to explain contraction, we point out that, during each rotation of the smaller circle, the larger one describes a straight line which is shorter than its circumference. 

For the better understanding of this we proceed to the consideration of what happens in the case of polygons.  Employing [94] a figure similar to the earlier one, construct the two hexagons, ABC and HIK, about the common center L, and let them roll along the parallel lines HOM and ABc.  Now holding the vertex I fixed, allow the smaller polygon to rotate until the side IK lies upon the parallel, during which motion the point K will describe the arc KM, and the side KI will coincide with IM.  Let us see what, in the meantime, the side CB of the larger polygon has been doing.  Since the rotation is about the point I, the terminal point B, of the line IB, moving backwards, will describe the arc Bb underneath the parallel cA so that when the side KI coincides with the line MI, the side BC will coincide with bc, having advanced only through the distance Bc, but having retreated through a portion of the line BA which subtends the arc Bb.  If we allow the rotation of the smaller polygon to go on it will traverse and describe along its parallel a line equal to its perimeter; while the larger one will traverse and describe a line less than its perimeter by as many times the length bB as there (50) are sides less one; this line is approximately equal to that described by the smaller polygon exceeding it only by the distance bB.  Here now we see, without any difficulty, why the larger polygon, when carried by the smaller, does not measure off with its sides a line longer than that traversed by the smaller one; this is because a portion of each side is superposed upon its immediately preceding neighbor. 

Let us next consider two circles, having a common center at A, and lying upon their respective parallels, the smaller being tangent to its parallel at the point B; the larger, at the point C.  Here when the small circle commences to roll the point B Fig 9 [95]

does not remain at rest for a while so as to allow BC to move backward and carry with it the point C, as happened in the case of the polygons, where the point I remained fixed until the side KI coincided with MI and the line IB carried the terminal point B backward as far as b, so that the side BC fell upon bc, thus superposing upon the line BA, the portion Bb, and advancing by an amount Bc, equal to MI, that is, to one side of the smaller polygon.  On account of these superpositions, which are the excesses of the sides of the larger over the smaller polygon, each net advance is equal to one side of the smaller polygon and, during one complete rotation, these amount to a straight line equal in length to the perimeter of the smaller polygon. 
(51)

But now reasoning in the same way concerning the circles, we must observe that whereas the number of sides in any polygon is comprised within a certain limit, the number of sides in a circle is infinite; the former are finite and divisible; the latter infinite and indivisible.  In the case of the polygon, the vertices remain at rest during an interval of time which bears to the period of one complete rotation the same ratio which one side bears to the perimeter; likewise, in the case of the circles, the delay of each of the infinite number of vertices is merely instantaneous, because an instant is such a fraction of a finite interval as a point is of a line which contains an infinite number of points.  The retrogression of the sides of the larger polygon is not equal to the length of one of its sides but merely to the excess of such a side over one side of the smaller polygon, the net advance being equal to this smaller side; but in the circle, the point or side C, during the instantaneous rest of B, recedes by an amount equal to its excess over the side B, making a net progress equal to B itself.  In short the infinite number of indivisible sides of the greater circle with their infinite number of indivisible retrogressions, made during the infinite number of instantaneous delays of the infinite number of vertices of the smaller circle, together with the infinite number of progressions, equal to the infinite number of sides in the smaller circle -- all these, I say, add up to a line equal to that described by the smaller circle, a line which contains an infinite number of infinitely small superpositions, thus bringing about a thickening or contraction without any overlapping or interpenetration of finite parts.  This result could not be obtained in the case of a line divided [96] into finite parts such as is the perimeter of any polygon, which when laid out in a straight line cannot be shortened except by the overlapping and interpenetration of its sides.  This contraction of an infinite number of infinitely small parts without the interpenetration or overlapping of finite parts and the previously mentioned [p.  70, Nat.  Ed. ] expansion of an infinite number of indivisible parts by the interposition of indivisible vacua is, in my opinion, the most that can be said concerning the contraction (52) and rarefaction of bodies, unless we give up the impenetrability of matter and introduce empty spaces of finite size.  If you find anything here that you consider worth while, pray use it; if not regard it, together with my remarks, as idle talk; but this remember, we are dealing with the infinite and the indivisible.

I frankly confess that your idea is subtle and that it impresses me as new and strange; but whether, as a matter of fact, nature actually behaves according to such a law I am unable to determine; however, until I find a more satisfactory explanation I shall hold fast to this one.  Perhaps Simplicio can tell us something which I have not yet heard, namely, how to explain the explanation which the philosophers have given of this abstruse matter; for, indeed, all that I have hitherto read concerning contradiction is so dense and that concerning expansion so thin that my poor brain can neither penetrate the former nor grasp the latter. 
{{< /r >}}


SIMP.   I am all at sea and find difficulties in following either path, especially this new one; because according to this theory an ounce of gold might be rarefied and expanded until its size would exceed that of the earth, while the earth, in turn, might be condensed and reduced until it would become smaller than a walnut, something which I do not believe; nor do I believe that you believe it.  The arguments and demonstrations which you have advanced are mathematical, abstract, and far removed from concrete matter; and I do not believe that when applied to the physical and natural world these laws will hold. 

SALV.   I am not able to render the invisible visible, nor do I think that you will ask this.  But now that you mention gold, do not our senses tell us that that metal can be immensely expanded? I do not know whether you have observed the method [97] employed by those who are skilled in drawing gold wire, of which really only the surface is gold, the inside material being silver.  The way they draw it is as follows: they take a cylinder or, if you please, a rod of silver, about half a cubit long and three or four times as wide as one's thumb; this rod they cover with gold-leaf which is so thin that it almost floats in air, putting on (53) not more than eight or ten thicknesses.  

Once gilded they begin to pull it, with great force, through the holes of a draw-plate; again and again it is made to pass through smaller and smaller holes, until, after very many passages, it is reduced to the fineness of a lady's hair, or perhaps even finer; yet the surface remains gilded.  Imagine now how the substance of this gold has been expanded and to what fineness it has been reduced. 


SIMP.   I do not see that this process would produce, as a consequence, that marvelous thinning of the substance of the gold which you suggest: first, because the original gilding consisting of ten layers of gold-leaf has a sensible thickness; secondly, because in drawing out the silver it grows in length but at the same time diminishes proportionally in thickness; and, since one dimension thus compensates the other, the area will not be so increased as to make it necessary during the process of gilding to reduce the thinness of the gold beyond that of the original leaves. 

SALV.   You are greatly mistaken, Simplicio, because the surface increases directly as the square root of the length, a fact which I can demonstrate geometrically. 


{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
Please give us the demonstration not only for my own sake but also for Simplicio provided you think we can understand it.
