## LEMMA

Let `ACIB` be the quadrant of a circle. From `B` draw `BE` parallel to `AC`.

Around any point in the line `BE` draw a circle `BOES`, touching `AB` at `B` and intersecting the circumference of the quadrant at `I`.

Join the points `C` and `B`. Draw the line `CI`, prolonging it to `S`.

Then the line `CI` is always less than `CO`. 

Draw the line `AI` touching the circle `BOE`.

Then, if the line `DI` is drawn, it will be equal to `DB`.

But, since `DB` touches the quadrant, `DI` will also be tangent to it and will be at right angles to AI.

Thus `AI` touches the circle BOE at `I`. 

Since the angle AIC is greater than the angle ABC, subtending as it does a larger arc, it follows that the angle SIN is also greater than the angle ABC.

Wherefore the arc IES is greater than the arc BO, and the line CS, being nearer the center, is longer than CB. Consequently CO is greater than CI, since SC:CB=OC:CI.


Fig. 101

This result would be all the more marked if, as in the second figure, the arc BIC were less than a quadrant. For the perpendicular DB would then cut the circle CIB.

And so also would DI which is equal to BD; the angle DIA would be obtuse and therefore the line AIN would cut the circle BIE. Since the angle ABC is less than the angle AIC, which is equal to SIN, and still less than the angle which the tangent at I would make with the line SI, it follows that the arc SEI is far greater than the arc BO; whence, etc.

## Theorem 22, Proposition 36

If from the lowest point of a vertical circle, a chord is drawn subtending an arc not greater than a quadrant, and if from the two ends of this chord two other chords be drawn to any point on the arc, the time of descent along the two latter chords will be shorter than along the first, and shorter also, by the same amount, than along the lower of these two latter chords.

Let CBD be an arc, not exceeding a quadrant, taken from a vertical circle whose lowest point is C; let CD be the chord [planum elevatum] subtending this arc, and let there be two other chords drawn from C and D to any point B on the arc. Then, I say, the time of descent along the two chords [plana] DB and BC is shorter than along DC alone, or along BC alone, starting from rest at B. 

Through the point D, draw the horizontal line MDA cutting CB extended at A: draw DN and MC at right angles to MD, and BN at right angles to BD; about the right-angled triangle DBN describe the semicircle DFBN, cutting DC at F. Choose the point O such that DO will be a mean proportional between CD and DF; in like manner select V so that AV is a mean proportional between CA and AB. Let the length PS represent the time of descent along the whole distance DC or BC, both of which require the same time. Lay off PR such that CD:DO=timePS. timePR. 

Then PR will represent the time in which a body, starting from D, will traverse the distance DF, while RS will measure the time in which the remaining distance, FC, will be traversed. But since PS is also the time of descent, from rest at B, along BC, and if we choose T such that BC:CD=PS:PT then PT will measure the time of descent from A to C, for we have already shown [Lemma] that DC is a mean proportional between AC and CB. 

Finally choose the point G such that CA:AV=PT:PG, then PG will be the time of descent from A to B, while GT will be the residual time of descent along BC following descent from A to B. But, since the diameter, DN, of the circle DFN is a vertical line, the chords DF and DB will be traversed in equal times; wherefore if one can prove that a body will traverse BC, after descent along DB, in a shorter time than it will FC after descent along DF he will have proved the theorem. 

But a body descending from D along DB will traverse BC in the same time as if it had come from A along AB, seeing that the body acquires the same momentum in descending along DB as along AB. 

Hence it remains only to show that descent along BC after AB is quicker than along FC after DF. But we have already shown that GT represents the time along BC after AB; also that RS measures the time along FC after DF. Accordingly it must be shown that RS is greater than GT, which may be done as follows: Since SP:PR=CD:DO, it follows, invertendo et convertendo, that RS:SP=OC:CD; also we have SP:PT=DC:CA. 

Since TP:PG=CA:AV, it follows, invertendo, that PT:TG=AC:CV, therefore, ex Ã¦quali, RS:GT=OC:CV. But, as we shall presently show, OC is greater than CV; hence the time RS is greater than the time GT, which was to be shown. Now, since [Lemma] CF is greater than CB and FD smaller than BA, it follows that CD:DF>CA:AB. But CD:DF=CO:OF, seeing that CD:DO=DO:DF; and CA:AB=CVmacronsup2:VBmacronsup2. Therefore CO:OF>CV:VB, and, according to the preceding lemma, CO>CV. Besides this it is clear that the time of descent along DC is to the time along DBC as DOC is to the sum of DO and CV.

## SCHOLIUM

From the preceding it is possible to infer that the path of quickest descent [lationem omnium velocissimam] from one point to another is not the shortest path, namely, a straight line, but the arc of a circle.

In the quadrant BAEC, having the side BC vertical, divide the arc AC into any number of equal parts, AD, DE, EF, FG, GC, and from C draw straight lines to the points A, D, E, F, G; draw also the straight lines AD, DE, EF, FG, GC. 

Descent along the path ADC is quicker than along AC alone or along DC from rest at D. But a body, starting from rest at A, will traverse DC more quickly than the path ADC; while, if it starts from rest at A, it will traverse the path DEC in a shorter time than DC alone. Hence descent along the three chords, ADEC, will take less time than along the two chords ADC. 

Similarly, following descent along ADE, the time required to traverse EFC is less than that needed for EC alone. Therefore descent is more rapid along the four chords ADEFC than along the three ADEC. And finally a body, after descent along ADEF, will traverse the two chords, FGC, more quickly than FC alone. 

Therefore, along the five chords, ADEFGC, descent will be more rapid than along the four, ADEFC. Consequently the nearer the inscribed polygon approaches a circle the shorter is the time required for descent from A to C.

What has been proven for the quadrant holds true also for smaller arcs; the reasoning is the same.


## Problem 15, Proposition 37

Given a limited vertical line and an inclined plane of equal altitude; it is required to find a distance on the inclined plane which is equal to the vertical line and which is traversed in an interval equal to the time of fall along the vertical line.

Let AB be the vertical line and AC the inclined plane. We must locate, on the inclined plane, a distance equal to the vertical line AB and which will be traversed by a body starting from rest at A in the same time needed for fall along the vertical line. Lay off AD equal to AB, and bisect the remainder DC at I. 

Choose the point E such that AC:CI=CI:AE and lay off DG equal to AE. Clearly EG is equal to AD, and also to AB. And further, I say that EG is that distance which will be traversed by a body, starting from rest at A, in the same time which is required for that body to fall through the distance AB. 

For since AC:CI=CI:AE=ID:DG, we have, convertendo, CA:AI=DI:IG. And since the whole of CA is to the whole of AI as the portion CI is to the portion IG, it follows that the remainder IA is to the remainder AG as the whole of CA is to the whole of AI. 

Thus AI is seen to be a mean proportional between CA and AG, while CI is a mean proportional between CA and AE. If therefore the time of fall along AB is represented by the length AB, the time along AC will be represented by AC, while CI, or ID, will measure the time along AE. 

Since AI is a mean proportional between CA and AG, and since CA is a measure of the time along the entire distance AC, it follows that AI is the time along AG, and the difference IC is the time along the difference GC; but DI was the time along AE. 

Consequently, the lengths DI and IC measure the times along AE and CG respectively. Therefore the remainder DA represents the time along EG, which of course is equal to the time along AB.

## COROLLARY

From this it is clear that the distance sought is bounded at each end by portions of the inclined plane which are traversed in equal times.


## Problem 16, Proposition 38

Given 2 horizontal planes cut by a vertical line, it is required to find a point on the upper part of the vertical line from which bodies may fall to the horizontal planes and there, having their motion deflected into a horizontal direction, will, during an interval equal to the time of fall, traverse distances which bear to each other any assigned ratio of a smaller quantity to a larger.

Let CD and BE be the horizontal planes cut by the vertical ACB, and let the ratio of the smaller quantity to the larger be that of N to FG. It is required to find in the upper part of the vertical line, AB, a point from which a body falling to the plane CD and there having its motion deflected along this plane, will traverse, during an interval equal to its time of fall a distance such that if another body, falling from this same point to the plane BE, there have its motion deflected along this plane and continued during an interval equal to its time of fall, will traverse a distance which bears to the former distance the ratio of FG to N. 

Lay off GH equal to N, and select the point L so that FH:HG=BC:CL. Then, I say, L is the point sought. For, if we lay off CM equal to twice CL, and draw the line LM cutting the plane BE at O, then BO will be equal to twice BL. And since FH:HG=BC:CL, we have, componendo et convertendo, HG:GF=N:GF=CL:LB=CM:BO. 

Since `CM` is double the distance `LC`, the space `CM` is that which a body falling from `L` through `LC` will traverse in the plane `CD`.

For the same reason, since `BO` is twice the distance `BL`, it is clear that BO is the distance which a body, after fall through LB, will traverse during an interval equal to the time of its fall through `LB`.

I think we may concede to our Academician, without flattery, his claim that in the principle [principio, i. e., accelerated motion] laid down in this treatise he has established a new science dealing with a very old subject. 

Observing with what ease and clearness he deduces from a single principle the proofs of so many theorems, I wonder not a little how such a question escaped the attention of Archimedes, Apollonius, Euclid and so many other mathematicians and illustrious philosophers, especially since so many ponderous tomes have been devoted to the subject of motion.

{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
There is a fragment of Euclid which treats of motion, but in it there is no indication that he ever began to investigate the property of acceleration and the manner in which it varies with slope. So that we may say the door is now opened, for the first time, to a new method fraught with numerous and wonderful results which in future years will command the attention of other minds.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
The few properties of the circle proven by Euclid in Elements Book 3 lead to many others more recondite, so the principles which are set forth in this little treatise will, when taken up by speculative minds, lead to many another more remarkable result.

and it is to be believed that it will be so on account of the nobility of the subject, which is superior to any other in nature.

During this long and laborious day, I have enjoyed these simple theorems more than their proofs, many of which, for their complete comprehension, would require more than an hour each; this study, if you will be good enough to leave the book in my hands, is one which I mean to take up at my leisure after we have read the remaining portion which deals with the motion of projectiles; and this if agreeable to you we shall take up tomorrow.
