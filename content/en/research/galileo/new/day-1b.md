Question 1: How are fibres 3 cubits long so tightly bound together in a rope 100 cubits long that great force is required to break it?

<!-- Can you not hold a hempen fibre so tightly between your fingers that I, pulling by the other end, would break it before drawing it away from you?

Certainly you can.  And now when  -->

The fibres of hemp are held at the ends and are grasped by the surrounding medium throughout their entire length.
- Because of this, it is more difficult to tear them loose.

 <!-- from what holds them than to break them?  -->

But in the case of the rope, the act of twisting causes the threads to bind one another.
- When the rope is stretched with a great force, the fibres break rather than separate from each other. 

<!-- At the point where a rope parts, the fibres are very short, nothing like a cubit long, as they would be if the parting of the rope occurred, not by the breaking of the filaments, but by their slipping one over the other.  -->

Ropes sometimes break not by a lengthwise pull but by excessive twisting.

This is because the threads bind one another so tightly.

The compressing fibres do not permit those which are compressed to lengthen the spirals even that little bit by which it is necessary for them to lengthen in order to surround the rope which, on twisting, grows shorter and thicker.

Yes, the thread held between the fingers does not yield even if it is pulled with considerable force.

It resists because it is held back by a double compression: The upper finger presses against the lower as hard as the lower against the upper.

If we could retain only one of these pressures then only half the original resistance would remain.

But since we are not able, by lifting, say, the upper finger, to remove one of these pressures without also removing the other, it becomes necessary to preserve one of them by means of a new device which causes the thread to press itself against the finger or against some other solid body upon which it rests.

Thus, the very force which pulls it in order to snatch it away compresses it more and more as the pull increases.

This is accomplished by wrapping the thread around the solid in the way of a spiral.


Let `AB` and `CD` be 2 cylinders between which is stretched the cord `EF`.

If these 2 cylinders are pressed strongly together, the cord `EF`, when drawn by the end `F`, will stand a considerable pull before it slips between the 2 compressing solids.

But if we remove the cord from one of these cylinders, they will slip freely though remaining in contact with the other.

On the other hand, if one holds the cord loosely against the top of the cylinder `A`, winds it in the spiral form `AFLOTR`, and then pulls it by the end `R`, then the cord will begin to bind the cylinder.

The more spirals, the more tightly will the cord be pressed against the cylinder by any given pull.  

Thus as the number of turns increases, the line of Fig 2 (10) contact becomes longer and in consequence more resistant so that the cord slips and yields to the tractive force with increasing difficulty.

This is precisely the resistance in the thick hemp rope where the fibres form thousands of similar spirals.

The binding effect of these turns is so great. 
- A few short rushes woven together into a few interlacing spirals form one of the strongest of ropes called pack rope [susta].

3 turns of a rope around the axle of a windlass can hold it and prevent it from slipping when pulled by the immense force of the weight which it sustains.

By turning the windlass, this same axle, by mere friction of the rope around it, can wind up and lift huge stones while a mere boy is able to handle the slack of the rope.  

<!-- The other fact has to do with a simple but clever device, invented by a young kinsman of mine, for the purpose of descending from a window by means of a rope without lacerating the palms of his hands, as had happened to him shortly before and greatly to his discomfort.  A small sketch will make this clear.  He took a wooden cylinder, AB, about as thick as a walking stick and about one span long: on this he cut a spiral channel of about one turn and a half, and large enough to just receive the rope which he wished to use.  Having introduced the rope at the end A and led it out again at the end B, he enclosed both the cylinder and the rope in a case of wood or tin, hinged along the side so that it could be easily opened and closed.  After he had fastened the rope to a firm support above, he could, on grasping and squeezing the case with both hands, hang by his arms.  The pressure on the rope, lying between the case and the cylinder, was such that he could, at will, either grasp the case Fig 3 (11) more tightly and hold himself from slipping, or slacken his hold and descend as slowly as he wished.

<!-- A truly ingenious device! I feel, however, that for a complete explanation other considerations might well enter; yet I must not now digress upon this particular topic since you are waiting to hear what I think  -->

I will talk about the breaking strength of other materials which, unlike ropes and most woods, do not have a filamentous structure.

I think that the coherence of these bodies is produced by 2 other causes:

1. The repugnance of nature against a void.

But this repugnance is not sufficient. And so I create cause 2.

<!-- it is necessary to introduce another cause in the form of a gluey or viscous substance which binds firmly together the component parts of the body.  -->

<!-- First I shall speak of the vacuum, demonstrating by definite experiment the quality and quantity of its force [virtÃ¹].   -->

If you take 2 highly polished and smooth plates of marble, metal, or glass and place them face to face, one will slide over the other with the greatest ease.
- This shows that there is nothing of a viscous nature between them.  

But when you try to separate them, the plates exhibit such a repugnance to separation.

The upper one will carry the lower one with it and keep it lifted indefinitely, even when the latter is big and heavy. 

This experiment shows the aversion of nature for empty space, even during the brief moment required for the outside air to rush in and fill up the region between the 2 plates.

{{< i s="/photos/physics/gauge.jpg" a="Gauge Blocks" >}}


It is also observed that if two plates are not thoroughly polished, their contact is imperfect so that when you attempt to separate them slowly the only resistance offered is that of weight; if, however, the pull be sudden, then the lower plate rises, but quickly falls back, having followed the upper plate only for that very short interval of time required for the expansion of the small amount of air remaining between the plates, in consequence of their not fitting, and for the entrance of the surrounding air.  This resistance which is exhibited between the two (12) plates is doubtless likewise present between the parts of a solid, and enters, at least in part, as a concomitant cause of their coherence.
