{{< r a="Simplecio" >}}
Whatever that the earth is more perfect the way it is, being
alterable, changeable, etc., than it would be if it were a mass of stone or even a solid diamond,
and extremely hard and invariant. But to the extent that these conditions bring nobility to the
earth, they would render less perfect the celestial bodies, in which they would be superfluous.
For the celestial bodies -- that is, the sun, the moon, and the other stars, Which are ordained to
have no other use than that of service to the earth -- need nothing more than motion and light
to achieve their end.
{{< /r >}}


SAGR. Has nature, then, produced and directed all these enormous, perfect, and most noble
celestial bodies, invariant, eternal, and divine. for no other purpose than to serve the
changeable, transitory, and mortal earth? To serve that which you call the dregs of the
universe, the sink of all uncleanness? Now to what purpose would the celestial bodies be made
eternal, etc. in order to serve something transitory, etc.? Take away this purpose of serving the
earth, and the innumerable host of celestial bodies is left useless and superfluous, since they
have not and cannot have any reciprocal activities among themselves, all of them being
inalterable, immutable, and invariant. For instance, if the moon is invariant, how would you
have the sun or any other star act upon it? The action would doubtless have no more effect
than an attempt to melt a large mass of gold by looking at it or by thinking about it. Besides, it
seems to me that at such times as the celestial bodies are contributing to the generations and
alterations on the earth, they too must be alterable. Otherwise I do not see how the influence of
the moon or sun in causing generations on the earth would differ from placing a marble statue
beside a woman and expecting children from such a union.



{{< r a="Simplecio" >}}
Corruptibility, alteration, mutation, etc. do not pertain to the whole terrestrial globe,
which as to its entirety is no less eternal than the sun or moon. But as to its external parts it is
generable and corruptible, and it is certainly true that generations and corruptions are perpetual
in those parts, and, as perpetual, that they require celestial and eternal operations. Therefore it
is necessary that celestial bodies be eternal.
{{< /r >}}


SAGR. This is all very well, but if there is nothing prejudicial to the immortality of the entire
terrestrial globe in the corruptibility of its superficial pans, and if this generability,
corruptibility, alterability, etc. give to it a great ornament and perfection, then why can you not
and should you not likewise admit alterations, generations, etc. in the external parts of the
celestial globes, adding these as an ornament without diminishing their perfection or depriving
them of actions; even increasing those by making them operative not only upon the earth but
reciprocally among themselves, and the earth also upon them?


{{< r a="Simplecio" >}}
This cannot be, because the generations, mutations, etc. which would occur, say, on the moon, would be vain and useless, and nature makes nothing in vain.
{{< /r >}}


SAGR. And why should they be vain and useless?


{{< r a="Simplecio" >}}
Because we plainly see and feel that all generations, changes, etc. that occur on earth
are either directly or indirectly designed for the use, comfort, and benefit of man. Horses are
born to accommodate men; for the nutriment of horses, the earth produces hay and the clouds
water it. For the comfort and nourishment of men are created herbs, cereals, fruits, beasts,
birds, and fishes. In brief, if we proceed to examine and weigh carefully all these things, we
shall find that the goal toward which all are directed is the need, the use, the comfort and the
delight of men. Now of what use to the human race could generations ever be which might
happen on the moon or other planets? Unless you mean that there are men also on the moon
who enjoy their fruits; an idea which if not mythical is impious.
{{< /r >}}



SAGR. I do not know nor do I suppose that herbs or plants or animals similar to ours are
propagated on the moon, or that rains and winds and thunderstorms occur there as on the earth;
much less that it is inhabited by men. Yet I still do not see that it necessarily follows that since
things similar to ours are not generated there, no alterations at all take place, or that there
cannot be things there that do change or are generated and dissolve; things not only different
from ours, but so far from our conceptions as to be entirely unimaginable by us.

I am certain that a person born and raised in a huge forest among wild beasts and birds, and
knowing nothing of the watery element, would never be able to frame in his imagination
another world existing in nature differing from his, filled with animals which would travel
without legs or fast beating wings, and not upon its surface alone like beasts upon the earth,
but everywhere within its depths; and not only moving, but stopping motionless wherever they
pleased, a thing which birds in the air cannot do. And that men lived there too, and built
palaces and cities, and traveled with such ease that without tiring themselves at all they could
proceed to far countries with their families and households and whole cities. Now as I say, I
am sure that such a man could not, even with the liveliest imagination, ever picture to himself
fishes, the ocean, ships, fleets, and armadas. Thus, and more so, might it happen that in the
moon, separated from us by so much greater an interval and made of materials perhaps much
different from those on earth, substances exist and actions occur which are not merely remote
from but completely beyond all our imaginings, lacking any resemblance to ours and therefore
being entirely unthinkable. For that which we imagine must be either something already seen
or a composite of things and parts of things seen at different times; such are sphinxes, sirens,
chimeras, centaurs, etc.



{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
Many times have I given rein to my fancies about these things, and my conclusion is
that it is indeed possible to discover some things that do not and cannot exist on the moon, but
none which I believe can be and are there, except very generally; that is, things occupying it,
acting and moving in it, perhaps in a very different way from ours, seeing and admiring the
grandeur and beauty of the universe and of its Maker and Director and continually singing
encomiums in His praise. I mean, in a word, doing what is so frequently decreed in the Holy
Scriptures; namely, a perpetual occupation of all creatures in praising God.
{{< /l >}}


SAGR. These are among the things which, speaking very generally, could be there. But I
should like to hear you mention those which you believe cannot be there, as it must be possible
for you to name them more specifically.

{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
SALV. I warn you, Sagredo, that this will be the third time we have thus strayed imperceptibly,
step by step, from our principal topic, and we shall get to the point of our argument but slowly
if we make digressions. Therefore it will perhaps be good if we defer this matter, along with
others we have agreed to put off until a special session.
{{< /l >}}


SAGR. Please, now that we are on the moon, let us go on with things that pertain to it, so that
we shall not have to make another trip over so long a road....
[Salviati, using data from telescopic observations, describes the features of the moon and its
resemblance to earth: it is spherical, mountainous, and has areas of contrasting brightness.
Simplico argues that the moon is a perfectly smooth sphere made of celestial matter. The three
engage in an extended argument about the nature of the moon.]


{{< r a="Simplecio" >}}
Therefore, in your opinion, the earth would make an appearance similar to that which
we see in the moon, of at most two parts. But do you believe then that those great spots which
are seen on the face of the moon are seas, and the brighter balance land, or some such thing?
