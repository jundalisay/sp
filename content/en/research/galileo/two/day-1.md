We will compare the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic system versus the Copernican system.

Copernicus places the earth among the movable heavenly bodies, making it a globe like a planet.

We will examine the Peripatetic steps in arguing the impossibility of that hypothesis.

what they are, and how great is their force and effect. For this it is necessary to 

We introduce 2 substances which differ essentially:

1. Celestial

This is invariant and eternal

2. Elemental

This is temporary and destructible.

Aristotle explains this in his book De Caelo.

Following the same method, I shall first propound, and then freely speak my opinion, submitting myself to your criticisms -- particularly those of Simplicio, that stout champion and defender of Aristotelian doctrines.

The first step in the Peripatetic arguments is Aristotle's proof of the completeness and perfection of the world. For, he tells us, it is not a mere line, nor a bare surface, but a body having length, breadth, and depth. Since there are only these three dimensions, the world, having these, has them all, and, having the Whole, is perfect. To be sure, I much wish that Aristotle had proved to me by rigorous deductions that simple length constitutes the dimension which we call a line, which by the addition of breadth becomes a surface; that by further adding altitude or depth to this there results a body, and that after these three dimensions there is no passing farther, so that by these three alone, completeness, or, so to speak, wholeness is concluded. Especially since he might have done so very plainly and speedily.

SIMP. What about the elegant demonstrations in the second, third, and fourth texts, after the
definition of "continuous"? Is it not there first proved that there are no more than three
dimensions, since Three is everything, and everywhere? And is this not confirmed by the
doctrine and authority of the Pythagoreans, who say that all things are determined by three --
beginning, middle, and end -- which is the number of the Whole? Also, why leave out another
of his reasons; namely, that this number is used, as if by a law of nature, in sacrifices to the
gods? Furthermore, is it not dictated by nature that we attribute the title of "all" to those things
that are three, and not less? For two are called "both," and one does not say "all" unless there
are three.

You have all this doctrine in the second text. Afterwards, in the third we read, for greater
knowledge that All, and Whole, and Perfect are formally one and the same; and that therefore
among figures only the solid is complete. For it alone is determined by three, which is All;
and, being divisible in three ways, it is divisible in every possible way. Of the other figures,
one is divisible in one way, and the other in two, because they have their divisibility and their
continuity according to the number of dimensions allotted to them. Thus one figure is
continuous in one way, the other in two; but the third, namely the solid, is so in every way.
Moreover, in the fourth text, after some other doctrines, does he not clinch the matter with
another proof? To wit: a transition is made only according to some defect; thus there is a
transition in passing from the line to the surface, because the line is lacking in breadth. But it is
impossible for the perfect to lack anything, being complete in every way; therefore there is no
transition beyond the solid or body to any other figure.

Do you not think that in all these places he has sufficiently proved that there is no passing
beyond the three dimensions, length, breadth, and thickness; and that therefore the body, or
solid, which has them all, is perfect?


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
To tell you the truth, I do not feel impelled by all these reasons to grant any more than
this: that whatever has a beginning, middle, and end may and ought to be called perfect. I feel
no compulsion to grant that the number three is a perfect number, nor that it has a faculty of
conferring perfection upon its possessors. I do not even understand, let alone believe, that with
respect to legs, for example, the number three is more perfect than four or two; neither do I
conceive the number four to be any imperfection in the elements, nor that they would be more
perfect if they were three. Therefore it would have been better for him to leave these subtleties
to the rhetoricians, and to prove his point by rigorous demonstrations such as are suitable to
make in the demonstrative sciences.

SIMP. It seems that you ridicule these reasons, and yet all of them are doctrines to the
Pythagoreans, who attribute so much to numbers. You, who are a mathematician, and who
believe many Pythagorean philosophical opinions, now seem to scorn their mysteries.
SALV. That the Pythagoreans held the science of the human understanding and believed it to
partake of divinity simply because it understood the nature of numbers, I know very well; nor
am I far from being of the same opinion. But that these mysteries which caused Pythagoras
and his sect to have such veneration for the science of numbers are the follies that abound in
the sayings and Writings of the vulgar, I do not believe at all. Rather I know that, in order to
prevent the things they admired from being exposed to the slander and scorn of the common
people, the Pythagoreans condemned as sacrilegious the publication of the most hidden
properties of numbers or of the incommensurable and irrational quantities which they
investigated. 

They taught that anyone who had revealed them was tormented in the other
world. Therefore I believe that some one of them, just to satisfy the common sort and free
himself from their inquisitiveness, gave it out that the mysteries of numbers were those trifles
which later spread among the vulgar. Such astuteness and prudence remind one of the wise
young man who, in order to stop the importunity of his mother or his inquisitive wife -- I
forget which -- who pressed him to impart the secrets of the Senate, made up some story which
afterwards caused her and many other women to be the laughing-stock of that same Senate.
SIMP. I do not want to join the number of those who are too curious about the Pythagorean
mysteries. But as to the point in hand, I reply that the reasons produced by Aristotle to prove
that there are not and cannot be more than three dimensions seem to me conclusive; and I
believe that if a more cogent demonstration had existed, Aristotle would not have omitted it.
SAGR. You might at least add, "if he had known it or if it had occurred to him." Salviati, you
would be doing me a great favor by giving me some effective arguments. if there are any clear
enough to be comprehended by me.

SALV. Not only by you, but by Simplicio too; and not merely comprehended, but already
known -- though perhaps without your realizing it. And to make them easier to understand, let
us take this paper and pen which I see already prepared for such occasions, and draw a few
figures.

First we shall mark these two points, A and B, and draw from one to the other the curved lines
ACB and ADE, and the straight line P3. (Fig. 1) I ask which of them is to your mind the one
that determines the distance between the ends A and B, and why?


{{< r a="Sagredo" >}}
I should say the straight line, and not the curves, because the straight one is shorter and because it is unique, distinct, and determinate; the infinite others are indefinite, unequal, and longer. It seems to me that the choice ought to depend upon that which is unique and definite.
