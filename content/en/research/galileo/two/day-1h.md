SALV. What you are now asking me is the first of the differences that I think exist between the
moon and the earth, which we had better hurry along with, as we are staying too long on the
moon. I say then that if there were in nature only one way for two surfaces to be illuminated
by the sun so that one appears lighter than the other, and that this were by having one made of
land and the other of water, it would be necessary to say that the moon's surface was partly
terrene and partly aqueous. But because there are more ways known to us that could produce
the same effect, and perhaps others that we do not know of, I shall not make bold to affirm one
rather than another to exist on the moon.

We have already seen that a bleached silver plate changes from white to dark by the touch of
the burnisher; the watery part of the earth looks darker than the dry; on the ridges of mountains
the wooded parts look much gloomier than the open and barren places because the plants cast
a great deal of shadow while the clearings are lighted by the sun. Such a mixture of shadows is
so effective that in sculptured velvet the color of the cut silk looks much darker than that of the
uncut, because of shadows cast between one thread and another; and plain velvet is likewise
much darker than taffeta made of the same silk. So if on the moon there were things
resembling dense forests, their aspect would probably be like that of the spots we see; a like
difference would be created if they were seas; and, finally, there is nothing to prevent these
spots being really of a darker color than the rest, for it is in that way that snow makes
mountains appear brighter.

What is clearly seen in the moon is that the darker parts are all plains, with few rocks and
ridges in them, though there are some. The brighter remainder is all fill of rocks, mountains,
round ridges, and other shapes, and in particular there are great ranges of mountains around
the spots. That the spots are flat surfaces we are certain, from observing that the boundary
which separates the light and dark parts makes an even cut in traversing the spots, whereas in
the bright parts it looks broken and jagged. But I do not know whether this evenness of surface
is enough by itself to cause the apparent darkness, and I rather think not.

Quite apart from this, I consider the moon very different from the earth. Though I fancy to
myself that its regions are not idle and dead, still I do not assert that life and motion exist
there, and much less that plants, animals, or other things similar to ours are generated there.
Even if they were, they would be extremely diverse, and far beyond all our imaginings. I am
inclined to believe this because in the first place I think that the material of the lunar globe is
not land and water, and this alone is enough to prevent generations and alterations similar to
ours. But even supposing land and water on the moon, there are in any case two reasons that
plants and animals similar to ours would not be produced there.

The first is that the varying aspects of the sun are so necessary for our various species that
these could not exist at all without them. Now the behavior of the sun toward the earth is much
different from that which it displays toward the moon. As to daily illumination, we on the
earth have for the most part twenty -- four hours divided between day and night, but the same
effect takes a month on the moon. The annual sinking and rising by which the sun causes the
various seasons and the inequalities of day and night are finished for the moon in a month.


And whereas for us the sun rises and sinks so much that between its maximum and minimum
altitudes there lie forty -- seven degrees of difference (that is, as much as the distance between
the tropics), for the moon it varies no more than ten degrees or a little less, which is the
amount of the maximum latitudes of its orbit with respect to the ecliptic.
Now think what the action of the sun would be in the torrid zone if for fifteen days without
pause it continued to beat down with its rays. It goes without saying that all the plants and
herbs and animals would be destroyed; hence if any species existed there, they would be plants
and animals very different from present ones.

In the second place, I am sure that there are no rains on the moon, because if clouds collected
in any part of it, as around the earth, they would hide some of the things on the moon that we
see with the telescope. Briefly, the scene would alter in some respect; an effect which I have
never seen during long and diligent observations, having always discovered a very pure and
uniform serenity.



SAGR. To this it might be replied that either there might be great dews or that it rains there
during its nights; that is, when the sun does not light it up.
SALV. If from other appearances we had any signs that there were species similar to ours
there, and only the occurrence of rains was lacking, we should be able to find this or some
other condition to take their place, as happens in Egypt by the inundations of the Nile. But
finding no event whatever like ours, of the many that would be required to produce similar
effects, there is no point in troubling to introduce one only, and even that one not from sure
observation but because of mere possibility. Besides, if I were asked what my basic knowledge
and natural reason told me regarding the production there of things similar to or different from
ours, I should always reply, "Very different and entirely unimaginable by us"; for this seems to
me to fit with the richness of nature and the omnipotence of the Creator and Ruler.
SAGR. It always seems to me extreme rashness on the part of some when they want to make
human abilities the measure of what nature can do. On the contrary, there is not a single effect
in nature, even the least that exists, such that the most ingenious theorists can arrive at a
complete understanding of it. This vain presumption of understanding everything can have no
other basis than never understanding anything. For anyone who had experienced just once the
perfect understanding of one single thing, and had truly tasted how knowledge is
accomplished, would recognize that of the infinity of other truths he understands nothing.


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
Your argument is quite conclusive; in confirmation of it we have the evidence of those
who do understand or have understood some thing; the more such men have known, the more
they have recognized and freely confessed their little knowledge. And the wisest of the
Greeks, so adjudged by the oracle, said openly that he recognized that he knew nothing.
{{< /l >}}



{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
Either the oracle or Socrates himself was a liar, the former declaring him the wisest, and the latter saying he knew himself the most ignorant.
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
Neither of your alternatives follows, since both pronouncements can be true. The oracle judges Socrates wisest above all other men, whose wisdom is limited; Socrates recognizes his knowing nothing relative to absolute wisdom which is infinite. And since much is the same part of infinite as little, or as nothing (for to arrive at an infinite number it makes no difference whether we accumulate thousands, tens, or zeros), Socrates did well to recognize his limited knowledge to be as nothing to the infinity which he lacked. But since there is nevertheless some knowledge to be found among men, and this is not equally distributed to all, Socrates could have had a larger share than others and thus have verified the response of the oracle. 
{{< /l >}}


SAGR. I think I understand this point quite well. Among men there exists the power to act, Simplicio, but it is not equally shared by all; and no doubt the power of an emperor is greater than that of a private person, but both are nil in comparison to Divine omnipotence. Among men there are some who understand agriculture better than others; but what has knowing how to plant a grapevine in a ditch got to do with knowing how to make it take root, draw nourishment, take from this some part good for building leaves, some other for forming tendrils, this for the bunches, that for the grapes, the other for the skins, all this being the work of most wise Nature? This is one single particular example of the innumerable works of Nature, and in this alone may be recognized an infinite wisdom; hence one may conclude that Divine wisdom is infinitely infinite.



{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
Here is another example. Do we not say that the art of discovering a beautiful statue in a block of marble has elevated the genius of Michelangelo far, far above the ordinary minds of other men? Yet this work is nothing but the copying of a single attitude and position of the external and superficial members of one motionless man. Then what is it in comparison with a man made by Nature, composed of so many members, external and internal, of so many muscles, tendons, nerves, bones, that serve so many and such diverse motions? 

What shall we say of the senses, of spiritual power, and finally of the understanding? May we not rightly say that the making of a statue yields by an infinite amount to the formation of a live man, even to the formation of the lowest worm?
{{< /l >}}


SAGR. And what difference do you think there was between the dove of Archytas and a
natural dove?



{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
Either I am without understanding or there is a manifest contradiction in this argument of yours. Among your greatest encomiums, if not indeed the greatest of all, is your praise for the understanding which you attribute to natural man. A little while ago you agreed with Socrates that his understanding was nil. Then you must say that not even Nature understood how to make an intellect that could understand.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
You put the point very sharply, and to answer the objection it is best to have recourse to a philosophical distinction and to say that the human understanding can be taken in two modes, the intensive or the extensive. Extensively, that is, with regard to the multitude of intelligibles, which are infinite, the human understanding is as nothing even if it understands a thousand propositions; for a thousand in relation to infinity is zero.

But taking man's understanding intensively, in so far as this term denotes understanding some proposition perfectly, I say that the human intellect does understand some of them perfectly, and thus in these it has as much absolute certainty as Nature itself has. Of such are the mathematical sciences alone; that is, geometry and arithmetic, in which the Divine intellect indeed knows infinitely more propositions, since it knows all. But with regard to those few which the human intellect does understand, I believe that its knowledge equals the Divine in objective certainty, for here it succeeds in understanding necessity, beyond which there can be no greater sureness.

These are very ordinary propositions and far from any shade of temerity or boldness. They do not detract in the least from the majesty of Divine wisdom, just as saying that God cannot undo what is done does not in the least diminish His omnipotence. But I question, Simplicio, whether your suspicion does not arise from your having taken my words equivocally. So in order to explain myself better, I say that as to the truth of the knowledge which is given by mathematical proofs, this is the same that Divine wisdom recognizes; but I shall concede to you indeed that the way in which God knows the infinite propositions of which we know some few is exceedingly more excellent than ours.

Our method proceeds with reasoning by steps from one conclusion to another, while His is one of simple intuition. We, for example, in order to win a knowledge of some properties of the circle (which has an infinity of them), begin with one of the simplest, and, taking this for the definition of circle, proceed by reasoning to another property, and from this to a third, and then a fourth, and so on; but the Divine intellect, by a simple apprehension of the circle's essence, knows without time‹consuming reasoning all the infinity of its properties. Next, all these properties are in effect virtually included in the definitions of all things; and ultimately, through being infinite, are perhaps but one in their essence and in the Divine mind.

Nor is all the above entirely unknown to the human mind either, but it is clouded with deep and thick mists, which become partly dispersed and clarified when we master some conclusions and get them so firmly established and so readily in our possession that we can run over them very rapidly. For, after all, what more is there to the square on the hypotenuse being equal to the squares on the other two sides, than the equality of two parallelograms on equal bases and between parallel lines? And is this not ultimately the same as the equality of two surfaces which when superimposed are not increased, but are enclosed within the same boundaries?

These advances, which our intellect makes laboriously and step by step, run through the Divine mind like light in an instant; which is the same as saying that everything is always present to it. I conclude from this that our understanding, as well in the manner as in the number of things understood, is infinitely surpassed by the Divine; but I do not thereby abase it so much as to consider it absolutely null. No, when I consider what marvelous things and how many of them men have understood, inquired into, and contrived, I recognize and understand only too clearly that the human mind is a work of God's, and one of the most excellent.
{{< /l >}}


SAGR. I myself have many times considered in the same vein what you are now saying, and how great may be the acuteness of the human mind. And when I run over the many and marvelous inventions men have discovered in the arts as in letters, and then reflect upon my own knowledge, I count myself little better than miserable. I am so far from being able to promise myself, not indeed the finding out of anything new, but even the learning of what has already been discovered, that I feel stupid and confused, and am goaded by despair.


If I look at some excellent statue, I say within my heart: "When will you be able to remove the excess from a block of marble and reveal so lovely a figure hidden therein? When will you know how to mix different colors and spread them over a canvas or a wall and represent all visible objects by their means, like a Michelangelo, a Raphael, or a Titian?" Looking at what men have found out about arranging the musical intervals and forming precepts and rules in order to control them for the wonderful delight of the ear, when shall T be able to cease my amazement? What shall I say of so many and such diverse instruments? With what admiration the reading of excellent poets fills anyone who attentively studies the invention and interpretation of concepts And what shall I say of architecture? What of the art of navigation?


But surpassing all stupendous inventions, what sublimity of mind was his who dreamed of finding means to communicate his deepest thoughts to any other person, though distant by mighty intervals of place and time! Of talking with those who are in India; of speaking to those who are not yet born and will not he born for a thousand or ten thousand years; and with what facility, by the different arrangements of twenty characters upon a page!

Let this be the seal of all the admirable inventions of mankind and the close of our discussions
for this day. The honest hours now being past, I think that Salviati might like to enjoy our cool
ones in a gondola; and tomorrow I shall expect you both so that we may continue the
discussions now begun.
