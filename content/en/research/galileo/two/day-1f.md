To tell the truth, I have not made such long and careful observations that I can qualify as an authority on the facts of this matter; but certainly I wish to do so, and then to see whether I can once more succeed in reconciling what experience presents to us with what Aristotle teaches.

For obviously two truths cannot contradict one another.

Whenever you wish to reconcile what your senses show you with the soundest
teachings of Aristotle, you will have no trouble at all. Does not Aristotle say that because of the great distance, celestial matters cannot be treated very definitely?

Does he not also declare that what sensible experience shows ought to be preferred over any argument, even one that seems to be extremely well founded? And does he not say this positively and without a bit of hesitation?

Then of the two propositions, both of them Aristotelian doctrines, the second -- which says it is necessary to prefer the senses over arguments -- is a more solid and definite doctrine than the other, which holds the heavens to be inalterable. 

Therefore it is better Aristotelian philosophy to say "Heaven is alterable because my senses tell me so," than to say, "Heaven is inalterable because Aristotle was so persuaded by reasoning. Add to this that we possess a better basis for reasoning about celestial things than Aristotle did.

He admitted such perceptions to be very difficult for him by reason of the distance from his senses, and conceded that one whose senses could better represent them would be able to philosophize about them with more certainty. 

Now we, thanks to the telescope, have brought the heavens 30 or 40 times closer to us than they were to Aristotle, so that we can discern many things in them that he could not see; among other things these sunspots, which were absolutely invisible to him. Therefore we can treat of the heavens and the sun more confidently than Aristotle could.

Aristotle has great authority universally. The other sciences base most of their value and reputation on Aristotle's credit.

Simplicio is confused and perplexed, and I seem to hear him say, "Who would there be to settle our controversies if Aristotle were to be deposed? 

What other author should we follow in the schools, the academies, the universities? 

What philosopher has written the whole of natural philosophy, so well arranged, without omitting a single conclusion? Ought we to desert that structure under which so many travelers have recuperated?

Should we destroy that haven, that Prytaneum (note: Greek public hall where statesmen, heroes, and dignitaries were honored and entertained.) where so many scholars have taken refuge so comfortably; where, without exposing themselves to the inclemencies of the air, they can acquire a complete knowledge of the universe by merely turning over a few pages? 

Should that fort be leveled where one may abide in safety against all enemy assaults?"

I pity him no less than I should some fine gentleman who, having built a magnificent palace at great trouble and expense, employing hundreds and hundreds of artisans, and then beholding it threatened with ruin because of poor foundations, should attempt, in order to avoid the grief of seeing the walls destroyed, adorned as they are with so many lovely murals; or the columns fall, which sustain the superb galleries, or the gilded beams; or the doors spoiled, or the pediments and the marble cornices, brought in at so much cost -- should attempt, I say, to prevent the collapse with chains, props, iron bars, buttresses, and shores.

Simplicio need not yet fear any such collapse; I undertake to insure him against
damage at a much smaller cost. There is no danger that such a multitude of great, subtle, and
wise philosophers will allow themselves to be overcome by one or two who bluster a bit.
Rather, without even directing their pens against them, by means of silence alone, they place
them in universal scorn and derision. 

It is vanity to imagine that one can introduce a new
philosophy by refining this or that author, It is necessary first to teach the reform of the human
mind and to render it capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood, which only God can do.
But where have we strayed, going from one argument to another? I shall not be able to get
back to the path without guidance from your memory.

I remember quite well. We were dealing with the reply of the Anti-Tycho to the
objections against the immutability of the heavens. Among these you brought in this matter of
the sunspots, not mentioned by its author, and I believe you wished to give consideration to his
reply in the case of the new stars.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
In the counter argument of the Anti-Tycho there are some things that ought to be criticized. First of all, if the
two new stars, which that author can do no less than place in the highest regions of heaven,
and which existed a long time and finally vanished, caused him no anxiety about insisting
upon the inalterability of heaven simply because they were not unquestionably parts of heaven
or mutations in the ancient stars, then to what purpose does he make all this fuss and bother
about getting the comets away from the celestial regions at all costs? Would it not have been
enough for him to say that they are not unquestionably parts of heaven and not mutations in
the ancient stars, and hence that they do not prejudice in any way either the heavens or the
doctrines of Aristotle?

In the second place I am not satisfied about his state of mind when he admits that any
alterations which might be made in the stars would be destructive of the celestial prerogatives
of incorruptibility, etc., since the stars are celestial things, as is obvious and as everybody
admits, and when on the other hand he is not the least perturbed if the same alterations take
place elsewhere in the expanse of heaven outside the stars themselves. Does he perhaps mean
to imply that heaven is not a celestial thing? I should think that the stars were called celestial
things because of their being in the heavens, or because of their being made of heavenly
material, and that therefore the heavens would be even more celestial than they; I could not
say similarly that anything was more terrestrial than earth itself, or more igneous than fire.
Next, his not having made mention of the sunspots, which are conclusively proved to be
produced and dissolved and to be situated next to the body of the sun and to revolve with it or
in relation to it, gives me a good indication that this author may write more for the comforting
of others than from his own convictions. I say this because he shows himself to be acquainted
with mathematics, and it would be impossible for him not to be convinced by the proofs that
such material is necessarily contiguous to the sun and undergoes generations and dissolutions
so great that nothing of comparable size has ever occurred on earth. And if the generations and
corruptions occurring on the very globe of the sun are so many, so great, and so frequent,
while this can reasonably be called the noblest part of the heavens, then what argument
remains that can dissuade us from believing that others take place on the other globes?
{{< /l >}}


SAGR. I cannot without great astonishment -- I might say without great insult to my
intelligence -- hear it attributed as a prime perfection and nobility of the natural and integral
bodies of the universe that they are invariant, immutable, inalterable, etc., while on the other
hand it is called a great imperfection to be alterable, generable, mutable, etc. For my part I
consider the earth very noble and admirable precisely because of the diverse alterations,
changes, generations, etc. that occur in it incessantly. If, not being subject to any changes, it
were a vast desert of sand or a mountain of jasper, or if at the time of the flood the waters
which covered it had frozen, and it had remained an enormous globe of ice where nothing was
ever born or ever altered or changed, I should deem it a useless lump in the universe, devoid of
activity and, in a word, superfluous and essentially nonexistent. This is exactly the difference
between a living animal and a dead one; and I say the same of the moon, of Jupiter, and of all
other world globes.

The deeper I go in considering the vanities of popular reasoning, the lighter and more foolish I
find them. What greater stupidity can be imagined than that of calling jewels, silver, and gold
"precious," and earth and soil "base"? People who do this ought to remember that if there were
as great a scarcity of soil as of jewels or precious metals, there would not be a prince who
would not spend a bushel of diamonds and rubies and a cartload of gold just to have enough
earth to plant a jasmine in a little pot, or to sow an orange seed and watch it sprout, grow, and
produce its handsome leaves, its fragrant flowers, and fine fruit. It is scarcity and plenty that
make the vulgar take things to be precious or worthless; they call a diamond very beautiful
because it is like pure water, and then would not exchange one for ten barrels of water. Those
who so greatly exalt incorruptibility, inalterability, etc. are reduced to talking this way, I
believe, by their great desire to go on living, and by the terror they have of death. They do not
reflect that if men were immortal, they themselves would never have come into the world.
Such men really deserve to encounter a Medusa's head which would transmute them into
statues of jasper or of diamond, and thus make them more perfect than they are.
SALV. Maybe such a metamorphosis would not be entirely to their disadvantage, for I think it
would be better for them not to argue than to argue on the wrong side.
