I shall willingly pause, for I run the same risk too, and am on the verge of getting
shipwrecked. At present I sail between rocks and boisterous waves that are making me lose my
bearings, as they say. Therefore, before I multiply your difficulties, propound them.

[Discussion of earth's place in the solar system:]

I see we are once more going to engulf ourselves in a boundless sea from which there is no getting out, ever. 

This is navigating without compass, stars, oars, or rudder, in which we must needs either pass from bank to bank or run aground, or sail forever lost. If, as you suggested, we are to get on with our main subject, it is necessary for the present to put aside the general question whether straight motion is necessary in nature and is proper to some bodies, and proceed to demonstrations, observations, and particular experiments. First we must propound all those that have been put forward to prove the earth's stability by Aristotle, Ptolemy, and others, trying next to resolve them. Finally we must produce those by which a person may become persuaded that the earth, no less than the moon or any other planet, is to be numbered among the natural bodies that move circularly.

SAGR. I submit to the latter more willingly, as I am better satisfied with your architectonic
and general discourse than with that of Aristotle. For yours satisfies me without the least
misgiving, while the other blocks me in some way at every turn. Nor do I know why Simplicio
should not be quickly satisfied with the argument you put forward to prove that motion in a
straight line can have no place in nature, so long as we suppose the parts of the universe to be
disposed in the best arrangement and perfectly ordered.


{{< l a="Salviati" >}}
Stop there, Sagredo. for now a way occurs to me in which Simplicio may be given
satisfaction, provided only that he does not wish to stay so closely tied to every phrase of
Aristotle's as to hold it sacrilege to depart from a single one of them.
There is no doubt that to maintain the optimum placement and perfect order of the parts of the
universe as to local situation, nothing will do but circular motion or rest. As to motion by a
straight line, I do not see how it can be of use for anything except to restore to their natural
location such integral bodies as have been accidentally removed and separated from their
whole, as we have just said.

Let us now consider the whole terrestrial globe, and let us see what can happen to make it and
the other world bodies keep themselves in the natural and best disposition. One must either say
that it is at rest and remains perpetually immovable in its place, or else that it stays always in
its place but revolves itself, or finally that it goes about a center, moving along the
circumference of a circle. Of these events, Aristotle and Ptolemy and all their followers say
that it is the first which has always been observed and which will be forever maintained; that
is, perpetual rest in the same place. Now why, then, should they not have said from the start
that its natural property is to remain motionless, rather than making its natural motion
downward, a motion with which it never did and never will move? 

As to motion by a
straight line, let it be granted to us that nature makes use of this to restore particles of earth,
water, air, fire, and every other integral mundane body to their whole, when any of them find
themselves separated and transported into some improper place unless this restoration can also
be made by finding some more appropriate circular motion. It seems to me that this original
position fits all the consequences much better, even by Aristotle's own method, than to
attribute straight motion as an intrinsic and natural principle of the elements. This is obvious;
for let me ask the Peripatetic if, being of the opinion that celestial bodies are incorruptible and
eternal, he believes that the terrestrial globe is not so, but corruptible and mortal, so that there
will come a time when, the sun and moon and other stars continuing their existence and their
operations, the earth will not be found in the universe but will be annihilated along with the
rest of the elements, and I am certain that he would answer, No. Therefore generation and
corruption belong to the parts and not to the whole; indeed, to very small and superficial parts
which are insensible in comparison to the whole mass. Now since Aristotle argues generation
and corruption from the contrariety of straight motions, let us grant such motions to the parts,
which alone change and decay. But to the whole globe and sphere of the elements will be
ascribed either circular motion or perpetual continuance in its proper place -- the only
tendencies fined for the perpetuation and maintenance of perfect order.

What is thus said of earth may be said as reasonably of fire and of the greater part of the air, to
which elements the Peripatetics are forced to assign as an intrinsic and natural motion one with
which they were never moved and never will be, and to abolish from nature that motion with
which they move, have moved, and are to be moved perpetually. I say this because they assign
an upward motion to air and fire, which is a motion that never belongs to the said elements, but
only to some of their particles -- and even then only to restore them to perfect arrangement
when they are out of their natural places. On the other hand, they call circular motion (with
which they are incessantly moved) preternatural to them, forgetting what Aristotle has said
many times, that nothing violent can last very long.

{{< r a="Simplicio" >}}
To all these things we have the most suitable answers, which I omit for the present in order that we may come to the particular reasons and sensible experiments which should be finally preferred, as Aristotle well says, above anything that can be supplied by human argument.

SAGR. Then what has been said up to now will serve to place under consideration which of
two general arguments has the more probability. 

First there is that of Aristotle, who would
persuade us that sublunar bodies are by nature generable and corruptible, etc., and are
therefore very different in essence from celestial bodies, these being invariant, ingenerable,
incorruptible, etc. This argument is deduced from differences of simple motions. 

Second is
that of Salviati, who assumes the integral parts of the world to be disposed in the best order,
and as a necessary consequence excludes straight motions for simple natural bodies as being of
no use in nature; he takes the earth to be another of the celestial bodies, endowed with all the
prerogatives that belong to them. The latter reasoning suits me better up to this point than the
other. Therefore let Simplicio be good enough to produce all the specific arguments,
experiments, and observations, both physical and astronomical, by which one may be fully
persuaded that the earth differs from the celestial bodies, is immovable, and is located in the
center of the universe, or anything else that would exclude the earth from being movable like a
planet such as Jupiter, or the moon, etc. And you, Salviati, have the kindness to reply step by
step.
