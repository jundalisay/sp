<!-- The open-minded and lettered Sagredo in Galileo's dialogue was a close friend of the scientist.

Salviati represents the views of Galileo himself. Simplicio, the philosopher, is a fictitious straw man. -->

Several years ago there was published in Rome a salutary edict which, in order to obviate the
dangerous tendencies of our present age, imposed a seasonable silence upon the Pythagorean
opinion that the earth moves There were those who impudently asserted that this decree had its
origin not injudicious inquire, but in passion none too well informed Complaints were to be
heard that advisers who were totally unskilled at astronomical observations ought not to clip
the wings of reflective intellects by means of rash prohibitions.

Upon hearing such carping insolence, my zeal could not be contained. Being thoroughly
informed about that prudent determination, I decided to appear openly in the theater of the
world as a witness of the sober truth. I was at that time in Rome; I was not only received by
the most eminent prelates of that Court, but had their applause; indeed this decree was not
published without some previous notice of it having been given to me. Therefore I propose in
the present work to show to foreign nations that as much is understood of this matter in Italy,
and particularly in Rome, as transalpine diligence can ever have imagined Collecting all the
reflections that properly concern the Copernican system, I shall make it known that everything
was brought before the attention of the Roman censorship, and that there proceed from this
clime not only dogmas for the welfare of the soul, but ingenious discoveries for the delight of
the mind as well.

To this end I have taken the Copernican side in the discourse, proceeding as with a pure
mathematical hypothesis and striving by every artipee to represent it as superior to supposing
the earth motionlessâ€“not, indeed absolutely, but as against the arguments of some professed
Peripatetics. These men indeed deserve not even that name, for they do not walk about; they
are content to adore the shadows, philosophizing not with due circumspection but merely from
having memorized a few ill-understood principles.

Three principal headings are treated First, I shall try to show that all experiments practicable
upon the earth are insufficient measures for proving its mobility, since they are indiferently
adaptable to an earth in motion or at rest. I hope in so doing to reveal many observations
unknown to the ancients. Secondly, the celestial phenomena will be examined strengthening
the Copernican hypothesis until it might seem that this must triumph absolutely. Here new
reflections are adjoined which might be used in order to simplfy astronomy, though not
because of any necessity imported by nature. In the third place, I shall propose an ingenious
speculation. It happens that long ago I said that the unsolved problem of the ocean tides might
receive some light from assuming the motion of the earth. This assertion of mine, passing by
word of mouth, found loving fathers who adopted it as a child of their own ingenuity. Now, so
that no stranger may ever a who, arming himself with our weapons, shall charge us with want
of attention to such an important matter, I have thought it good to reveal those probabilities
which might render this plausible, given that the earth moves.

I hope that from these considerations the world will come to know that if other nations have
navigated more, we have not theorized less. It is not from failing to take count of what others
have thought that we have yielded to asserting that the earth is motionless, and holding the
contrary to be a mere mathematical caprice, but (if for nothing else) for those reasons that are
supplied by piety, religion, the knowledge of Divine Omnipotence, and a consciousness of the
limitations of the human mind I have thought it most appropriate to explain these concepts in
the form of dialogues, which, no! being restricted to the rigorous observance of mathematical
laws, make room also for digressions which are sometimes no less interesting than the
principal argument.

Many years ago I was often to be found in the marvelous city of Venice, in discussions with
Signore Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, a man of noble extraction and trenchant wit. Prom
Florence came Signore Filippo Salviati, the least of whose glories were the eminence of his
blood and the magnificence of his fortune. His was a sublime intellect which fed no more
hungrily upon any pleasure than it did upon fine meditations. I often talked with these two of
such matters in the presence of a certain Peripatetic philosopher whose greatest obstacle in
apprehending the truth seemed to be the reputation he had acquired by his interpretations of
Aristotle.

Now, since bitter death has deprived Venice and Florence of those two great luminaries in the
very meridian of their years, I have resolved to make their fame live on in these pages, so far
as my poor abilities will permit, by introducing them as interlocutors in the present argument.
(Nor shall the good Peripatetic lack a place; because of his excessive affection toward the
Commentaries of Simplicius,I have thought fit to leave him under the name of the author he so
much revered, without mentioning his own) May it please those two great souls, ever venerable
to my heart, to accept this public monument of my undying love. And may the memory of their
eloquence assist me in delivering to posterity the promised reflections.
It happened that several discussions had taken place casually at various times among these
gentlemen, and had rather whetted than satisfied their thirst for learning. Hence very wisely
they resolved to meet together on certain days during which, setting aside all other business,
they might apply themselves more methodically to the contemplation of the wonders of God in
the heavens and upon the earth. They met in the palace of the illustrious Sagredo; and, after
the customary but brief exchange of compliments, Saiviati commenced as follows.
