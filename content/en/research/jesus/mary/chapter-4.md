. . . Will matter then be destroyed or not?

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>22</sup> All nature, all formations, all creatures exist in and with one another. They will be resolved again into their own roots.

<sup>23</sup> For the nature of matter is resolved into the roots of its own nature alone.

<sup>24</sup> He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
{{< /l >}}



{{< r a="Peter" >}}
<sup>25</sup> Since you have explained everything to us, tell us: What is the sin of the world?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
<sup>26</sup> There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin.

<sup>27</sup> That is why the Good came into your midst, to the essence of every nature in order to restore it to its root.

<sup>28</sup> That is why you become sick and die, for you are deprived of the one who can heal you.

<sup>29</sup> He who has a mind to understand, let him understand.

<sup>30</sup> Matter gave birth to a passion that has no equal, which proceeded from something contrary to nature. Then there arises a disturbance in its whole body.

<sup>31</sup> That is why I said to you, Be of good courage, and if you are discouraged be encouraged in the presence of the different forms of nature.

<sup>32</sup> He who has ears to hear, let him hear.

<sup>33</sup> When the Blessed One had said this, He greeted them all, saying:

{{< l a="Jesus" >}}
Peace be with you. Receive my peace unto yourselves.

<sup>34</sup> Beware that no one lead you astray saying Lo here or lo there! For the Son of Man is within you.

<sup>35</sup> Follow after Him!

<sup>36</sup> Those who seek Him will find Him.

<sup>37</sup> Go then and preach the gospel of the Kingdom.

<sup>38</sup> Do not lay down any rules beyond what I appointed you, and do not give a law like the lawgiver lest you be constrained by it.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>39</sup>When He said this He departed.
