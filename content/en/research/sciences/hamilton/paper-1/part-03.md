An alternative approach, however, shows that the arrays (Sa,>, are
sufficient to define the selective effects. Every effect on reproduction which is
due to A can be thought of as made up of two parts: an effect on the reproduction of genes i.b.d. with genes in A, and an effect on the reproduction of
unrelated genes. Since the coefficient I measures the expected fraction of
genes i.b.d. in a relative, for any particular degree of relationship this breakdown may be written quantitatively:
(~aredA = r(hel.L + Cl- r)(JaredA.
The total of effects on reproduction which are due to A may be treated
similarly :
IX, WreJA = IX, @adA + z, Cl- r) @areA
or
F (h), = F r@& + C Cl- r>(WA,
r
which we rewrite briefly as
6T; = 6Rf4 + 6S,,
where 6Rz is accordingly the total effect on genes i.b.d. in relatives of A,
and SS, is the total effect on their other genes. 

The reason for the omission of an index symbol from the last term is that here there is, in effect, no question of whether or not the self-effect is to be in the summation, for if it is included it has to be multiplied by zero. If index symbols were used  we should have SS~ =SSi, whatever the subscript; it therefore seems more explicit to omit them throughout.

If, therefore, all effects are accounted to the individuals that cause them,
of the total effect 6Ti~ due to an individual of genotype GiGj a part SRG
will involve a specific contribution to the gene-pool by this genotype, while
the remaining part SSij will involve an unspecific contribution consisting of
genes in the ratio in which the gene-pool already possesses them. It is clear
that it is the matrix of effects SRG which determines the direction of selection
progress in gene-frequencies; SSij only influences its magnitude. In view of
this importance of the SRG it is convenient to give some name to the concept
with which they are associated.

In accordance with our convention let
then RG will be called the inclusivefitness, SR,‘, the inclusive fitness efSect and
SSij the diluting effect, of the genotype GiGj.

Let
Tijl= 1+X$.

So far our discussion is valid for non-random mating but from now on for
simplicity we assume that it is random. Using a prime to distinguish the new
gene-frequencies after one generation of selection we have
C Pi PjRTj + Pi C Pj Pk as,,
pf= j
& PjPlcx:
1 PjR$ +,& PjPkSSjk
= pi j
,cxpjikT; ’

The terms of this expression are clearly of the nature of averages over a
part (genotypes containing G,, homozygotes GiGi counted twice) and the
whole of the existing set of genotypes in the population. Thus using a well
known subscript notation we may rewrite the equation term by term as
Rz +6S
p; = pi I’+
T.
or
Ap, = R. Fas. WT. - Rf.1.
.a . .

This form clearly differentiates the roles of the Rz and SSG in selective
progress and shows the appropriateness of calling the latter diluting effects. 

For comparison with the account of the classical case given by Moran (1962), equation (2) may be put in the form
where alapi denotes the usual partial derivative, written dIdpi by Moran.

Whether the selective effect is reckoned by means of the a; or according
to the method above, the denominator expression must take in all effects
occurring during the generation. Hence a.: = T.0.

As might be expected from the greater generality of the present model the
extension of the theorem of the increase of mean fitness (Scheuer & Mandel,
1959 ; Mulholland & Smith, 1959 ; a much shorter proof by Kingman, 1961 a)
presents certain difficulties. However, from the above equations it is clear
that the quantity that will tend to maximize, if any, is R.:, the mean inclusive
fitness. The following brief discussion uses Kingman’s approach.
The mean inclusive fitness in the succeeding generation is given by
RTI =CPIP~R; = ~~~,pipjR~(R:+sS..)(R~j+~S..). i, j a. i,J
. . . R~.'-R~.= AR” = ~~~

+R:@f -R'T;y .
Substituting R.: + SS.. for T-y in the numerator expression, expanding and
rearranging :
Cpipj R~R:R:j-R03 +

GJ 1
+ 26s..
(
C PiPjR~R~.-R~2 .
i,j
We have ( ) > 0 in both cases. The first is the proven inequality of the
classical model. The second follows from
CpiPjRtR: =CpiRyT > (7 piR:)2 = RTf'* 4 j
Thus a sufficient condition for AR.: > 0 is SS.. 3 0. That AR.: > 0 for
positive dilution is almost obvious if we compare the actual selective changes
with those which would occur if {RG} were the fitness matrix in the classical
model.
It follows that R.: certainly maximizes (in the sense of reaching a local
maximum of R.:) if it never occurs in the course of selective changes that
SS.. < 0. Thus R.y certainly maximizes if all SSij > 0 and therefore also if
all (&,,r.)ij > 0. It still does SO even if some or all 6Uij are negative, for, as
we have seen SS, is independant of liaij. 

Here then we have discovered a quantity, inclusive fitness, which under the
conditions of the model tends to maximize in much the same way that fitness
tends to maximize in the simpler classical model. For an important class of
genetic effects where the individual is supposed to dispense benefits to his
neighbours, we have formally proved that the average inclusive fitness in the
population will always increase. For cases where individuals may dispense
harm to their neighbours we merely know, roughly speaking, that the change
in gene frequency in each generation is aimed somewhere in the direction of
a local maximum of average inclusive fitness,? but may, for all the present
analysis has told us, overshoot it in such a way as to produce a lower value.
As to the nature of inclusive fitness it may perhaps help to clarify the
notion if we now give a slightly different verbal presentation.
