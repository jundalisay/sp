<!-- Julien Offray de La Mettrie
1748 -->


<!-- It is not enough for a wise man to study nature and truth; he should dare state truth for the benefit of the few who are willing and able to think. As for the rest, who are voluntarily slaves of prejudice, they can no more attain truth, than frogs can fly. -->

There are 2 systems of philosophy which deal with man's soul:

1. Materialism

This is older.

2. Spiritualism

The metaphysicians who have hinted that matter may well be endowed with the faculty of thought have perhaps not reasoned ill. 

For there is in this case a certain advantage in their inadequate way of expressing their meaning. 

Can matter think?

This is like asking whether matter can tell time.

Locke was wrong in this.

 <!-- had the bad luck to shipwreck. -->

The Leibnizians with their monads have set up an unintelligible hypothesis. 

They have spiritualized matter than materialized the soul. 

How can we define a being whose nature is absolutely unknown to us?

Descartes and all the Cartesians, among whom the followers of Malebranche have long been numbered, have made the same mistake. 

They have taken for granted 2 distinct substances in man, as if they had seen them, and positively counted them.

The wisest men have declared that the soul can not know itself save by the light of faith. 

However, as reasonable beings they have thought that they could reserve for themselves the right of examining what the Bible means by the word ``spirit,'' which it uses in speaking of the human soul. 

If in their investigation, they do not agree with the theologians on this point, are the theologians more in agreement among themselves on all other points?

Here is the result in a few words of all their reflections. 

If there is a God, he is the Author of nature was well as of revelation. He has given us the one to explain the other, and reason to make them agree.

To distrust the knowledge that can be drawn from the study of animated bodies, is to regard nature and revelation as two contraries which destroy each other.

Consequently to dare uphold the absurd doctrine, that God contradicts Himself in His various works and deceives us.

If there is a revelation, it can not then contradict nature. 

By nature only can we understand the meaning of the words of the Gospel, of which experience is the only truly interpreter. 

In fact, the commentators before our time have only obscured the truth. We can judged of this by the author of the Spectacle of Nature. 

{{< q a="Noel-Antoine Pluche" >}}
It is astonishing that Locke degrades our soul far enough to consider it a soul of clay should dare set up reason as judge and sovereign arbiter of the mysteries of faith, for.. what an astonishing idea of Christianity one would have, if one were to follow reason.
{{< /q >}}

These reflections:
- fail to elucidate faith
- are frivolous objections to the method of those who undertake to interpret the Scripture

The excellence of reason does not depend on a big word devoid of meaning (immateriality), but on the force, extent, and perspicuity of reason itself. 

Thus a ``soul of clay'' which should discover, at one glance, as it were, the relations and the consequences of an infinite number of ideas hard to understand, would evidently be preferable to a foolish and stupid soul, though that were composed of the most precious elements. 

A man is not a philosopher because, with Pliny, he blushes over the wretchedness of our origin. 

What seems vile is here the most precious of things, and seems to be the object of nature's highest art and most elaborate care. 

Man comes from a still more lowly source.

He would yet be the most perfect of all beings.

So whatever the origin of his soul, if it is pure, noble, and lofty, it is a beautiful soul which dignifies the man endowed with it.

Pluche's second way of reasoning is vicious to me.

His system is a bit fanatic.

He says that if we have an idea of faith as being contrary to the clearest principles, to the most incontestable truths, we must yet conclude, out of respect for revelation and its author, that this conception is false, and that we do not yet understand the meaning of the words of the Gospel.

Of the two alternatives, only one is possible.

Either everything is illusion, nature as well as revelation, or experience alone can explain faith. 

But that is ridiculous! 

Can one imagine hearing a Peripatetic say, ``We ought not to accept the experiments of Torricelli, for if we should accept them, if we should rid ourselves of the horror of the void, what an astonishing philosophy we should have!''

I shown Pluche's reasoning as vicious in order to prove:

1. If there is a revelation, it is not sufficiently demonstrated by the mere authority of the Church, and without any appeal to reason, as all those who fear reason claim

2. To protect against all assault the method of those who would wish to follow the path that I open to them, of interpreting supernatural things, incomprehensible in themselves, in the light of those ideas with which nature has endowed us. 

Experience and observation should therefore be our only guides here. Both are to be found throughout the records of the physicians who were philosophers, and not in the works of the philosophers who were not physicians. 

The former have traveled through and illuminated the labyrinth of man; they alone have laid bare those springs [of life] hidden under the external integument which conceals so many wonders from our eyes. 

They alone, tranquilly contemplating our soul, have surprised it, a thousand times, both in its wretchedness and in its glory, and they have no more despised it in the first estate, than they have admired it in the second. 

Thus, to repeat, only the physicians have a right to speak on this subject. What could the others, especially the theologians, have to say? 

Is it not ridiculous to hear them shamelessly coming to conclusions about a subject concerning which they have had no means of knowing anything, and from which on the contrary they have been completely turned aside by obscure studies that have led them to a thousand prejudiced opinions, - in a word, to fanaticism, which adds yet more to their ignorance of the mechanism of the body?

But even though we have chosen the best guides, we shall still find many thorns and stumbling blocks in the way.
