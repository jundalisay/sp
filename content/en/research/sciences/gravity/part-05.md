It makes sense to treat gravity differently from the other interactions.

In canonically or perturbatively quantised gravity, the entanglement between matter and its gravitational field can be best understood by what is called a ‘dressing’ in the context
of quantum field theory. This is the formal acknowledgement
that a particle which carries a charge—say, an electron that
carries electric charge—never occurs in nature without the
field created by that charge. 


5 The assumption that particles and geometry are ultimately the same does
not per se require the existence of gravitons. However, I find it hard to
see how one could have geometry with quantum features and not also have
propagating modes, i.e. gravitons.


A bare electron appears only in the mathematics. Real electrons always come with soft (low
energy) photon clouds: This is the dressing.

If one has an electron that is in a superposition of two
branches, then each branch has its own dressing. They are
independent from each other and can have a relative phase.
Consequently, the electron is entangled with the soft photon
dressing. The entanglement in quantum gravity comes about
in the same way: it describes a dressing by soft gravitons that
can then be interpreted as the field caused by the particle, or
the geometric deformation respectively.

In the approach that I started from, however, soft photons
are very different from soft gravitons. The photons are particles and independent of the electrons. The soft gravitons,
however, are not because, by assumption, the particle and its
geometry are ultimately the same. They are the same, that is,
up to freely propagating modes that are hard gravitons.
The reason this makes sense at least to me is that if we
treat the graviton dressing like the photon dressing, then the
mathematical description of a particle in a superposition of
multiple locations carries no information about it in fact being
one particle. There is formally no way we could know that,
say, half an electron with its own dressing is actually not itself
a fundamental particle other than by normalisation. But the
normalisation just tells us that we cannot measure only one
branch in isolation, which is exactly the fact that needs explanation. But half an electron does not exist any more than
an electron without an electric field. To put this differently:
Two branches of one particle are not physically independent
because they cannot exist separately.

The product state requirement can thus be seen as a way
to make sure that it is always entire particles that create a geometry, and this in turn explains why we can only measure
entire particles. In other words, the Hamiltonian constraint
should act per particle sector (of Fock space), and not pointwise. This is why, intuitively, the state of a particle in two
branches has mixed terms that essentially describe part of a
particle in one place with a gravitational field sourced from
another place. This happens exactly because the rest of the
particle must be somewhere.
I know that I did not, in fact, put forward the mathematics for these statements. That is because it would just add assumptions that are unnecessary to arrive at the phenomenological consequences which were the focus of this paper. However, I wanted to provide this explanation as motivation.
It is also worth mentioning that the estimate presented here
does not rest on the product state assumption. By order of
magnitude one would expect most deviations from canonically quantised gravity to give a similar result.

I interpret this model as a way to reconcile the present formalism of quantum mechanics with a possibly underlying theory. The teleology of this model is likely a mathematical artifact that originates in the way that we have developed quantum
mechanics. This is because the teleology of the model presented here ultimately comes from the way that we describe
the initial (prepared) state of the system. But how do we even
know what this state is? We have simply inferred these states
(and their Hamiltonian operators) from the results of countless experiments. We have no evidence that the initial state in
standard quantum mechanics is an ontological state, rather, it
is a reconstruction for the purpose of fitting our measurement
results.

Is it any surprise, then, that if we ask for the local time evolution of such a reconstructed state, we get a model in which
the choice of measurement variable must fit with what happened before the measurement? I think that this odd feature
will make sense once we understand the underlying physics,
just like the electron’s magnetic moment made sense once we
understood what a spin 1/2 particle is.

Finally, I want to stress that nowhere have I assumed that
the geometry is classical. Indeed, in general it is not classical:
The geometry can have superpositions and it can also be internally entangled. It is just that states of the geometry with
significant quantum features will not survive for long because
of the residual build-up.


## 6. SUMMARY

I have shown here how the assumption that matter and geometry have the same fundamental origin requires the time
evolution of a quantum state to differ from the Schrodinger ¨
equation. This has the consequence that the ideal time evolutions which minimise the action are those with end states
that are to good approximation classical. We can then identify
these end states with the eigenstates of the measurement device. This new model therefore explains why quantum states
seem to ‘collapse’ into eigenstates of the measurement observable, and how this can happen while preserving locality.
Since the collapse process is governed by quantum gravitational contributions whose strength is known, the resulting model is parameter free. 

Collapse happens in this model whenever the accumulated phase difference between
dislocated branches, τm|Φ12|, exceeds ∼ 1. The model’s
phenomenology—notably the collapse itself—can be tested in
roughly the same parameter range as other tests of the weak
field limit of quantum gravity.
