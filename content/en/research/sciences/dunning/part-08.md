One puzzling aspect of our results is how the incompetent fail, through life experience, to learn that they are unskilled. 

This is not a new puzzle. 

Sullivan, in 1953, marveled at "the failure of learning which has left their capacity for self-centered delusions unaffected by a life-long history of educative events" (p. 80). 

Our student participants overestimated their standing on academically oriented tests as grammar and logical reasoning.

Our analysis suggests that the incompetent are unable to spot their poor performances themselves.

But one would have thought that they would have gotten negative feedback at some point in their academic career.

So why had they not learned?

1. People seldom accept negative feedback about their skills and abilities from others.

<!--  in everyday life (Blumberg, 1972; Darley & Fazio, 1980; Goffman, 1955; Matlin &
Stang, 1978; Tesser & Rosen, 1975).  -->

<!-- Even young children are familiar with the notion that "if you do not have something nice to
say, don't say anything at all."  -->

2. The bungled robbery attempt of McArthur Wheeler have some tasks and settings precluding him from receiving self-correcting information.

<!--  that would reveal the suboptimal nature of their decisions
(Einhorn, 1982).  -->

3. Even if people receive negative feedback, they still must come to an accurate understanding of why that failure has occurred. 

The problem with failure is that it is subject to more attributional ambiguity than success. 

For success to occur, many things must go right: 
- The person must be skilled
- apply effort
- get lucky

For failure to occur, the lack of any one of these components is sufficient. 

Because of this, even if people receive feedback that points to a lack of skill, they may attribute it to some other factor (Snyder, Higgins, & Stucky, 1983; Snyder, Shenkel, & Lowery, 1977).

Study 3 showed that the incompetent are unable to take full advantage of social comparison feedback. 

People learn their own competence by watching others (Festinger, 1954; Gilbert, Giesler & Morris, 1995). 

In a perfect world, everyone could see the judgments and decisions of others.
- They would accurately assess how competent those decisions are
- They would then revise their view of their own competence by comparison. 

However, Study 3 showed that incompetent individuals are unable to do so.

Compared with their more expert peers, they were less able to spot competence when they saw it, and as a consequence, were less able to learn that their ability estimates were incorrect.

7 These data are based on the absolute miscalibration (regardless of sign) in participants' estimates across the three studies in which both comparative and objective measures of perceived performance were assessed (Studies 2, 3, and 4). 


## Limitations of the Present Analysis

We do not mean that:
- people are always unaware of their incompetence.
- the metacognitive failings of the incompetent are the only reason people overestimate their abilities

<!-- We doubt whether many of our readers would dare take on Michael Jordan in a game of one-on-one, challenge
Eric Clapton with a session of dueling guitars, or enter into a
friendly wager on the golf course with Tiger Woods.  -->

Other factors such as motivational biases, self-serving trait definitions, selective recall of past behavior, and the tendency to ignore the proficiencies of others (Klar, Medding, & Sarel, 1996; Kruger, 1999) also play a role.

Bottom-quartile participants accounted for the bulk of the above-average effects observed in our studies (overestimating their ability by an average of 50 percentile points), there was also a slight tendency for the other quartiles to overestimate themselves (by just over 6 percentile points)-a fact our metacognitive analysis cannot explain.

When can the incompetent be expected to overestimate themselves
because of their lack of skill? Although our data do not speak to this
issue directly, we believe the answer depends on the domain under
consideration. Some domains, like those examined in this article, are
those in which knowledge about the domain confers competence in
the domain. Individuals with a great understanding of the rules of
grammar or inferential logic, for example, are by definition skilled
linguists and logicians. In such domains, lack of skill implies both the
inability to perform competently as well as the inability to recognize
competence, and thus are also the domains in which the incompetent
are likely to be unaware of their lack of skill.

In other domains, however, competence is not wholly dependent
on knowledge or wisdom, but depends on other factors, such as
physical skill. One need not look far to find individuals with an
impressive understanding of the strategies and techniques of basketball, for instance, yet who could not "dunk" to save their lives.
(These people are called coaches.) Similarly, art appraisers make a
living evaluating fine calligraphy, but know they do not possess
the steady hand and patient nature necessary to produce the work
themselves. In such domains, those in which knowledge about the
domain does not necessarily translate into competence in the
domain, one can become acutely-even painfully-aware of the
limits of one's ability. In golf, for instance, one can know all about
the fine points of course management, club selection, and effective
"swing thoughts," but one's incompetence will become sorely
obvious when, after watching one's more able partner drive the
ball 250 yards down the fairway, one proceeds to hit one's own
ball 150 yards down the fairway, 50 yards to the right, and onto the
hood of that 1993 Ford Taurus.

Finally, in order for the incompetent to overestimate themselves,
they must satisfy a minimal threshold of knowledge, theory, or
experience that suggests to themselves that they can generate
correct answers. In some domains, there are clear and unavoidable
reality constraints that prohibits this notion. For example, most
people have no trouble identifying their inability to translate Slovenian proverbs, reconstruct an 8-cylinder engine, or diagnose
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. In these domains, without
even an intuition of how to respond, people do not overestimate
their ability. Instead, if people show any bias at all, it is to rate
themselves as worse than their peers (Kruger, 1999).

## Relation to Work on Overconfidence

The finding that people systematically overestimate their ability
and performance calls to mind other work on calibration in which
people make a prediction and estimate the likelihood that the
prediction will prove correct. Consistently, the confidence with
which people make their predictions far exceeds their accuracy
rates (e.g., Dunning, Griffin, Milojkovic, & Ross, 1990; Vallone,
Griffin, Lin, & Ross, 1990; Lichtenstein, Fischhoff, & Phillips,
1982).

Our data both complement and extend this work. In particular,
work on overconfidence has shown that people are more miscalibrated when they face difficult tasks, ones for which they fail to
possess the requisite knowledge, than they are for easy tasks, ones
for which they do possess that knowledge (Lichtenstein & Fischhoff, 1977). Our work replicates this point not by looking at
properties of the task but at properties of the person. Whether the
task is difficult because of the nature of the task or because the
person is unskilled, the end result is a large degree of
overconfidence.

Our data also provide an empirical rebuttal to a critique that has
been leveled at past work on overconfidence. Gigerenzer (1991)
and his colleagues (Gigerenzer, Hoffrage, & KleinbOlting, 1991)
have argued that the types of probability estimates used in traditional overconfidence work-namely, those concerning the occurrence of single events-are fundamentally flawed. According to
the critique, probabilities do not apply to single events but only to
multiple ones. As a consequence, if people make probability
estimates in more appropriate contexts (such as by estimating the
total number of test items answered correctly), "cognitive illusions" such as overconfidence disappear. Our results call this
critique into question. Across the three studies in which we have
relevant data, participants consistently overestimated the number
of items they had answered correctly, Z = 4.94, p < .0001.

## Concluding Remarks

In sum, we present this article as an exploration into why people
tend to hold overly optimistic and miscalibrated views about
themselves. We propose that those with limited knowledge in a
domain suffer a dual burden: Not only do they reach mistaken
conclusions and make regrettable errors, but their incompetence
robs them of the ability to realize it. Although we feel we have
done a competent job in making a strong case for this analysis,
studying it empirically, and drawing out relevant implications, our
thesis leaves us with one haunting worry that we cannot vanquish.
That worry is that this article may contain faulty logic, methodological errors, or poor communication. Let us assure our readers
that to the extent this article is imperfect, it is not a sin we have
committed knowingly.
