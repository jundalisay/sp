## Study 1: Humor

In Study 1, we decided to explore people's perceptions of their competence in a domain that requires sophisticated knowledge and wisdom about the tastes and reactions of other people. That domain was humor. 

To anticipate what is and what others will find funny, one must have subtle and tacit knowledge about other people's tastes. 

Thus, in Study 1 we presented participants with a series of jokes and asked them to rate the humor of each one. 

We then compared their ratings with those provided by a panel of experts, namely, professional comedians who make their living by recognizing what is funny and reporting it to their audiences. 

By comparing each participant's ratings with those of our expert panel, we could roughly assess participants' ability to spot humor.


Our key interest was how perceptions of that ability converged
with actual ability. Specifically, we wanted to discover whether
. those who did poorly on our measure would recognize the low
quality of their performance. Would they recognize it or would
they be unaware?

## Method

Participants. Participants were 65 Cornell University undergraduates
from a variety of courses in psychology who earned extra credit for their
participation.

Materials. We created a 30-item questionnaire made up of jokes we
felt were of varying comedic value. Jokes were taken from Woody Allen
(1975), Al Frankin (1992). and a book of "really silly" pet jokes by Jeff
Rovin (1996). 

To assess joke quality, we contacted several professional
comedians via electronic mail and asked them to rate each joke on a scale
ranging from 1 (not at all funny) to 11 (very funny). Eight comedians
responded to our request (Bob Crawford, Costaki Economopoulos, Paul
Frisbie, Kathleen Madigan, Ann Rose, Allan Sitterson, David Spark, and
Dan St. Paul). 

Although the ratings provided by the eight comedians were
moderately reliable (a = .72), an analysis of interrater correlations found
that one (and only one) comedian's ratings failed to correlate positively
with the others (mean r = - .09). 

We thus excluded this comedian's ratings
in our calculation of the humor value of each joke, yielding a final a of .76.
Expert ratings revealed that jokes ranged from the not so funny (e.g.,
"Question: What is big as a man, but weighs nothing? Answer: His
shadow." Mean expert rating = 1.3) to the very funny (e.g., "If a kid asks
where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is 'God is crying.'

And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is
'probably because of something you did."' Mean expert rating = 9.6).
Procedure. Participants rated each joke on the same 11-point scale
used by the comedians. Afterward, participants compared their "ability to
recognize what's funny" with that of the average Cornell student by
providing a percentile ranking. In this and in all subsequent studies, we
explained that percentile rankings could range from 0 (I'm at the very
bottom) to 50 (I'm exactly average) to 99 (I'm at the very top).

## Results and Discussion

Gender failed to qualify any results in this or any of the studies
reported in this article, and thus receives no further mention.

Our first prediction was that participants overall would overestimate their ability to tell what is funny relative to their peers. To
find out whether this was the case, we first assigned each participant a percentile rank based on the extent to which his or her joke
ratings correlated with the ratings provided by our panel of professionals (with higher correlations corresponding to better performance). On average, participants put their ability to recognize
what is funny in the 66th percentile, which exceeded the actual
mean percentile (50, by definition) by 16 percentile points, onesample t(64) = 7.02, p < .0001. This overestimation occurred
even though self-ratings of ability were significantly correlated
with our measure of actual ability, r(63) = .39, p < .001.

Our main focus, however, is on the perceptions of relatively
"incompetent" participants, which we defined as those whose test
score fell in the bottom quartile (n = 16). As Figure 1 depicts,
these participants grossly overestimated their ability relative to
their peers. Whereas their actual performance fell in the 12th
percentile, they put themselves in the 58th percentile. These estimates were not only higher than the ranking they actually
achieved, paired t(15) = 10.33, p < .0001, but were also marginally higher than a ranking of "average" (i.e., the 50th percentile),
one-sample t(l5) = 1.96, p < .07. That is, even participants in the
bottom quarter of the distribution tended to feel that they were
better than average.

As Figure 1 illustrates, participants in other quartiles did not
overestimate their ability to the same degree. Indeed, those in the

## Summary

In short, Study 1 revealed two effects of interest. First, although
perceptions of ability were modestly correlated with actual ability,
people tended to overestimate their ability relative to their peers.
Second, and most important, those who performed particularly
poorly relative to their··peers were utterly unaware of this fact.
Participants scoring in the bottom quartile on our humor test not
only overestimated their percentile ranking, but they overestimated
it by 46 percentile points. To be sure, they had an inkling that they
were not as talented in this domain as were participants in the top
quartile, as evidenced by the significant correlation between perceived and actual ability. However, that suspicion failed to anticipate the magnitude of their shortcomings.

At first blush, the reader may point to the regression effect as an
alternative interpretation of our results. After all, we examined the
perceptions of people who had scored extremely poorly on the
objective test we handed them, and found that their perceptions
were less extreme than their reality. Because perceptions of ability
are imperfectly correlated with actual ability, the regression effect
virtually guarantees this result. Moreover, because incompetent
participants scored close to the bottom of the distribution, it was
nearly impossible for them to underestimate their performance.
Despite the inevitability of the regression effect, we believe that
the overestimation we observed was more psychological than
artifactual. For one, if regression alone were to blame for our
results, then the magnitude of miscalibration among the bottom
quartile would be comparable with that of the top quartile. A
glance at Figure 1 quickly disabuses one of this notion. Still, we
believe this issue warrants empirical attention, which we devote in
