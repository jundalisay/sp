The objective of our research is to discuss open-mindedly the different interpre- tations of quantum physics concerning the so-called problem of the nonlocality in quantum theory. This nonlocality is mainly connected with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) situations and is different from nonlocality as it is understood in the quantum field theory of elementary particles, where it means the breakdown of commutativ- ity for local observables for spacelike intervals. Interactions of elementary particles are here supposed to be local and possible extensions to non local theories (e.g., for superstring theory, etc.) will not be discussed here. Also, with regard to quantum cosmology (and, in general, also in quantum field theory in curved spacetime) some new types of nonlocality (e.g., nonlocality in time for time machines) arise. These important and controversial issues are not discussed in this book.
