Volume 2 was finished in year 636 of the Hijra

Chapter 133: The beginning of Islam until 636

Al-Masʿūdī says: In this book are contained summaries of what this volume comprises, showing that we have mentioned in each chapter what pertains to it of the kinds of sciences, the transmission of traditions, and the history of past generations, arranged according to what has been transmitted concerning the succession of dynasties, in proportion to the extent of our presentation. We have given, in each chapter, details concerning kings, the length of their reigns, the number of their years, what was transmitted from them of poems and traditions, and, after that, the memorable events, the astonishing tales, the wonders of the ages, the reports about peoples and the differences in their customs, and what took place in the branches of knowledge in each age, with the names of the scholars and the circles in which they were seated, in whatever domain it might be.


It was narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas and others that the first thing that God Almighty created was water.
His throne was over the water, and when He wanted to create for others, He brought forth from the water smoke, which rose above the water and made the heavens. Then the water dried up, making it one, then He purified it, making it seven earths in two days, on Sunday and Monday.

And God created the Earth upon the rock. And the whale is what God mentioned in His Book in the Qur’an: {And by the pen and what they inscribe}. And the whale and the water upon the rock.
And the rock was upon the back of an angel, and the angel was upon a rock, and the rock was upon a man.
And the fish is what God Almighty mentioned in the Qur’an: the saying of Qanan to his son, “O my son, it is (even) the weight of a mustard seed, and it is in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the trees. God brings it forth. Indeed, God is Subtle and Acquainted.” So the whale trembled, and it was shaken. The earth is covered with a Persian mountain, and it has become firm. This is the saying of God Almighty: And He cast down.
