From them, the spear of the Arabs is marked.
- They have the eyes, and they have the palm trees, the grapes, the corn, the bananas, and the wheat.

Their land is part of the land of Yemen, and the wonders of al-Fayoum are as if they were in the land of Islam.

Their kings claim that:
- they are from the people of Jabr
- their kingdom is in the lands which the Egyptians call the Asuwaniyya.

From it are the stones of the mills, which the ancients transported after the coming of Christianity, and from them are the ships.

From them are the columns that are in Alexandria, and the great column in it. 

There is no column like it in the world.

I saw a column in the mountain of Aswan next to this column.

It was designed, but they did not separate it from the mountain and did not complete what appeared from it.

But they were waiting for it to be separated from the mountain. 

So they made it solid and then they made it roll to where they wanted in Fayoum.'

He was asked about the city on the bank of the Nile, and the one who is with him, he will be asked about Fayoum and the Nile, and the stone. 

He mentioned a long word about the matter of Fayoum and its canals from a source... and as for the matter of the Nile of Fayoum in the days of the Nile, there was no... and the stone, which is a place for the water.

Its outlet is a place for the water from the place that is known for its name on this day, and it is called al-Ma'moul.

He said that Joseph ibn Yaqub built it by the command of al-Aziz and it was managed by... and from it, Fayoum is the one that is today.

It is from the high and regular bay and from a large bay with its water. It is the famous bridge with its money... and the column that is in the middle of Fayoum, and it is the wonder of the world, and it is a high shape that no one can reach."

<!-- The people were divided, and a person would be asked after a time, but they would not have been able to... and  -->

The people dug a hole and poured water on it. The head of this column is... and as for the stone of the Nile, it is the stone in which there is between the Copts on the side of the Nile, and the stone in the village, which is in between them... on the surface of the Nile and the water runs over it before the Nile.

The number of the floods is... and the stone of the high ground, a place for a part of the water, and a person would come to them, but he would not see anything.

Between the 2 Copts... and between the low ground and the lower part of the Nile, the water enters and the channels are made to receive it, and the canals are made to take the water out of it, and they will know from it for a few days the rising and falling of the Nile and the height... from it to the channels of the stones, and the rising of the Nile... so the stone of the Nile."

The lands were assigned to their inhabitants, and were called by the names: Antoun, Qibt, Wasa, and Antarib. 

These names became attached to these regions, where lineages mixed greatly, and many tribes were born. 

Marriage ties were established, and they spread throughout the land.

Foreigners entered among them. The mixture increased until the Copts of Egypt were established.

Each of them was linked by lineage to his kin, and every generation after them followed the same custom until the time of Misr ibn Baisar ibn Ham ibn Noah. 

At that time, in this forest, the Copts of Egypt perished. 

Misr ibn Baisar became king, and Egypt was named after him. 

His reign lasted many years, after which came Atreib ibn Misr, who ruled for 30 years. 

After him came Harwab, who ruled for 30 years. 

After him came Malik ibn Malalis, who ruled for 40 years. 

After him came another Malik ibn Malalis, who ruled for 50 years. 

After him came Balatis, who ruled for 40 years. 

After him came Harwab ibn Malik, who ruled for 40 years. 

After him came Talatis, who ruled for 70 years.

Then came his daughter, who ruled after him for 20 years

then her son who succeeded her. 

Then, Misr ibn Ham became king and spread throughout Egypt, multiplying in number. 

They fought wars and overcame their enemies until they had dominion. 

But then they committed injustice and wronged themselves, so God afflicted them with rulers who overpowered them.

Then, after him came Malik ibn Douma, who fought many wars, until he died. 

Then Malik al-Walid ibn Douma ruled, until he too died. 

Then came Malik al-Rayyan ibn al-Walid, to whom, it is said, belonged the time of Josep who became minister under him. 

Some claim that Josephâ€™s story with him was exactly as told in the books. 

Others say it was in the time of another king called al-Aziz, but the stronger opinion is that al-Rayyan ibn al-Walid was the ruler of Egypt at that time.

His reign lasted many years. After him came his son, Malik Kabis ibn al-Rayyan.

Then after him his brother Malik Musab, then after him Malik Qurun, and after him Malik Muusa.

The Fayoum is watered with enough water that it enters the water and comes out. 

The wonders of the building and the perfection of the building and the building on what remains of the building.

It remains on the surface of the earth. It does not move or tremble with the engineering and the philosophy of the most beautiful and perfect construction. 

He mentioned a lot about the affairs of our countries that Joseph had governed. 

He was asked, 'When the Copts came to our land and took over it, what did they give of their news and their secrets, which were about the wonders of their building and their perfection?'

This man, from the land of Egypt, appeared from his religion to the Copts, and he saw a group of Christian Copts.

The Sultan Ahmad ibn Tulun sat with him on some days and he was present with some of the people of knowledge. He asked him about the sign of the religion of the Christian Copts and what he saw of that, so he said: 

'The Copts, the people of the book...' and he mentioned a great number of these signs..."

<!-- Page 387 (Right) -->

The Copt religion is a contradictory religion. Their existence is a contradictory existence. The minds and souls are contradictory to each other.

They do not look at them with the mind and the senses. There is no argument. The argument is weak from the mind and the senses with the mind. 

When looking at it, I saw many of them and great kings with knowledge and understanding, so I saw that their adherence and their religion, they do not accept them and do not accept them with what I mentioned. 

A lot of what they mentioned in the rational evidence is what their sciences and their actions are, and what they had in their actions, which is the religion, and what is in them of contradictions. 

He said: 'Is this possible?' 

The religion of the Copts is what they follow, and they do not believe it.

The three in one, and their description of the two gods and the third one is the spirits in their souls.
