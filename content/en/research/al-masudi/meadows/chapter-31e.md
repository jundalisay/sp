"A rare example, a scholar who has not met a human being, a modern one. And what happened in it is that a great and high building was erected, and it was placed on its head with a thorn like a camel's thorn. 

He hit its head with a stick and it became a rod. He said, 'What do you want?' 

I saw the man and asked him about that. And he did not move to touch it. 

He refused to be asked about it. So he called for water to wash his hands. 

He was held back from washing, so he did not wash his hands because of his rejection of their religion. 

The ruler of Egypt, on some days, sat down with some of the people of knowledge and asked them about the Coptic religion. 

He said: 

'The Copts, the people of the book,' and they mentioned a great deal of these signs. 

He was asked, 'What is the matter with this writing on the pyramids and the wilderness that cannot be read?' 

He said, 'Leave the words to the people of the time who could understand this.' 

Egypt passed down the pyramids. It was mastered by its people with a pure mouth and the forms of the written language and the Coptic language. 

So they read it according to their interpretations and mixed the alphabet of the Romans with the letters according to what they created from the writing between the Romans and the first Copts. So their writing was lost from them. 

He was asked, 'Who was the first to settle in Egypt?' 

He said, 'The first was Misr ibn Baris ibn Ham ibn Noah'.

He mentioned in the genealogies."

A brother would marry his brother's daughter and allow the Coptic priests to have intercourse with women.

They would marry their brother's daughter from his sons' sons. But they do not mention it from their secrets, and it is a disgusting thing, and they do not reveal it.

This is what the ruler of Egypt denied, and he found that no one knows it except one of them.

He found a Coptic doctor. The doctor met a man who was with his brother's daughter. 

Then he accepted her. 

He said to him, 'I am a foreigner'

He pointed to the Coptic religion. He said to him, 'Is there any man who does not have any relationship with you, but he will be questioned about the matter of the pyramids?' 

He said: 'Yes, I was told about the matter of the Copts. They are not a religious people. And how can they do that? I am a Jew, so he said, 'No, for they are Jews,' and he mentioned that."

"...the one who took the sons with the sins of the fathers. Then he mentioned that they were the daughters of Lot and what they did with him, and his son was born to him from them. 

He said, 'And he was a great scholar.' 

He returned the message twice until the anger of God Almighty intensified against him. 

Aaron made the golden calf and the children of Israel, and Moses showed them wonders to Pharaoh, so they did the same.

The sacrifices of the animals and their closeness to God in their blood and their meat. 

Their rule over the intellect and their prevention of looking at it without evidence. 

Their saying to their followers, 'Do not accept from them, and do not accept from one of the prophets after Moses, if something happened to them, they would be sad.

He was told about the story of the two eyes between Moses and others from the prophets. So the greater argument is then their saying. 

They mention a lot in the day of the servant of al-Qa'wa, and they will not believe that."

"...a man in this day, he is standing, and he is a great scholar. 

He shakes his head and says, 'And if I was in the house of a prophet or a ruler.' 

He said, 'He came to me with the books of the Jews and their sayings and their contradictions. 

He mentioned that the Copt would sit with many philosophers, Sabeans, and Magians. And he would mention some of them, and he would hold their stories in his book.

This is mentioned in the book Akhbar al-Zaman in the second volume. 

We have not come to this from a position of knowledge or from a saying that leads to the corruption of the sight and the intellect."

"...and the Persians. The man remained with Ibn Tulun for 6 years, presenting his news and giving him a rare example. 

He said something about the man's being a hermit in his country and staying after that for a period of time.

The era of the one who was destroyed, and what he said about his descriptions of his males and the Jews, and what the Copts mentioned about the marriage of the brother's daughter and most of them marry their sister's daughter. 

Al-Mas'udi said: 'And in the Nile and its land there are many wonderful kinds of land and sea animals, and from them are the known fish with a strange sight. 

When it falls into the net of the fisherman, its body is in its middle and its tails are... and it is thrown out on the shore or if it is on the beach, it is caught by it, and if it is not caught by it, it will not be eaten because of the harm it causes.'

...which is the one that has been in the Nile for an hour, it goes out of the water and ends and comes to some of the places of the land of the people of Egypt. 

The Nile continues to flow in its place without changing, and it does not decrease from it due to the length of the customs and the experiences.

Its appearance is from the water, which is the flood of the lands and the crops.

That is what appears from the water in the Nile. The water ends at the place of the crops.

Then it returns to the place it came from. And it is the place that has no end in its course, and it is a place for something that a person can see. 

If the amount of the flood is not enough for the crops, then the Nile will be low, and the water will be in its depths in various places.

The water will be in the middle of it. The person will see more of that, and he will not be harmed by its lack. He will show his face to it."

The places were lost to their inhabitants and became known by their names, such as Anton, Qaybat, Sa, and Atrib. 

These are the names of these places up to this point. Lineages became mixed and they multiplied, and Copts were born, dominating the rest of the land, and others were included in their lineages.

So every Copt remained in Egypt, and every group of them in Egypt, their lineage was linked.

They were connected to Egypt during their time, the son of Baysar, son of Ham, son of Noah. 

At this point, no Copt perished except in Egypt, a king called Misra, and after him, Atrib, and after him, his son, Horab, and after him, Malalib, and after him, his son, Malalib, and after him, Baltis, and after him, his son, Horab, and after him, Totis. She ruled for about seven hundred years. 

Then, after him, a woman called Masum ruled, and she gave birth to Mabim, and she ruled for many years after him.

Then, in Egypt, the son of Ham, son of Noah, was born. 

They spread out, multiplied, and ruled. Women multiplied, and the kings of the earth were nourished by them. 

A king from the Amalekites, named Al-Walid ibn Dumgh, marched against them from the Levant. 

They fought him, but he defeated them and ruled over them. He ruled until his death. After him, Rayyan ibn Al-Walid ruled, and his rule remained stable until his death. 

After him, Darim ibn Al-Rayyan ruled, then Rayyan ibn Al-Walid, who was the ruler of Joseph. 

It is said that the one who was with Joseph during his time was Al-Aziz, and God Almighty mentioned his experience with Joseph. It is also said that his wife, Al-Aziz's wife, tried to seduce him. 

The most well-known in the books is that Rayyan ruled Egypt at that time. 

Rayyan ruled for many years, then Qabis ibn Al-Rayyan ruled after him, then Mus'ab ibn Qabis ruled after him, then Qarqun ruled after him, then Musa ruled after him, then Senus ruled after him.

A fence of land and sea was built on it, and whoever lived near their quarters of kings and Al-Muradi Kharutub for Al-Khafi' from Al-Qasim and others was determined for that from different aspects other than what we have and with us, so I killed them for 3 years and a little less than that, and I took the Amir Al-Saran and the images and perfected the tools for that from different aspects other than what we sent and I killed them for three years and a little less than that.

I took the Amir Al-Balran and the images and perfected the tools of the sea and made it in the Balran a supporter of cold from every direction and their master was a camel or a rope and known in it from the cold in the sea from the ships from towards the Maghreb and the Levant and made in these great constructed Balran the secrets of nature and the edges of stones and snakes and animals from the Jamadibeh and the Dawatiyah and made that at times of intelligent movements and their connection to the higher powers so that when an army from towards the tyrant came to them"

The mixing of the children of Egypt with Egypt and he was Arab Ptolemy and we followed that in the middle book and Pharaoh perished.

They drowned when he went out in pursuit of the Children of Israel when Moses, son of Imran, brought them out, with God Almighty opening for them a way in the sea of Bybes. 

When Pharaoh and those who were with him from his soldiers were drowned, those who remained in the land of Egypt from the children, women and weak feared that the kings of the Levant and the Maghreb would attack them. So they said about them a woman of opinion and wisdom called Dhuluka. 

So she built a wall on the land of Masarra, and placed copper and guards and men on it. The trace of this wall remains, separating their voices, training some of them from others.

The trace of this wall remains until this time, and it is the year 332.

It is known as the Wall of Al-Kafish. He was very immoral, and as for his daughter Hawqa, he was very stubborn with her son.
