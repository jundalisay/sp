Ornamentation for p7 of Berkeley's 'The analyst'


<!-- SECT. 1. Mathematicians presumed to be the great Masters of Reason. Hence an undue deference to their decisions where they have no right to decide. This one Cause of Infidelity.

2. Their Principles and Methods to be examined with the same freedom, which they assume with regard to the Principles and Mysteries of Religion. In what Sense and how far Geometry is to be allowed an Improvement of the Mind.

3. Fluxions the great Object and Employment of the profound Geometricians in the present Age. What these Fluxions are.

4. Moments or nascent Increments of flowing Quantities difficult to conceive. Fluxions of different Orders. Second and third Fluxions obscure Mysteries.

5. Differences, i. e. Increments or Decrements infinitely small, used by foreign Mathematicians instead of Fluxions or Velocities of nascent and evanescent Increments.

6. Differences of various Orders, i. e. Quantities infinitely less than Quntities infinitely little; and infinitesimal Parts, of infinitesimals of infinitesimals, &. without end or limit.

7. Mysteries in faith unjustly objected against by those who admit them in Science.

8. Modern Analysts supposed by themselves to extend their views even beyond infinity: Deluded by their own Species or Symbols.

9. Method for finding the Fluxion of a Rectangle of two indeterminate Quantities, shewed to be illegitimate and false.

10. Implicit Deference of Mathematicalmen for the great Author of Fluxions. Their earnestiness rather to go on fast and far, than to set out warily and see their way distinctly.

11. Momentums difficult to comprehend. No middle Quantity to be admitted between a finite Quantity and nothing, without admitting Infinitesimals.

12. The Fluxion of any Power of a flowing Quantity. Lemma premised in order to examine the method for finding such Fluxion.

13. The rule for the Fluxions of Powers attained by unfair reasoning.

14. The aforesaid reasoning farther unfolded and shew'd to be illogical.

15. No true Conclusion to be justly drawn by direct consequence from inconsistent Suppositions. The same Rules of right reason to be observed, whether Men argue in Symbols or in Words.

16. An Hypothesis being destroyed, no consequence of such Hypothesis to be retained.

17. Hard to distinguish between evanescent Increments and infinitesimal Differences. Fluxions placed in various Lights. The great Author, it seems, not satisfied with his own Notions.

18. Quantities infinitely small supposed and rejected by Leibnitz and his Followers. No Quantity, according to them, greater or smaller for the Addition or Subduction of its Infinitesimal.

19. Conclusions to be porved by the Principles, and not Principles by the Conclusions.

20. The Geometrical Analyst considered as a Logician; and his Discoveries, not in themselves, but as derived from such Principles and such Inferences.

21. A Tangent drawn to the Parabola according to the calculus differentialis. Truth shewn to be the result of error, and how.

22. By virtue of a twofold mistake Analysts arrive at Truth, but not at Science: ignorant how they come at their own Conclusions.

23. The Conclusion never evident or accurate, in virtue of obscure or inaccurate Premises. Finite Quantities might be rejected as well as Infinitesimals.

24. The foregoing Doctrine farther illustrated.

25. Sundry Observations thereupon.

26. Ordinate found from the Area by means of evanescent Increments.

27. In the foregoing Case the supposed evanescent Increment is really a finite Quantity, destroyed by an equal Quantity with an opposite Sign.

28. The foregoing Case put generally. Algebraical Expressions compared with Geometrical Quantities.

29. Correspondent Quanities Algebraical and Geomtrical equated. The Analysis shewed not to obtain in Infintesimals, but it must also obtain in finite Quantities.

30. The getting rid of Quantities by the received Principles, whether of Fluxions or of Differences, neither good Geometry nor good Logic. Fluxions or Velocities, why introduced.

31. Velocities not to be abstracted from Time and Space: Nor their Proportions to be investigated or considered exclusively of Time and Space.

32. Difficult and obscure Points constitute the Principles of the modern Analysi, and are the Foundation on which it is built.

33. The rational Faculties whether improved by such obscure Analytics.

34. By what inconceivable Steps finite Lines are found proportional to Fluxions. Mathematical Infidels strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel.

35. Fluxions or Infinitesimals not to be avoided on the received Principles. Nice Abstractions and Geometrical Metaphysics.

36. Velocities of nascent or evanescent Quantities, whether in reality understood and signified by finite Lines and Species.

37. Signs or Exponents obvious; but Fluxions themselves not so.

38. Fluxions, whether the Velocities with which infinitesimal Differences are generated?

39. Fluxions of Fluxions or second Fluxions, whether to be conceived as Velocities of Velocities, or rather as Velocities of the second nascent Increments?

40. Fluxions considered, sometimes in one Sense, sometimes in another: One while in themselves, another in their Exponents: Hence Confusion and Obscurity.

41. Isochronal Increments, whether finite or nascent, proportional to their respective Velocities.

42. Time supposed to be divided into Moments: Increments generated in those Moments: And Velocities proportional to those Increments.

43. Fluxions, second, third, fourth, &c. what they are; how obtained, and how represented. What Idea of Velocity in a Moment of Time and Point of Space.

44. Fluxions of all Orders inconceivable.

45. Signs or Exponents confounded with the Fluxions.

46. Series of Expressions or of Notes easily contrived. Whether a Series, of mere Velocities, or of mere nascent Increments, cerresponding thereunto, be as easily conceived?

47. Celerities dismissed, and instead thereof Ordinates and Areas introduced. Analogies and Expressions useful in the modern Quadratures, may yet be useless for enabling us to conceive Fluxions. No right to apply the Rules without knowledge of the Principles.

48. Metaphysics of modern Analysts most incomprehensible.

49. Analysis employ'd about notional shadowy Entities. Their Logics as exceptionable as their Metaphysics.

50. Occasion of this Address. Conclusion. Queries.

1. I am a Stranger to your Person, yet I am not, Sir, a Stranger to the Reputation you have acquired, in that branch of Learning which hath been your peculiar Study; nor to the Authority that you therefore assume in things foreign to your Profession, nor to the Abuse that you, and too many more of the like Charader, are known to make of such undue Authority, to the misleading of unwary Persons in matters of the highest Concernment, and whereof your mathematical Knowledge can by no means qualify you to be a competent Judge. 

Equity indeed and good Sense would incline one to disregard the Judgment of Men, in Points which they have not considered or examined. But several who make the loudest Claim to those Qualities, do, nevertheless, the very thing they would seem to despise, clothing themselves in the Livery of other Mens opinions, and putting on a general deference for the Judgment of you, Gentlement, who are presumed to be of all Men the greatest Masters of Reson, to be most conversant about distinct Ideas, and never to take things upon trust, but always clearly to see your way, as Men whose constant Employment is the deducing Truth by the justest inference from the most evident Principles. With this bias on their Minds, they submit to your Decisions where you have no right to decide. And that this is one short way of making Infidels I am credibly informed.

2. Whereas then it is supposed, that you apprehend more distinctly, consider more closely, infer more justly, conclude more accurately than other men, and that you are therefore less religious because more judicious, I shall claim the privilege of a Free-Thinker; and take the Liberty to inquire into the Object, Principles, and Method of Demonstration admitted by the Mathematicians of the present Age, with the same freedom that you presume to treat the Principles and Mysteries of Religion; to the end, that all Men may see what right you have to lead, or what Encouragement others have to follow you. It hath been an older remark that Geometry is an excellent Logic. 

When the Definitions are clear; when the Postulata cannot be refused, nor the Axioms denied; when from the distinct Contemplation and Comparison of Figures, their Properties are derived, by a perpetual well-connected chain of Consequences, the Objects being still kept in view, and the attention ever fixed upon them; there is acquired an habit of reasoning, close and exact and methodical: which habit strengthens and sharpens the Mind, and being transferred to other Subjects, is of general use in the inquiry after Truth. But how far this is the case of our Geometrical Analysts, it may be worth while to consider.


3. The Method of Fluxions is the general Key, by help whereof the modern Mathematicians unlock the secrets of Geometry, and consequently of Nature.

And as it is that which hath enabled them so remarkably to outgo the Ancients in discovering Theorems and solving Problems, the exercise and application thereof is become the main, if not sole, employment of all those who in this Age pass for profound Geometers. 

But whether this Method be clear or obscure, consistent or repugnant, demonstrative or precarious, as I shall inquire with the utmost impartiality, so I submit my inquiry to your own Judgment, and that of every candid Reader. Lines are supposed to be generated[1] by the motion of Points, Plains by the motion of Lines, and Solids by the motion of Plains.

And whereas Quantities generated in equal times are greater or lesser, according to the greater or lesser Velocity, wherewith they increase and are generated, a Method hath been found to determine Quantities from the Velocities of their generating Motions. 

And such Velocities are called Fluxions: and the Quantities generated are called flowing Quantities. These Fluxions are said to be nearly as the Increments of the flowing Quantities, generated in the least equal Particles of time; and to be accurately in the first Proportion of the nascent, or in the last of the evanescent, Increments.

Sometimes, instead of Velocities, the momentaneous Increments or Decrements of undetermined flowing Quantities are considered, under the Appellation of Moments.


4. By Moments we are not to understand finite Particles. 


Finite Particles are Quantities generated from Moments, which last are only the nascent Principles of finite Quantities. 

It is said, that the minutest Errors are not to be neglected in Mathematics: that the Fluxions are Celerities, not proportional to the finite Increments though ever so small; but only to the Moments or nascent Increments, whereof the Proportion alone, and not the Magnitude, is considered. 

And of the aforesaid Fluxions there be other Fluxions, which Fluxions of Fluxions are called second Fluxions. 

The Fluxions of these second Fluxions are called third Fluxions: and soon, fourth, fifth, sixth, &c. ad infinitum. 

Our Sense is strained and puzzled with the perception of Objects extremely minute, even so the Imagination, which Faculty derives from Sense, is very much strained and puzzled to frame clear Ideas of the least Particles of time, or the least Increments generated therein: and much more so to comprehend the Moments, or those Increments of the flowing Quantities in statu nascenti, in their very first origin or beginning to exist, before they become finite Particles.

It is still more difficult, to conceive the abstracted Velocities of such nascent imperfect Entities. 

But the Velocities of the Velocities, the second, third, fourth and fifth Velocities, &c. exceed, if I mistake not, all Humane Underftanding. 

The further the Mind analyseth and pursueth these fugitive Ideas, the more it is lost and bewildered; the Objects, at first fleeting and minute, soon vanishing out of sight. 

Certainly in any Sense a second or third Fluxion seems an obscure Mystery. 

The incipient Celerity of an incipient Celerity, the nascent Augment of a nascent Augment, i. e. of a thing which hath no Magnitude: Take it in which light you please, the clear Conception of it will, if I mistake not, be found impossible, whether it be so or no I appeal to the trial of every thinking Reader. And if a second Fluxion be inconceivable, what are we to think of third, fourth, fifth Fluxions, and so onward without end?


5. The foreign Mathematicians are said to proceed in a way less accurate and geometrical, yet more intelligible. 

Instead of flowing Quantities and their Fluxions, they consider the variable finite Quantities, as increasing or diminishing by the continual Addition or Subduction of infinitely small Quantities.

Instead of the Velocities wherewith Increments are generated, they consider the Increments or Decrements themselves, which they call Differences, and which are supposed to be infinitely small.

The Difference of a Line is an infinitely little Line; of a Plain an infinitely little Plain. 

They suppose finite Quantities to consist of Parts infinitely little, and Curves to be Polygones, whereof the Sides are infinitely little, which by the Angles they make one with another determine the Curvity of the Line.

To conceive a Quantity infinitely small, that is, infinitely less than any sensible or imaginable Quantity, or than any the least finite Magnitude, is, I confess, above my Capacity.

But to conceive a Part of such infinitely small Quantity, that shall be still infinitely less than it, and consequently though multiply'd infinitely shall never equal the minutest finite Quantity, is, I suspect, an infinite Difficulty to any Man whatsoever; and will be allowed such by those who candidly say what they think; provided they really think and reflect, and do not take things upon trust.


6. Yet in the calculus differentialis, which Method serves to all the same Intents and Ends with that of Fluxions, our modern Analysts are not content to consider only the Differences of finite Quantities: they also consider the Differences of those Differences, and the Differences of the Differences of the first Differences. And so on ad infinitum.

They consider Quantities infinitely less than the least discernible Quantity; and others infinitely less than those infinitely small ones; and still others infinitely less than the preceding Infinitesimals, and so on without end pr limit. 

Insomuch that we are to admit an infinite succession of Infinitesimals, each infinitely less than the foregoing, and infinitely greater than the following.

As there are first, second, third, fourth, fifth, &c. Fluxions, so there are Differences, first, second, third, fourth, &c. in an infinite Progression towards nothing, which you still approach and never arrive at.

And (which is most strange) although you should take a Million of Millions of these Infinitesimals, each whereof is supposed infinitely greater than some other real Magnitude, and add them to the least given Quantity, it shall be never the bigger. For this is one of the modest postulata of our modern Mathematicians, and is a Corner-stone or Ground-work of their Speculations.
