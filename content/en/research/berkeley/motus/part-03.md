16 The doctrine of motion has been remarkably confused by metaphysical abstractions is even clearer when we examine the varying views of prominent thinkers regarding force and impulse. Leibniz confuses impulse with motion. According to Newton, impulse is actually the same as inertial force. 

Borelli asserts that impulse is nothing other than a degree of velocity. Some distinguish impulse from effort (conatus), others do not. 

Most take motive force to be proportional to motion. Yet some think there is another kind of force besides the motive one, measured differently—such as by the square of the velocity multiplied by the mass. But it would be endless to go into all this.


17 Terms like *force*, *gravity*, *attraction*, and the like are useful for reasoning and calculating about motion and moving bodies—but not for understanding the simple nature of motion itself, or for indicating so many distinct qualities. 

As for attraction, it is clear that Newton employed it not as a real, physical quality, but merely as a mathematical hypothesis. Even Leibniz, distinguishing elementary effort or solicitation from impulse, admits these entities do not exist in reality, but must be formed by abstraction.


18 The same applies to the composition and resolution of any direct forces into oblique ones using the diagonal and sides of a parallelogram. These serve mechanics and calculation, but serving mathematical demonstration is different from describing the nature of things.


19 Many moderns believe that motion is neither destroyed nor created anew, but that the same total quantity of motion always remains. Aristotle too once raised the question—whether motion is generated and destroyed, or eternal (*Physics*, Book VIII).

That sensible motion perishes is evident to the senses; yet they seem to want to assert that the same impulse, effort, or total force remains. Hence Borelli affirms that the force in impact is not diminished, but expanded; that even contrary impulses can be received and retained in the same body. 

Likewise, Leibniz claims that effort exists everywhere and always in matter, and is known by reason where it is not seen by the senses. But such views are too abstract and obscure—essentially of the same kind as *substantial forms* and *entelechies*.


20 All who attempt to explain the cause and origin of motion by a *hylarchic principle*, or by *nature's deficiency*, *appetite*, or even *natural instinct*, are to be considered as speaking rather than thinking. 

Nor are those much better who suppose that parts of the earth move themselves, or even that spirits are implanted in them like forms, to account for the acceleration of falling bodies; or who claim that, besides solid extension, something else must be posited in a body to explain its force.

For such people either declare nothing particular or definite—or, if they do, it will be as hard to explain as the very thing it was meant to explain.



21 Things that cannot be perceived by the senses or understood by reason are of no use in clarifying the nature of things. 

We must look to what sense, experience, and reason based on these can tell us. 

There are 2 chief kinds of things:

1. Body 
2. Mind

We know:
- the extended, solid, mobile, shaped, and sensible body through the senses
- the feeling, perceiving, understanding, and conscious mind by internal awareness.

These things are plainly different and fundamentally heterogeneous. I speak, of course, of known things—for to discuss unknowns is useless.



22 Everything we know and call "body" contains nothing within it that could be the principle or efficient cause of motion.

Impenetrability, extension, and shape neither include nor imply any power to produce motion; indeed, quite the opposite. 

If we examine not only these but all other qualities of body in detail, we’ll see they are all truly passive and contain nothing active that could be understood as a source or principle of motion.

As for gravity, we’ve already shown that the term designates nothing known that differs from the visible effect whose cause we seek.

When we call a body “heavy,” we mean only that it moves downward, without thinking at all about the cause of this observable effect.


23 So we may boldly declare—since it is a known matter—that body is not the principle of motion. 

If anyone insists that by the word "body" he includes, beyond solid extension and its modifications, some occult quality, power, form, or essence, then he may dispute without ideas and misuse names that express nothing distinctly. 

A sounder method of philosophizing seems to avoid, as much as possible, abstract and general notions—if they can even be called notions when they cannot be understood.


24 We know everything contained in the idea of body. 

What we do know of body is not the principle of motion. Those who imagine something unknown in the body, of which they have no idea, and call it the principle of motion, are really only saying that the principle of motion is unknown. But it's tedious to linger too long on such subtleties.
