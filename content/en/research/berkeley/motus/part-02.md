**8.** We generally think that *corporeal force* is something easily understood. Yet those who have examined the matter more carefully are of a different opinion, as is clear from the remarkable obscurity of the words they use when attempting to explain it. Torricelli says that force and impulse are certain abstract, subtle things—quintessences—contained within corporeal substance like in Circe’s magic vessel. Likewise, Leibniz, in explaining natural force, states: “Active, primitive force, which is *entelechia prima*, corresponds to the soul or substantial form.” See *Acta Eruditorum*, Leipzig. So necessary is it that even the greatest thinkers, so long as they indulge in abstractions, pursue terms with no definite meaning—mere scholastic shadows. Many other examples could be drawn from modern authors, enough to show that metaphysical abstractions have not entirely given way to mechanics and experiment, and that they still burden philosophers with a vain task.

**9.** From that source arise various absurdities—such as the idea that the force of impact, however slight, is infinitely great. This notion assumes that gravity is some real quality distinct from all others, and that gravitation is the operation of this quality, really distinct from motion. Yet the slightest impact produces a greater effect than the greatest gravity without motion—for impact generates motion, while gravity alone does not. Hence it follows that the force of impact exceeds the force of gravitation by an infinite ratio—that is, is infinitely great. See Galileo’s experiments and the writings of Torricelli, Borelli, and others on the defined force of impact.

**10.** Nevertheless, it must be admitted that no force is immediately perceived by itself, but only known and measured by its effects. But the *dead force*, or simple gravitation in a body at rest, produces no observable change and hence no effect; whereas impact does. Therefore, since forces are proportional to their effects, we may conclude that dead force is null. Yet it does not follow that the force of impact is infinite—just because it exceeds a null quantity by an infinite ratio doesn’t mean it is infinite in itself.

**11.** The force of gravity cannot be separated from *momentum*; but momentum without velocity is nothing, since it is mass multiplied by velocity; and velocity cannot be conceived without motion—thus, neither can gravitational force. Moreover, force is known and measured only through action, and we cannot consider the action of a body apart from its motion. Therefore, as long as a heavy body distorts the form of the lead beneath it or the cord suspending it, it is moving; when it is at rest, it acts not at all, or in other words, is prevented from acting. In short, the terms “dead force” and “gravitation,” although assumed by metaphysical abstraction to signify something distinct from the mover, the moved, the motion, and the rest, are in reality nothing at all.

**12.** If someone were to say that a hanging or resting weight acts upon the cord because it prevents the cord from springing back with its elastic force, I would reply that, by the same reasoning, any lower body acts upon an upper one resting on it because it prevents it from descending. But we cannot say that the action of a body is to prevent another from occupying the space it already occupies.

**13.** Sometimes we feel the pressure of a heavy body. But this unpleasant sensation arises from the motion of the heavy object transmitted to our body’s nerves and fibers, changing their position; thus, it should be attributed to impact. In these matters, we suffer from many deep-rooted prejudices—but they must be overcome, or rather entirely driven out, by sharp and repeated reflection.

**14.** In order to prove that any quantity is infinite, it must be shown that a finite, homogeneous part is contained in it infinitely many times. But dead force is related to impact force not as a part to a whole, but as a point to a line, according to the very authors who assert the infinitude of impact force. Much more could be added here, but I fear becoming too long-winded.

**15.** From the foregoing principles, notable disputes can be resolved which have greatly occupied learned minds. A case in point is the controversy over the proportion of forces. One party concedes that momentum, motion, and impulse, for a given mass, are simply proportional to velocity, yet affirms that forces are proportional to the square of the velocity. But this view assumes that a body’s force is distinct from its momentum, motion, and impulse—and once that assumption is removed, the opinion falls.

**16.** That the doctrine of motion has been remarkably confused by metaphysical abstractions is even clearer when we examine the varying views of prominent thinkers regarding force and impulse. Leibniz confuses impulse with motion. According to Newton, impulse is actually the same as inertial force. Borelli asserts that impulse is nothing other than a degree of velocity. Some distinguish impulse from effort (conatus), others do not. Most take motive force to be proportional to motion. Yet some think there is another kind of force besides the motive one, measured differently—such as by the square of the velocity multiplied by the mass. But it would be endless to go into all this.

**17.** Terms like *force*, *gravity*, *attraction*, and the like are useful for reasoning and calculating about motion and moving bodies—but not for understanding the simple nature of motion itself, or for indicating so many distinct qualities. As for attraction, it is clear that Newton employed it not as a real, physical quality, but merely as a mathematical hypothesis. Even Leibniz, distinguishing elementary effort or solicitation from impulse, admits these entities do not exist in reality, but must be formed by abstraction.

**18.** The same applies to the composition and resolution of any direct forces into oblique ones using the diagonal and sides of a parallelogram. These serve mechanics and calculation, but serving mathematical demonstration is different from describing the nature of things.

**19.** Many moderns believe that motion is neither destroyed nor created anew, but that the same total quantity of motion always remains. Aristotle too once raised the question—whether motion is generated and destroyed, or eternal (*Physics*, Book VIII). That sensible motion perishes is evident to the senses; yet they seem to want to assert that the same impulse, effort, or total force remains. Hence Borelli affirms that the force in impact is not diminished, but expanded; that even contrary impulses can be received and retained in the same body. Likewise, Leibniz claims that effort exists everywhere and always in matter, and is known by reason where it is not seen by the senses. But such views are too abstract and obscure—essentially of the same kind as *substantial forms* and *entelechies*.

**20.** All who attempt to explain the cause and origin of motion by a *hylarchic principle*, or by *nature's deficiency*, *appetite*, or even *natural instinct*, are to be considered as speaking rather than thinking. Nor are those much better who suppose that parts of the earth move themselves, or even that spirits are implanted in them like forms, to account for the acceleration of falling bodies; or who claim that, besides solid extension, something else must be posited in a body to explain its force. For such people either declare nothing particular or definite—or, if they do, it will be as hard to explain as the very thing it was meant to explain.

**21.** Things that cannot be perceived by the senses or understood by reason are of no use in clarifying the nature of things. We must look to what sense, experience, and reason based on these can tell us. There are two chief kinds of things—*body* and *mind*. We know the extended, solid, mobile, shaped, and otherwise sensible body through the senses; and the feeling, perceiving, understanding, and conscious mind by internal awareness. These things are plainly different and fundamentally heterogeneous. I speak, of course, of known things—for to discuss unknowns is useless.




Here is the English translation of the passage you provided (sections 22–30), taken from Latin:

---

**22.** Everything we know and call "body" contains nothing within it that could be the principle or efficient cause of motion. Impenetrability, extension, and shape neither include nor imply any power to produce motion; indeed, quite the opposite. If we examine not only these but all other qualities of body in detail, we’ll see they are all truly passive and contain nothing active that could be understood as a source or principle of motion. As for gravity, we’ve already shown that the term designates nothing known that differs from the visible effect whose cause we seek. Indeed, when we call a body “heavy,” we mean only that it moves downward, without thinking at all about the cause of this observable effect.

**23.** So we may boldly declare—since it is a known matter—that body is not the principle of motion. If anyone insists that by the word "body" he includes, beyond solid extension and its modifications, some occult quality, power, form, or essence, then he may dispute without ideas and misuse names that express nothing distinctly. A sounder method of philosophizing seems to avoid, as much as possible, abstract and general notions—if they can even be called notions when they cannot be understood.

**24.** We know everything contained in the idea of body. What we do know of body is not the principle of motion. Those who imagine something unknown in the body, of which they have no idea, and call it the principle of motion, are really only saying that the principle of motion is unknown. But it's tedious to linger too long on such subtleties.

**25.** Beyond corporeal things, there is another category: thinking beings. From our own experience, we know that these possess the power to move bodies; for our soul can, at will, initiate and stop the movement of limbs—however it may do so. This much is certain: bodies move at the command of the soul, and therefore the soul can rightly be called a principle of motion—though a particular and subordinate one, itself dependent on a primary and universal Principle.

**26.** Heavy bodies fall downward even when no apparent impulse sets them in motion. However, one must not conclude from this that the principle of motion lies within them. Aristotle explains: heavy and light things do not move themselves—for that would imply life, and the power to stop. All heavy objects follow the same fixed law toward the center of the Earth, and they display no principle or faculty by which they might stop, slow down, increase (except proportionally), or change this motion. Thus, they are entirely passive. The same, strictly speaking, must be said of bodies that cause impact. Whether moving or in the moment of impact, these bodies are just as passive as when they are at rest. An inert, resting body acts no more than a moving one, as Newton acknowledges when he states that inertia is the same as momentum. But an inert and resting body does nothing—therefore neither does the moving one.

**27.** In truth, a body persists equally in either state—motion or rest. But this persistence is no more an action of the body than its mere existence could be called an action. Persistence is just a continuation of the same mode of existence and cannot properly be called action. The resistance we feel when stopping a moving body is mistakenly attributed to the body’s action. In fact, that resistance is a sensation within us—it is we who suffer, not the body that acts. Clearly, we would experience the same thing whether the body moved itself or was moved by some external principle.

**28.** We speak of action and reaction in bodies, and this is convenient for mechanical demonstrations. But we must be careful not to suppose from this that there is any real force in them that serves as a cause or principle of motion. These terms should be understood in the same way as "attraction"—which Newton used not as a real physical quality, but merely as a mathematical hypothesis. In the same way, the laws of motion and the theorems derived from them remain valid in mechanical philosophy, whether we suppose the effects are caused by the action of bodies attracting one another or by the action of some separate agent moving and governing the bodies. Similarly, all rules and laws of motion, and the theorems based on them, hold firm as long as the observable effects are accepted and the reasoning is based on them—regardless of whether the cause of these effects lies in the body or in some incorporeal agent.

**29.** Take away from the idea of body its extension, solidity, and shape—and nothing remains. But these qualities are indifferent to motion and contain nothing that could be called a principle of motion. This is clear from our very ideas. So, if by “body” we mean what we conceive, it is plain that no principle of motion can be found in it: no part or attribute of it is a true efficient cause that produces motion. To speak a word without conceiving an idea is unworthy of a philosopher.

**30.** There exists a thinking, active thing, which we experience in ourselves as the principle of motion—this is what we call the soul, mind, or spirit. There also exists an extended, inert, impenetrable thing, which is fundamentally different—a whole other kind of being. The difference between thinking and extended things was first recognized by the very wise Anaxagoras, who declared that the mind has nothing in common with bodies, as Aristotle notes in the first book of *De Anima*. Among moderns, Descartes also perceived this distinction clearly. Others, however, have made what was already a clear idea obscure and difficult by wrapping it in confusing words.





Here is the English translation of the provided Latin text:

31. From what has been said, it is evident that those who affirm that active force, action, the principle of motion, truly exists in bodies, embrace an opinion founded on no experience, and establish it with obscure and general terms, nor do they sufficiently understand what they want. On the contrary, those who wish the mind to be the principle of motion put forth an opinion fortified by their own experience, and approved by the votes of all the most learned men of every age.

32. First, Anaxagoras introduced νοῦς [nous, mind], which would impress motion on inert matter. Aristotle also approves of this opinion, and confirms it with many arguments, openly declaring that the first mover is immobile, indivisible, and has no magnitude. But to say that every moving thing is movable, the same author rightly observed, is the same as saying that every building thing is buildable, *Physics*, Book III. Moreover, Plato in the *Timaeus* relates that this bodily machine, or visible world, is agitated and animated by mind, which escapes all sense. Furthermore, even today, the most learned philosophers acknowledge God as the principle of natural motions. And Newton everywhere and not obscurely suggests that not only did motion proceed from the divine power in the beginning, but that the world system is still moved by the same act. This is consistent with the sacred writings; this is confirmed by the calculation of the Scholastics. For even if the Peripatetics teach that nature is the principle of motion and rest, they nevertheless interpret the naturing nature to be God. They understand, of course, that all the bodies of this world system are moved by a most powerful mind according to a certain and constant reason.

33. Moreover, those who attribute a vital principle to bodies imagine something obscure and little in accord with things. For what else is it to be endowed with a vital principle than to live? Or what is it to live other than to move oneself, to stop, and to change one's state? But the most learned philosophers of this age posit as an indubitable principle that every body perseveres in its state, either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, unless it is compelled by some external force to change that state; on the contrary, in the soul we feel there is a faculty of changing both its own state and that of other things; this is properly called vital, and distinguishes the soul far from bodies.

34. The more recent thinkers consider motion and rest in bodies as two states of existence, in either of which every body would remain inert by its own nature, unless some external force urged it. From this it can be gathered that the cause of motion and rest is the same as the cause of the existence of bodies. Nor indeed does there seem to be another cause to be sought for the successive existence of a body in different parts of space than that from which the successive existence of the same body in different parts of time is derived. But to treat of God, the Best and Greatest, the Creator and Preserver of all things, and to demonstrate in what manner all things depend on the supreme and true Being, although it is a most excellent part of human knowledge, nevertheless pertains rather to first philosophy, or metaphysics and theology, than to natural philosophy, which today is almost entirely contained in experiments and mechanics. And so, natural philosophy either presupposes the knowledge of God, or borrows it from some higher science. Although it is most true that the investigation of nature everywhere supplies excellent arguments to the higher sciences for illustrating and proving the wisdom, goodness, and power of God.

35. The reason why these things are less understood is that some unjustly reject the mathematical principles of physics, namely on the grounds that they do not assign the efficient causes of things; when nevertheless it truly pertains to physics or mechanics to hand down only rules, not efficient causes, of impulses or attractions, and to say it in a word, the laws of motions; and from these laid down, to assign the solution, not the efficient cause, of particular phenomena.

[pg 514]
36. It will be very important to have considered what a principle properly is, and in what sense that word is to be understood among philosophers. Indeed, the true efficient and preserving cause of all things is most rightly called their source and principle. But the principles of experimental philosophy, properly so called, are the foundations on which it rests, or the sources from which the knowledge of corporeal things is derived (I do not say existence, but knowledge), namely the senses from experience. Similarly, in mechanical philosophy, the principles are said to be those in which the entire discipline is founded and contained, those primary laws of motion which, proven by experiments, have also been refined by reasoning and rendered universal. These laws of motion are conveniently called principles, because from them both general mechanical theorems and particular explanations of phenomena are derived.

37. Then indeed can something be said to be explained mechanically, when it is reduced to these simplest and most universal principles, and is shown through accurate reasoning to be consistent and connected with them. For once the laws of nature have been discovered, it must next be shown by the philosopher that from the constant observation of these laws, that is, from these principles, any phenomenon necessarily follows: this is to explain and solve phenomena, and to assign the cause, that is, the reason why they occur.

38. The human mind rejoices to extend and expand its knowledge. But for this, general notions and propositions must be formed, in which particular propositions and cognitions are in a certain way contained, which are then believed to be understood only when they are deduced from the former by a continuous connection. This is very well known to geometers. In mechanics also, notions, that is definitions, and primary and general statements about motion are put forward, from which [pg 515] afterwards more remote and less general conclusions are gathered by the mathematical method. And just as by the application of geometrical theorems, the magnitudes of particular bodies are measured; so also by the application of universal mechanical theorems, the motions of any parts of the world system, and the phenomena depending on them, become known and are determined: and it is to this goal that the physicist should uniquely aim.

39. And just as geometers, for the sake of their discipline, devise many things which they themselves can neither describe nor find in the nature of things; in exactly the same way the mechanician uses certain abstract and general terms, and imagines in bodies force, action, attraction, solicitation, &c., which are most useful for theories and statements, as well as calculations about motion, even if they would be sought in vain in the very truth of things and actually existing bodies, no less than those things which are imagined by geometers through mathematical abstraction.

40. In truth, by the aid of the senses we perceive nothing but effects or sensible qualities, and corporeal things entirely passive, whether they are in motion or at rest; and reason and experience suggest that nothing active exists besides mind or soul. Whatever else is imagined must be considered to be of the same kind as other hypotheses and mathematical abstractions: this must be deeply impressed upon the mind. If this is not done, we can easily relapse into the obscure subtlety of the Scholastics, which for so many centuries, like a dreadful plague, has corrupted philosophy.

41. The mechanical principles and the universal laws of motions or nature, happily discovered in the last century, and treated and applied with the aid of geometry, have brought wonderful light into philosophy. But metaphysical principles and the real efficient causes of motion and the existence of bodies or corporeal attributes in no way pertain to mechanics or experiments; nor can they shed light on them, except insofar as, being known beforehand, they serve to predefine the limits of physics, and in that way to remove difficulties and extraneous questions.

42. Those who seek the principle of motion from spirits understand by the word "spirit" either a corporeal or an incorporeal thing. If a corporeal thing, however subtle, the difficulty still returns; if incorporeal, however true that may be, nevertheless it does not properly pertain to [pg 516] physics. But if anyone extends natural philosophy beyond the limits of experiments and mechanics, so that it also comprehends the knowledge of incorporeal and unextended things, this broader acceptance of the word admits the treatment of the soul, mind, or vital principle. But it will be more convenient, according to the use now almost received, to so distinguish between the sciences that each is circumscribed by its own boundaries, and that the natural philosopher is entirely concerned with experiments, the laws of motion, and mechanical principles, and the reasonings drawn from them; but whatever he puts forth about other things, let him attribute it to some higher science. For indeed, from the known laws of nature, the most beautiful theories and even mechanical practices useful for life follow. But from the knowledge of the Author of nature himself, considerations arise that are indeed far more excellent, but are metaphysical, theological, and moral.
