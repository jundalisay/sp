1. Anyone who surveys the Objects of Humane Knowledge will see that they are either Ideas actually imprinted on the Senses, or else such as are perceived by attending to the Passions and Operations of the Mind, or lastly Ideas formed by help of Memory and Imagination, either compounding, dividing, or barely representing those originally perceived in the aforesaid ways. 

By Sight I have the Ideas of Light and Colours with their several Degrees and Variations. By Touch I perceive, for Example, Hard and Soft, Heat and Cold, Motion and Resistance, and of all these more and less either as to Quantity
or Degree. Smelling furnishes me with Odors; the Palate with Tastes, and Hearing conveys
Sounds to the Mind in all their variety of Tone and Composition. And as several of these
are observed to accompany each other, they come to be marked by one Name, and so to
be reputed as one Thing. Thus, for Example, a certain Colour, Taste, Smell, Figure and
Consistence having been observed to go together, are accounted one distinct Thing, signified
by the Name Apple. Other collections of Ideas constitute a Stone, a Tree, a Book, and the
like sensible Things; which, as they are pleasing or disagreeable, excite the Passions of Love,
Hatred, Joy, Grief, and so forth.

II. But besides all that endless variety of Ideas or Objects of Knowledge, there is likewise something which knows or perceives them, and exercises divers Operations, as Willing,
Imagining, Remembering about them. This perceiving, active Being is what I call Mind,
Spirit, Soul or my Self. By which Words I do not denote any one of my Ideas, but a thing
intirely distinct from them, wherein they exist, or, which is the same thing, whereby they are
perceived; for the Existence of an Idea consists in being perceived.

III. That neither our Thoughts, nor Passions, nor Ideas formed by the Imagination, exist
without the Mind, is what every Body will allow. And it seems no less evident that the
various Sensations or Ideas imprinted on the Sense, however blended or combined together
(that is, whatever Objects they compose) cannot exist otherwise than in a Mind perceiving
them. I think an intuitive Knowledge may be obtained of this, by any one that shall attend
to what is meant by the Term Exist when applied to sensible Things. The Table I write on,
I say, exists, that is, I see and feel it; and if I were out of my Study I should say it existed,
meaning thereby that if I was in my Study I might perceive it, or that some other Spirit actually does perceive it. There was an Odor, that is, it was smelled; There was a Sound,
that is to say, it was heard; a Colour or Figure, and it was perceived by Sight or Touch. This
is all that I can understand by these and the like Expressions. For as to what is said of the
absolute Existence of unthinking Things without any relation to their being perceived, that
seems perfectly unintelligible. Their Esse is Percipi, nor is it possible they should have any
Existence, out of the Minds or thinking Things which perceive them.

IV. It is indeed an Opinion strangely prevailing amongst Men, that Houses, Mountains,
Rivers, and in a word all sensible Objects have an Existence Natural or Real, distinct from
their being perceived by the Understanding. But with how great an Assurance and Acquiescence soever this Principle may be entertained in the World; yet whoever shall find in his
Heart to call it in Question, may, if I mistake not, perceive it to involve a manifest Contradiction. For what are the forementioned Objects but the things we perceive by Sense, and
what do we perceive besides our own Ideas or Sensations; and is it not plainly repugnant that
any one of these or any Combination of them should exist unperceived?

V. If we thoroughly examine this Tenet, it will, perhaps, be found at Bottom to depend
on the Doctrine of Abstract Ideas. For can there be a nicer Strain of Abstraction than to
distinguish the Existence of sensible Objects from their being perceived, so as to conceive
them Existing unperceived? Light and Colours, Heat and Cold, Extension and Figures, in
a word the Things we see and feel, what are they but so many Sensations, Notions, Ideas
or Impressions on the Sense; and is it possible to separate, even in thought, any of these
from Perception? For my part I might as easily divide a Thing from it Self. I may indeed
divide in my Thoughts or conceive apart from each other those Things which, perhaps, I
never perceived by Sense so divided. Thus I imagine the Trunk of a Humane Body without
the Limbs, or conceive the Smell of a Rose without thinking on the Rose it self. 

So far I will
not deny I can abstract, if that may properly be called Abstraction, which extends only to the
conceiving separately such Objects, as it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived
asunder. But my conceiving or imagining Power does not extend beyond the possibility of
real Existence or Perception. Hence as it is impossible for me to see or feel any Thing without
an actual Sensation of that Thing, so is it impossible for me to conceive in my Thoughts any
sensible Thing or Object distinct from the Sensation or Perception of it.

VI. Some Truths there are so near and obvious to the Mind, that a Man need only open
his Eyes to see them. Such I take this Important one to be, to wit, that all the Choir of Heaven
and Furniture of the Earth, in a word all those Bodies which compose the mighty Frame of
the World, have not any Subsistence without a Mind, that their Being is to be perceived
or known; that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me, or do not
exist in my Mind or that of any other created Spirit, they must either have no Existence
at all, or else subsist in the Mind of some eternal Spirit: It being perfectly unintelligible
and involving all the Absurdity of Abstraction, to attribute to any single part of them an
Existence independent of a Spirit. To be convinced of which, the Reader need only reflect and
try to separate in his own Thoughts the being of a sensible thing from its being perceived.

VII. From what has been said, it follows, there is not any other Substance than Spirit, or
that which perceives. But for the fuller proof of this Point, let it be considered, the sensible Qualities are Colour, Figure, Motion, Smell, Taste, and such like, that is, the Ideas perceived
by Sense. Now for an Idea to exist in an unperceiving Thing, is a manifest Contradiction; for
to have an Idea is all one as to perceive: that therefore wherein Colour, Figure, and the like
Qualities exist, must perceive them; hence it is clear there can be no unthinking Substance
or Substratum of those Ideas.

VIII. But say you, though the Ideas themselves do not exist without the Mind, yet
there may be Things like them whereof they are Copies or Resemblances, which Things exist
without the Mind, in an unthinking Substance. I answer, an Idea can be like nothing but
an Idea; a Colour or Figure can be like nothing but another Colour or Figure. If we look
but ever so little into our Thoughts, we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a Likeness
except only between our Ideas. Again, I ask whether those supposed Originals or external
Things, of which our Ideas are the Pictures or Representations, be themselves perceivable or
no? If they are, then they are Ideas, and we have gained our Point; but if you say they are
not, I appeal to any one whether it be Sense, to assert a Colour is like something which is
invisible; Hard or Soft, like something which is Intangible; and so of the rest.
