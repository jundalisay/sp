93. That impious and profane Persons should readily fall in with those Systems which
favour their Inclinations, by deriding immaterial Substance, and supposing the Soul to be
divisible and subject to Corruption as the Body; which exclude all Freedom, Intelligence,
and Design from the Formation of Things, and instead thereof make a self-existent, stupid,
unthinking Substance the Root and Origin of all Beings. That they should hearken to those
who deny a Providence, or Inspection of a superior Mind over the Affairs of the World,
attributing the whole Series of Events either to blind Chance or fatal Necessity, arising from
the Impulse of one Body on another. 

All this is very natural. And on the other hand, when
Men of better Principles observe the Enemies of Religion lay so great a Stress on unthinking
Matter, and all of them use so much Industry and Artifice to reduce every thing to it; methinks
they should rejoice to see them deprived of their grand Support, and driven from that only
Fortress, without which your Epicureans, Hobbists, and the like, have not even the Shadow
of a Pretence, but become the most cheap and easy Triumph in the World.
XCIV. The Existence of Matter, or Bodies unperceived, has not only been the main
Support of Atheists and Fatalists, but on the same Principle doth Idolatry likewise in all
its various Forms depend. Did Men but consider that the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and every
other Object of the Senses, are only so many Sensations in their Minds, which have no other
Existence but barely being perceived, doubtless they would never fall down, and worship
their own Ideas; but rather address their Homage to that Eternal Invisible Mind which
produces and sustains all Things.

XCV. The same absurd Principle, by mingling it self with the Articles of our Faith, hath
occasioned no small Difficulties to Christians. For Example, about the Resurrection, how
many Scruples and Objections have been raised by Socinians and others? But do not the
most plausible of them depend on the supposition, that a Body is denominated the same, with
regard not to the Form or that which is perceived by Sense, but the material Substance which
remains the same under several Forms? Take away this material Substance, about the Identity whereof all the Dispute is, and mean by Body what every plain ordinary Person means by
that Word, to wit, that which is immediately seen and felt, which is only a Combination of
sensible Qualities, or Ideas: And then their most unanswerable Objections come to nothing.
XCVI. Matter being once expelled out of Nature, drags with it so many sceptical and
impious Notions, such an incredible number of Disputes and puzling Questions, which have
been Thorns in the Sides of Divines, as well as Philosophers, and made so much fruitless
Work for Mankind; that if the Arguments we have produced against it, are not found equal
to Demonstration (as to me they evidently seem) yet I am sure all Friends to Knowledge,
Peace, and Religion, have reason to wish they were.

XCVII. Beside the external Existence of the Objects of Perception, another great Source
of Errors and Difficulties, with regard to Ideal Knowledge, is the Doctrine of abstract Ideas,
such as it hath been set forth in the Introduction. The plainest Things in the World, those
we are most intimately acquainted with, and perfectly know, when they are considered in
an abstract way, appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible. Time, Place, and Motion,
taken in particular or concrete, are what every Body knows; but having passed through the
Hands of a Metaphysician, they become too abstract and fine, to be apprehended by Men
of ordinary Sense. Bid your Servant meet you at such a Time, in such a Place, and he shall
never stay to deliberate on the meaning of those Words: In conceiving that particular Time
and Place, or the Motion by which he is to get thither, he finds not the least Difficulty. But
if Time be taken, exclusive of all those particular Actions and Ideas that diversify the Day,
merely for the Continuation of Existence, or Duration in Abstract, then it will perhaps gravel
even a Philosopher to comprehend it.

XCVIII. Whenever I attempt to frame a simple Idea of Time, abstracted from the succession of Ideas in my Mind, which flows uniformly, and is participated by all Beings, I am
lost and embrangled in inextricable Difficulties. I have no Notion of it at all, only I hear
others say, it is infinitely divisible, and speak of it in such a manner as leads me to entertain
odd Thoughts of my Existence: Since that Doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of
thinking, either that he passes away innumerable Ages without a Thought, or else that he is
annihilated every moment of his Life: Both which seem equally absurd. Time therefore being
nothing, abstracted from the Sucession of Ideas in our Minds, it follows that the Duration of
any finite Spirit must be estimated by the Number of Ideas or Actions succeeding each other
in that same Spirit or Mind. Hence it is a plain consequence that the Soul always thinks:
And in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his Thoughts, or abstract the Existence of
a Spirit from its Cogitation, will, I believe, find it no easy Task.

XCIX. So likewise, when we attempt to abstract Extension and Motion from all other
Qualities, and consider them by themselves, we presently lose sight of them, and run into
great Extravagancies. All which depend on a two-fold Abstraction: First, it is supposed that
Extension, for Example, may be abstracted from all other sensible Qualities; and Secondly,
that the Entity of Extension may be abstracted from its being perceived. But whoever shall
reflect, and take care to understand what he says, will, if I mistake not, acknowledge that all
sensible Qualities are alike Sensations, and alike real; that where the Extension is, there is the Colour too, to wit, in his Mind, and that their Archetypes can exist only in some other
Mind: And that the Objects of Sense are nothing but those Sensations combined, blended,
or (if one may so speak) concreted together: None of all which can be supposed to exist
unperceived.


100. What it is for a Man to be happy, or an Object good, every one may think he knows.
But to frame an abstract Idea of Happiness, prescinded from all particular Pleasure, or of
Goodness, from every thing that is good, this is what few can pretend to. So likewise, a Man
may be just and virtuous, without having precise Ideas of Justice and Virtue. The Opinion
that those and the like Words stand for general Notions abstracted from all particular Persons
and Actions, seems to have rendered Morality difficult, and the Study thereof of less use to
Mankind. And in effect, the Doctrine of Abstraction has not a little contributed towards
spoiling the most useful Parts of Knowledge.
