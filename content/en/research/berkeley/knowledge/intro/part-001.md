INTRODUCTION.

I. PHILOSOPHY being nothing else but the study of Wisdom and Truth, it may with
reason be expected, that those who have spent most Time and Pains in it should enjoy a
greater calm and serenity of Mind, a greater clearness and evidence of Knowledge, and be
less disturbed with Doubts and Difficulties than other Men. Yet so it is we see the Illiterate
Bulk of Mankind that walk the High-road of plain, common Sense, and are governed by
the Dictates of Nature, for the most part easy and undisturbed. To them nothing that’s
familiar appears unaccountable or difficult to comprehend. 

They complain not of any want
of Evidence in their Senses, and are out of all danger of becoming Sceptics. But no sooner
do we depart from Sense and Instinct to follow the Light of a Superior Principle, to reason,
meditate, and reflect on the Nature of Things, but a thousand Scruples spring up in our
Minds, concerning those Things which before we seemed fully to comprehend. Prejudices
and Errors of Sense do from all Parts discover themselves to our view; and endeavouring to
correct these by Reason we are insensibly drawn into uncouth Paradoxes, Difficulties, and
Inconsistencies, which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in Speculation; till at length,
having wander’d through many intricate Mazes, we find our selves just where we were, or,
which is worse, sit down in a forlorn Scepticism.

II. The cause of this is thought to be the Obscurity of things, or the natural Weakness
and Imperfection of our Understandings. It is said the Faculties we have are few, and those
designed by Nature for the Support and Comfort of Life, and not to penetrate into the inward
Essence and Constitution of Things. Besides, the Mind of Man being Finite, when it treats
of Things which partake of Infinity, it is not to be wondered at, if it run into Absurdities and
Contradictions; out of which it is impossible it should ever extricate it self, it being of the
nature of Infinite not to be comprehended by that which is Finite.

III. But perhaps we may be too partial to our selves in placing the Fault originally in our
Faculties, and not rather in the wrong use we make of them. It is a hard thing to suppose,
that right Deductions from true Principles should ever end in Consequences which cannot
be maintained or made consistent. We should believe that God has dealt more bountifully
with the Sons of Men, than to give them a strong desire for that Knowledge, which he had
placed quite out of their reach. This were not agreeable to the wonted, indulgent Methods of
Providence, which, whatever Appetites it may have implanted in the Creatures, doth usually
furnish them with such means as, if rightly made use of, will not fail to satisfy them. 

Upon
the whole, I am inclined to think that the far greater Part, if not all, of those Difficulties
which have hitherto amus’d Philosophers, and block’d up the way to Knowledge, are intirely
owing to our selves. That we have first rais’d a Dust, and then complain, we cannot see.

IV. My Purpose therefore is, to try if I can discover what those Principles are, which have
introduced all that Doubtfulness and Uncertainty, those Absurdities and Contradictions into the several Sects of Philosophy; insomuch that the Wisest Men have thought our Ignorance
incurable, conceiving it to arise from the natural dulness and limitation of our Faculties.
And surely it is a Work well deserving our Pains, to make a strict inquiry concerning the first
Principles of Humane Knowledge, to sift and examine them on all sides: especially since there
may be some Grounds to suspect that those Lets and Difficulties, which stay and embarass
the Mind in its search after Truth, do not spring from any Darkness and Intricacy in the
Objects, or natural Defect in the Understanding, so much as from false Principles which have
been insisted on, and might have been avoided.

V. How difficult and discouraging soever this Attempt may seem, when I consider how
many great and extraordinary Men have gone before me in the same Designs: Yet I am
not without some Hopes, upon the Consideration that the largest Views are not always the
Clearest, and that he who is Short-sighted will be obliged to draw the Object nearer, and
may, perhaps, by a close and narrow Survey discern that which had escaped far better Eyes.
VI. In order to prepare the Mind of the Reader for the easier conceiving what follows, it
is proper to premise somewhat, by way of Introduction, concerning the Nature and Abuse of
Language. But the unraveling this Matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my Design,
by taking notice of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering Speculation intricate
and perplexed, and to have occasioned innumerable Errors and Difficulties in almost all parts
of Knowledge. 

And that is the opinion that the Mind hath a power of framing Abstract Ideas
or Notions of Things. He who is not a perfect Stranger to the Writings and Disputes of
Philosophers, must needs acknowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract
Ideas. These are in a more especial manner, thought to be the Object of those Sciences which
go by the name of Logic and Metaphysics, and of all that which passes under the Notion of
the most abstracted and sublime Learning, in all which one shall scarce find any Question
handled in such a manner, as does not suppose their Existence in the Mind, and that it is
well acquainted with them.
