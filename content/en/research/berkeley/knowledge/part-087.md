87. Colour, Figure, Motion, Extension and the like, considered only as so many
Sensations in the Mind, are perfectly known, there being nothing in them which is not perceived. But if they are looked on as Notes or Images, referred to Things or Archetypes existing
without the Mind, then are we involved all in Scepticism. We see only the Appearances, and
not the real Qualities of Things.

What may be the Extension, Figure, or Motion of any thing
really and absolutely, or in it self, it is impossible for us to know, but only the proportion or
the relation they bear to our Senses. Things remaining the same, our Ideas vary, and which
of them, or even whether any of them at all represent the true Quality really existing in the
Thing, it is out of our reach to determine.

So that, for ought we know, all we see, hear, and
feel, may be only Phantom and vain Chimera, and not at all agree with the real Things, existing in Rerum Natura. All this Scepticism follows, from our supposing a difference between
Things and Ideas, and that the former have a Subsistence without the Mind, or unperceived.
It were easy to dilate on this Subject, and shew how the Arguments urged by Sceptics in all
Ages, depend on the Supposition of external Objects.


88. So long as we attribute a real Existence to unthinking Things, distinct from their being perceived, it is not only impossible for us to know with evidence the Nature of any
real unthinking Being, but even that it exists. Hence it is, that we see Philosophers distrust
their Senses, and doubt of the Existence of Heaven and Earth, of every thing they see or feel,
even of their own Bodies. 

And after all their labour and struggle of Thought, they are forced
to own, we cannot attain to any self-evident or demonstrative Knowledge of the Existence
of sensible Things. But all this Doubtfulness, which so bewilders and confounds the Mind,
and makes Philosophy ridiculous in the Eyes of the World, vanishes, if we annex a meaning
to our Words, and do not amuse our selves with the Terms Absolute, External, Exist, and
such like, signifying we know not what. I can as well doubt of my own Being, as of the Being of those Things which I actually perceive by Sense: It being a manifest Contradiction, that
any sensible Object should be immediately perceived by Sight or Touch, and at the same
time have no Existence in Nature, since the very Existence of an unthinking Being consists
in being perceived.


89. Nothing seems of more Importance, towards erecting a firm Systeme of sound
and real Knowledge, which may be proof against the Assaults of Scepticism, than to lay the
beginning in a distinct Explication of what is meant by Thing, Reality, Existence: For in
vain shall we dispute concerning the real Existence of Things, or pretend to any Knowledge
thereof, so long as we have not fixed the meaning of those Words. Thing or Being is the most
general Name of all, it comprehends under it two Kinds intirely distinct and heterogeneous,
and which have nothing common but the Name, to wit, Spirits and Ideas. The former are
active, indivisible Substances: The latter are inert, fleeting, dependent Beings, which subsist
not by themselves, but are supported by, or exist in Minds or spiritual Substances.

We
comprehend our own Existence by inward Feeling or Reflexion, and that of other Spirits by
Reason.

We may be said to have some Knowledge or Notion of our own Minds, of Spirits and
active Beings, whereof in a strict Sense we have not Ideas. In like manner we know and have
a Notion of relations between Things or Ideas, which relations are distinct from the Ideas or
Things related, inasmuch as the latter may be perceived by us without our perceiving the
former. To me it seems that Ideas, Spirits and Relations are all in their respective kinds, the
Object of humane Knowledge and Subject of Discourse: and that the Term Idea would be
improperly extended to signify every thing we know or have any Notion of.

XC. Ideas imprinted on the Senses are real Things, or do really exist; this we do not
deny, but we deny they can subsist without the Minds which perceive them, or that they
are Resemblances of any Archetypes existing without the Mind: Since the very Being of a
Sensation or Idea consists in being perceived, and an Idea can be like nothing but an Idea.
Again, the Things perceived by Sense may be termed external, with regard to their Origin,
in that they are not generated from within, by the Mind it self, but imprinted by a Spirit
distinct from that which perceives them. Sensible Objects may likewise be said to be without
the Mind, in another sense, namely when they exist in some other Mind. Thus when I shut
my Eyes, the Things I saw may still exist, but it must be in another Mind.

XCI. It were a mistake to think, that what is here said derogates in the least from the
Reality of Things. It is acknowledged on the received Principles, that Extension, Motion,
and in a word all sensible Qualities, have need of a Support, as not being able to subsist by
themselves. But the Objects perceived by Sense, are allowed to be nothing but Combinations
of those Qualities, and consequently cannot subsist by themselves. Thus far it is agreed on
all hands. So that in denying the Things perceived by Sense, an Existence independent of a
Substance, or Support wherein they may exist, we detract nothing from the received Opinion
of their Reality, and are guilty of no Innovation in that respect. All the difference is, that
according to us the unthinking Beings perceived by Sense, have no Existence distinct from
Being perceived, and cannot therefore exist in any other Substance, than those unextended,
indivisible Substances, or Spirits, which act, and think, and perceive them: Whereas Philosophers vulgarly hold, that the sensible Qualities exist in an inert, extended, unperceiving Substance, which they call Matter, to which they attribute a natural Subsistence, exterior
to all thinking Beings, or distinct from Being perceived by any Mind whatsoever, even the
eternal Mind of the Creator, wherein they suppose only Ideas of the corporeal Substances
created by him: If indeed they allow them to be at all created.


92. The Doctrine of Matter or corporeal Substance is the main Pillar and Support of Scepticism.

So likewise upon the same Foundation have been
raised all the impious Schemes of Atheism and Irreligion. Nay so great a difficulty hath it
been thought, to conceive Matter produced out of nothing, that the most celebrated among
the ancient Philosophers, even of these who maintained the Being of a God, have thought
Matter to be uncreated and coeternal with him. How great a Friend material Substance hath
been to Atheists in all Ages, were needless to relate. All their monstrous Systems have so
visible and necessary a dependence on it, that when this Corner-stone is once removed, the
whole Fabrick cannot choose but fall to the Ground; insomuch that it is no longer worth
while, to bestow a particular Consideration on the Absurdities of every wretched Sect of
Atheists.
