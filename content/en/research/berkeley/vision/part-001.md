Sect.
    1   Design
    2   Distance of itself invisible
    3   Remote distance perceived rather by experience than by sense
    4   Near distance thought to be perceived by the ANGLE of the OPTIC AXES
    5   Difference between this and the former manner of perceiving distance
    6   Also by diverging rays
    7   This depends not on experience
    8   These the common accounts, but not satisfactory
    9   Some IDEAS perceived by the mediation of others
   10   No IDEA which is not itself perceived, can be the means of perceiving another
   11   Distance perceived by means of some other IDEA
   12   Those lines and angles mentioned in optics, are not themselves perceived
   13   Hence the mind does not perceive distance by lines and angles
   14   Also because they have no real existence
   15   And because they are insufficient to explain the phenomena
   16   The IDEAS that suggest distance are, 1st, the sensation arising from the turn of the eyes
   17   Betwixt which and distance there is no necessary connection
   18   Scarce room for mistake in this matter
   19   No regard had to the angle of the OPTIC AXES
   20   Judgment of distance made with both eyes, the result of EXPERIENCE
   21   2ndly, Confusedness of appearance
   22   This the occasion of those judgments attributed to diverging rays
   23   Objection answered
   24   What deceives the writers of optics in this matter
   25   The cause why one IDEA may suggest another
   26   This applied to confusion and distance
   27   Thirrdly, the straining of the eye
   28   The occasions which suggest distance have in their own nature no relation to it
   29   A difficult case proposed by Dr. Barrow as repugnant to all the known theories
   30   This case contradicts a received principle in catoptrics
   31   It is shown to agree with the principles we have laid down
   32   This phenomenon illustrated
   33   It confirms the truth of the principle whereby it is explained
   34   Vision when distinct, and when confused
   35   The different effects of parallel diverging and converging rays
   36   How converging and diverging rays come to suggest the same distance
   37   A person extreme purblind would judge aright in the forementioned case
   38   Lines and angles, why useful in optics
   39   The not understanding this, a cause of mistake
   40   A query proposed, by Mr. Molyneux in his DIOPTRICS, considered
   41   One born blind would not at first have any IDEA of distance by sight
   42   This not agreeable to the common principles
   43   The proper objects of sight, not without the mind, nor the images of any thing without the mind
   44   This more fully explained
   45   In what sense we must be understood to see distance and external things
   46   Distance, and things placed at a distance, not otherwise perceived by the eye than by the ear
   47   The IDEAS of sight more apt to be confounded with the IDEAS of touch than those of hearing are
   48   How this comes to pass
   49   Strictly speaking, we never see and feel the same thing
   50   Objects of SIGHT twofold, mediate and immediate
   51   These hard to separate in our thoughts
   52   The received accounts of our perceiving magnitude by sight, false
   53   Magnitude perceived as immediately as distance
   54   Two kinds of sensible extension, neither of which is infinitely divisible
   55   The tangible magnitude of an OBJECT steady, the visible not
   56   By what means tangible magnitude is perceived by sight
   57   This further enlarged on
   58   No necessary connection between confusion or faintness of appearance, and small or great magnitude
   59   The tangible magnitude of an OBJECT more heeded than the visible, and why
   60   An instance of this
   61   Men do not measure by visible feet or inches
   62   No necessary connection between visible and tangible extension
   63   Greater visible magnitude might signify lesser tangible magnitude
   64   The judgments we make of magnitude depend altogether on experience
   65   Distance and magnitude seen as shame or anger
   66   But we are prone to think otherwise, and why
   67   The moon seems greater in the horizon than in the meridian
   68   The cause of this phenomenon assigned
   69   The horizontal moon, why greater at one time than another.
   70   The account we have given proved to be true
   71   And confirmed by the moon's appearing greater in a mist
   72   Objection answered
   73   The way wherein faintness suggests greater magnitude illustrated
   74   Appearance of the horizontal moon, why thought difficult to explain
   75   Attempts towards the solution of it made by several, but in vain
   76   The opinion of Dr. Wallis
   77   It is shown to be unsatisfactory
   78   How lines and angles may be of use in computing apparent magnitudes
   79   One born blind, being made to see, what judgment he would make of magnitude
   80   The MINIMUM VISIBLE the same to all creatures
   81   Objection answered
   82   The eye at all times perceives the same number of visible points
   83   Two imperfections in the VISIVE FACULTY
   84   Answering to which, we may conceive two perfections
   85   In neither of these two ways do microscopes improve the sight
   86   The case of microscopical eyes, considered
   87   The sight, admirably adapted to the ends of seeing
   88   Difficulty concerning erect vision
   89   The common way of explaining it
   90   The same shown to be false
   91   Not distinguishing between IDEAS of sight and touch, cause of mistake in this matter
   92   The case of one born blind, proper to be considered
   93   Such a one might by touch attain to have IDEAS of UPPER and LOWER
   94   Which modes of situation he would attribute only to things tangible
   95   He would not at first sight think anything he saw, high or low, erect or inverted
   96   This illustrated by an example
   97   By what means he would come to denominate visible OBJECTS, high or low, etc.
   98   Why he should think those OBJECTS highest, which are painted on the lowest part of his eye, and VICE VERSA
   99   How he would perceive by sight, the situation of external objects
  100   Our propension to think the contrary, no argument against what has been said
  101   Objection
  102   Answer
  103   An object could not be known at first sight by the colour
  104   Nor by the magnitude thereof
  105   Nor by the figure
  106   In the first act of vision, no tangible thing would be suggested by sight
  107   Difficulty proposed concerning number
  108   Number of things visible, would not at first sight suggest the like number of things tangible
  109   Number the creature of the mind
  110   One born blind would not at first sight number visible things as others do
  111   The situation of any object determined with respect only to objects of the same sense
  112   No distance, great or small, between a visible and tangible thing
  113   The not observing this, cause of difficulty in erect vision
  114   Which otherwise includes nothing unaccountable
  115   What is meant by the picture being inverted
  116   Cause of mistake in this matter
  117   Images in the eye, not pictures of external objects
  118   In what sense they are pictures
  119   In this affair we must carefully distinguish between ideas of sight and touch
  120   Difficult to explain by words the true Theory of Vision
  121   The question, whether there is any IDEA common to sight and touch, stated
  122   Abstract extension inquired into
  123   It is incomprehensible
  124   Abstract extension not the OBJECT of geometry
  125   The general IDEA of a triangle, considered
  126   Vacuum, or pure space, not common to sight and touch
  127   There is no idea, or kind of idea, common to both senses
  128   First argument in proof hereof
  129   Second argument
  130   Visible figure and extension, not distinct IDEAS from colour
  131   Third argument
  132   Confirmation drawn from Mr. Molyneux's problem of a sphere and a cube, published by Mr. Locke
  133   Which is falsely solved, if the common supposition be true
  134   More might be said in proof of our tenet, but this suffices
  135   Further reflection on the foregoing problem
  136   The same thing doth not affect both sight and touch
  137   The same idea of motion not common to sight and touch
  138   The way wherein we apprehend motion by sight, easily collected from what hath been said
  139   QU. How visible and tangible IDEAS came to have the same name if not of the same kind
  140   This accounted for without supposing them of the same kind
  141   OBJ. That a tangible square is liker to a visible square than to a visible circle
  142   ANS. That a visible square is fitter than a visible circle, to represent a tangible square
  143   But it doth not hence follow, that a visible square is like a tangible square
  144   Why we are more apt to confound visible with tangible IDEAS, than other signs with the things signified
  145   Several other reasons hereof, assigned
  146   Reluctancy in rejecting any opinion, no argument of its truth
  147   Proper objects of vision the language of nature
  148   In it there is much admirable, and deserving our attention
  149   Question proposed, concerning the object of geometry
  150   At first view we are apt to think visible extension the object of geometry
  151   Visible extension shown not to be the object of geometry
  152   Words may as well be thought the object of geometry, as visible extension
  153   It is proposed to inquire, what progress an intelligence that could see, but not feel, might make in geometry
  154   He cannot understand those parts which relate to solids, and their surfaces, and lines generated by their section
  155   Nor even the elements of plane geometry
  156   The proper objects of sight incapable of being managed as geometrical figures
  157   The opinion of those who hold plane figures to be the immediate objects of sight, considered
  158   Planes no more the immediate objects of sight, than solids
  159   Difficult to enter precisely into the thoughts of the above-mentioned intelligence
  160   The object of geometry, its not being sufficiently understood, cause of difficulty, and useless labour in that science

<!-- AN ESSAY TOWARDS A NEW THEORY OF VISION -->

1. My design is to show:

- how we perceive by sight the distance, magnitude, and situation of OBJECTS. 
- the difference between the IDEAS of sight and touch, and whether there be any IDEA common to both senses.

2. DISTANCE cannot be seen.

DISTANCE is a Line directed end-wise to the eye. It projects only one point in the fund of the eye, which point remains invariably the same, whether the distance be longer or shorter.

3. Our estimate of the distance of distant OBJECTS is an act of judgment grounded on EXPERIENCE than of SENSE.

For example, when I perceive a great number of intermediate OBJECTS, such as houses, fields, rivers, and the like, which I have experienced to take up a considerable space, I thence form a judgment or conclusion that the OBJECT I see beyond them is at a great distance. 

When an OBJECT appears faint and small, which at a near distance I have experienced to make a vigorous and large appearance, I instantly conclude it to be far off: And this, it is evident, is the result of EXPERIENCE; without which, from the faintness and littleness I should not have inferred anything concerning the distance of OBJECTS.


4. But when an OBJECT is placed at so near a distance as that the interval between the eyes bears any sensible proportion to it, the opinion of speculative men is that the two OPTIC AXES (the fancy that we see only with one eye at once being exploded) concurring at the OBJECT do there make an ANGLE, by means of which, according as it is greater or lesser, the OBJECT is perceived to be nearer or farther off.

5. Betwixt which and the foregoing manner of estimating distance there is this remarkable difference: that whereas there was no apparent, necessary connection between small distance and a large and strong appearance, or between great distance and a little and faint appearance, there appears a very necessary connection between an obtuse angle and near distance, and an acute angle and farther distance. It does not in the least depend upon experience, but may be evidently known by anyone before he had experienced it, that the nearer the concurrence of the OPTIC AXES, the greater the ANGLE, and the remoter their concurrence is, the lesser will be the ANGLE comprehended by them.

6. There is another way mentioned by optic writers, whereby they will have us judge of those distances, in respect of which the breadth of the PUPIL hath any sensible bigness: And that is the greater or lesser divergency of the rays, which issuing from the visible point do fall on the PUPIL, that point being judged nearest which is seen by most diverging rays, and that remoter which is seen by less diverging rays: and so on, the apparent distance still increasing, as the divergency of the rays decreases, till at length it becomes infinite, when the rays that fall on the PUPIL are to sense parallel. And after this manner it is said we perceive distance when we look only with one eye.

7. In this case also it is plain we are not beholding to experience: it being a certain, necessary truth that the nearer the direct rays falling on the eye approach to a PARALLELISM, the farther off is the point of their intersection, or the visible point from whence they flow.

8. I have here set down the common, current accounts that are given of our perceiving near distances by sight, which, though they are unquestionably received for true by MATHEMATICIANS, and accordingly made use of by them in determining the apparent places of OBJECTS, do, nevertheless seem to me very unsatisfactory: and that for these following reasons:—

9. FIRST, It is evident that when the mind perceives any IDEA, not immediately and of itself, it must be by the means of some other IDEA. Thus, for instance, the passions which are in the mind of another are of themselves to me invisible. I may nevertheless perceive them by sight, though not immediately, yet by means of the colours they produce in the countenance. We often see shame or fear in the looks of a man, by perceiving the changes of his countenance to red or pale.

10. Moreover it is evident that no IDEA which is not itself perceived can be the means of perceiving any other IDEA. If I do not perceive the redness or paleness of a man's face themselves, it is impossible I should perceive by them the passions which are in his mind.

11. Now from sect. 2 it is plain that distance is in its own nature imperceptible, and yet it is perceived by sight. It remains, therefore, that it be brought into view by means of some other IDEA that is itself immediately perceived in the act of VISION.

12. But those LINES and ANGLES, by means whereof some MATHEMATICIANS pretend to explain the perception of distance, are themselves not at all perceived, nor are they in truth ever thought of by those unskilful in optics. I appeal to anyone's experience whether upon sight of an OBJECT he computes its distance by the bigness of the ANGLE made by the meeting of the two OPTIC AXES? Or whether he ever thinks of the greater or lesser divergency of the rays, which arrive from any point to his PUPIL? Everyone is himself the best judge of what he perceives, and what not. In vain shall all the MATHEMATICIANS in the world tell me, that I perceive certain LINES and ANGLES which introduce into my mind the various IDEAS of DISTANCE, so long as I myself am conscious of no such thing.

13. Since, therefore, those ANGLES and LINES are not themselves perceived by sight, it follows from sect. 10 that the mind doth not by them judge of the distance of OBJECTS.
