Sea urchin

(3) Fistulides. Elongated body, an irritable and mobile skin; an anus

Holothuria
Sipunculus

Remarks. The sipunculus are animals very close to worms. However their known affinities with the holothuria have led them to be placed among the radiates, with which they no longer share characteristics. Consequently, they must come at the end.

In general, in a really natural distribution, the first and the last genera of classes are those in which the classical characteristics are less pronounced. Because they come at the limits of the class and the lines of separation are artificial, these genera must display to a lesser extent than the others the characteristics of their class.

WORMS

(Fourth Class in the Animal Kingdom)

Suboviparous animals, with soft elongated bodies, without a head, eyes, limbs, or bunches of setae; without circulation and with a complete intestinal canal (one with two openings).  Mouth made up of one or several suckers.

Observations

The general form of worms is very different from that of the radiates. Their mouths, always a sucker, has no similarity to those of the polyps, which display only an aperture accompanied by radiating tentacles or rotatory organs.

Worms have, in general, an elongated body, very slightly contractile, although very soft, and their intestinal canal is not limited to a single opening.

In the fistulid radiates, nature began to abandon the radiating form of the parts and to give animal bodies an elongated shape, the only one which might lead to the goal which nature set for herself.

Once nature created the worms, she is going to tend from that point on to establish the pattern of the paired symmetry of parts, which she could not attain except by an articulated design. But in the class of worms, which is ambiguous to some extent, she has only sketched out a few traits.

Third Stage of Organic Structure

Nerves ending in a longitudinal ganglionic chord; respiration by aerated trachaea; no circulation (or imperfect).

[The Insects and Arachnids]

INSECTS

(Fifth Class of the animal kingdom)

Oviparous animals, undergoing metamorphoses, able to have wings, and possessing, in the perfect state, six articulated limbs, two antennae, two faceted eyes, and a horny skin.  Respiration by aerated trachaea which extend to all the parts; no system of circulation; two distinct sexes; one single reproductive act in a lifetime.

Observations

Having reached the insects, we find among the extremely numerous animals which this class includes a very different order of things from the classes which we have have encountered in the animals of the four preceding classes.  Moreover, in the place of modulations in the progressive complexity of the organic structure in animals, once we arrive at the insects, in this matter we have made quite a considerable leap.

Here, for the first time, the animals examined from the outside show us a true head which is always distinct, very remarkable eyes (although still very imperfect), articulated limbs arranged in two rows, and the symmetrical form of paired and opposing parts which nature will use from this point on right up to and including the most perfect animals.

When we move to the interior of insects, we see in addition a complete nervous system, consisting of nerves which end a a longitudinal ganglionic chord.  Although complete, this nervous system is still very imperfect.  The area where the sensations meet appears very fractured, and the senses themselves are few and very obscure.  Finally, we see in the interior of the insect a real muscular system and distinct sexes, which, however, can provide only a single fertilization (as with the plants).

True, we do not yet find a circulatory system, and it is necessary to go higher in the animal chain to find this improvement in organic structure.

The property of all insects is having wings in their perfect state, so that those which lack them have been deprived only by an abortion which has become habitual and constant.

Observations

In the table which I am going to present, the genera have been reduced to a number considerably lower that that of the genera which people have made from the animals in this class.  Interest in studying the subject and the simplicity and the clarity of the method seemed to me to demand this reduction, which is not going to harm at all an understanding of the objects.  To use all the particular details which one could seize upon in the characteristics of animals and plants in order to multiply genera to infinity is, as I have already said, to clutter up and obscure science instead of serving it.  It makes the study of science so complicated and difficult, that it would become impossible to practice it, except for those who wished to dedicate their entire lives to learning the immense nomenclature and the minute characteristics used to make distinctions among animals.
