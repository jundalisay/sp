 <!-- and the structure we must give to their general distribution so that it conforms to the very order of nature. -->
 
Chapter 5 said that the essential aim of a distribution of animals must not limit itself to the possession of a list of classes, genera, and species. 

This distribution must display the means most favorable to the study of nature.

<!-- , something which is most relevant to make us understand her progress, her means, and her laws. -->

However, our general distributions of animals today have a structure which reverses the very order nature.

 <!-- followed in giving rise successively to her living productions.  -->

It moves from the most complex towards the most simple.
- This makes the learning of the composition of organic structure more difficult to grasp.

We perceive less easily:
- the causes of this progress
- the interruptions in it

When we realize that something is useful, we hurriedly make use of it, even though it is contrary to custom.

<!-- , even that it is indispensable for the goal we propose and that there is nothing inconvenient about it,  -->

<!-- Such is the case concerning the structure which we must give to the general disposition of animals. -->

<!-- It is not at all an indifferent matter to begin this general distribution of animals at either one of its extremities and that what should come at the start of the order cannot be simply a matter of our choice. -->

The current custom is to put:
- at the head of the animal kingdom the most perfect animals
- at the end the least perfect and simplest

This is from our tendency to give precedence to the objects which we find striking, pleasing, or interesting.
- We have preferred to move from the best known towards the least known.


<!-- At the time when people began to occupy themselves with the study of natural history,  -->

These considerations were very persuasive.

But they should yield now to scientific needs, particularly to the need to facilitate our progress in the understanding of nature.

<!-- With respect to animals which nature has succeeded in producing, so numerous and so varied, if we cannot boast of knowing exactly the true order which nature followed in bringing them successively into existence, what I am going to reveal is probably very close to that order. 

Reason and all the knowledge we have acquired encourage this probability.

In fact, if it is true that all living bodies are productions of nature, we cannot refuse to believe that she could produce them only successively, not all at once at a specific moment. Now, if she created them one after the other, there is reason to believe that she began  -->

Nature began exclusively with the simplest structures.

 <!-- and did not produce the most complex organic structures (in both the animal and plant kingdoms) until the end, -->

Botanists first gave zoologists the example of the true arrangement we should give to a general distribution in order to represent the very order of nature. For they formed the first class of plants with the acotyledonous or agamous plants, that is, with the structurally simplest plants, the most imperfect in every respect, in a word, with those which had no cotyledons, no determinable sex, no vessels in their tissues, plants which are, in fact, composed only of cellular tissue more or less modified according to different extensions.

What the botanists have done with respect to plants, we should finally do with the animal kingdom, not only because nature herself points in that direction and reason demands it, but also because the natural order of classes, according to the growing complexity in organic structure, is much easier to determine among the animals than it is with respect to plants.

While this order will better set down the order of nature, it will at the same time make the study of objects much easier, will improve our understanding of the organic structure of animals, the progress in its complexity from class to class, and will demonstrate even better the affinities existing between the different degrees in the make up of animal organization and the external difference which we most frequently use to characterize the classes, orders, families, genera, and species.

I add to these two considerations (whose basis one cannot seriously call into question) the fact that if nature, incapable of making organic structures which survive for ever, had not had the means of giving these bodies the capacity of reproducing themselves with other individuals which resembled them, replaced them, and perpetuate the race by the same means, she would have been forced to create directly all the races or rather she would have been able to create only one race in each organic order, one for the simplest and most imperfect animals and one for the simplest and most imperfect plants.

In addition, if nature had not been capable of the active processes of organization with the ability to make that very organic structure more and more complex, by increasing the mobile energy of fluid movement and thus organic movement, and if she had not preserved through reproduction all the progress in the composition of organic structures and all the acquired improvements, she should assuredly never have produced this multitude of infinitely varied animals and plants, so different from each other in the condition of their organic structures and capacities.

Finally, she would not have been able to create right at the first the most eminent animal faculties, for they do not arise except with the help of very complex organic systems. Nature had to prepare gradually the means of bringing into existence such organic systems.

Thus, to establish, with respect to living bodies, the state of things which we observe, the only thing nature had to produce directly (that is, without the combination of any organic action) was the simplest organic bodies, whether animals or plants. And she still reproduces these in the same way, every day, in favorable places and seasons. Now, by giving to these bodies which she herself created the capacity to feed themselves, to grow, to multiply, and to preserve each time the improvements they acquired in their organic structure and, finally, by passing on these same capacities to all the individuals produced by organic reproduction, over time, given the enormous diversity of always changing circumstances, the living bodies of all the classes and every order were, through these means, produced one after the other.

In considering the natural order of animals, the very marked gradation which exists in the growing complexity of their organic structure and the number as well as the improvement of their faculties is far from being a new truth, for even the Greeks were able to perceive it (1). But they were not able to lay bare the principles and proofs, because people then lacked the knowledge necessary to establish them.

Now, in order to facilitate the knowledge of the principles which have guided me in the exposition which I am about to make concerning this order of animals, and to better render perceptible this gradation which we observe in the complexity of their organic structure, from the most imperfect among them, who are at the head of the series, right up to the most perfect which conclude the series, I have divided into six very distinct stages all the styles of organic structure which we have recognized in the entire extent of the animal ladder.

Of these six stages, the four first ones include the animals without vertebrae, and hence the first ten classes of the animal kingdom, according to the new order which we are going to follow; the two last stages include all the vertebrate animals, and thus the four (or five) final classes of animals.

With the assistance of this method, it will be easy to study and to follow the march of nature in the production of the animals she has brought into existence, to distinguish, throughout the whole extent of the animal ladder, the progress attained in the complexity of organic structure, and to verify throughout the precision of the distribution or the appropriateness of the assigned ranks, by examining the known characteristics and facts of organic structure.

This is the way in which for several years in my lessons at the Museum I set out the invertebrates, always proceeding from the most simple towards the most complex.

In order to make the arrangement and the totality of the general series of animals more distinct, let us first present a table of the fourteen classes dividing the animal kingdom, limiting ourselves to a very simple exposition of their characteristics and the stages of organic structure which they include.


<!-- Table of the Distribution and Classification of Animals,

Following the order which conforms most closely to the order of nature


INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS
