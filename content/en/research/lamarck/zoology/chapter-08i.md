FOURTH ORDER: CHELONIAN REPTILES

Heart with a double auricle; body equipped with a carapace and four limbs; no teeth in the jaw bones

Chelonia
Chelys

Emys
Tortoise

SIXTH DEGREE OF ORGANIC STRUCTURE

Nerves ending at a spinal chord and a brain which fills the cranial case; heart with two ventricles and warm blood.

[Birds and Mammals]

BIRDS

(Thirteenth Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous animals, vertebrates and with warm blood; breathing completely by adhering and pierced lungs; four articulated limbs, two of which are shaped as wings; feathers on the skin.

Observations

The birds certainly have an organic structure more perfect than the reptiles and all the animals of the preceding classes, because they have warm blood, a heart with two ventricles, and their brain fills the cranial case, characteristics which they share only with the more perfect animals which make up the last class.

However, birds evidently form only the penultimate rung of the animal ladder, for they are less perfect than the mammals, since they are still oviparous, lack mammary glands, lack a diaphragm, a bladder, and so on, and since they have fewer faculties.

In the table which follows, one can notice that the four first orders include the birds whose young cannot walk or feed themselves when they hatch and, by contrast,  the three last orders include the birds whose young move and feed themselves as soon as they emerge from the egg.  Finally, the seventh order, that of the palimpeds, seems to me to show birds who, through their affinities, come closest to the animals of the class which follows.

MONOTREMES (Geoff.)

Animals intermediate between the birds and the mammals; these animals are quadrupeds, without mammary glands, without teeth in the jaws, without lips, and with only one orifice for the genital organs, feces and urine; their body is covered with hair or bristles

Ornithorhynchus
Echidna

Note: I have already spoken of these animals in Chapter VI, where I showed that they are neither mammals, nor birds, nor reptiles.

MAMMALS

(Fourteenth Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Viviparous animals with mammary glands; four articulated limbs, or only two; respiration entirely by lungs which are not pierced on the outside; hair on some parts of the body.

Observations

In the order of nature, which clearly proceeds from the simplest towards the most complex in its workings on living bodies, the mammals necessarily make up the last class of the animal kingdom.

This class effectively includes the most perfect animals, those which have the most faculties, the most intelligence, and finally, the most complex organic structure.

These animals whose structure comes closest the that of man display for this reasons a combination of senses and faculties more perfect than all the others.  They are the only ones which are truly viviparous and which have mammary glands to suckle their young.

Thus, the mammals display the most significant complexity in the organic structure of animals, and represent the limit in the perfectioning and in the number of faculties which nature, with the help of this organic structure, was able to give to living bodies.  Therefore, they must come at the end of the immense series of existing animals
