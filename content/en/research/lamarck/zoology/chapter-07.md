<!-- First Part

Considerations of the Natural History of Animals, Their Characteristics, Their Interrelationships, Their Organic Structure, Their Distribution, Their Classification and Their Species -->

 
<!-- The Influence of the Actions and Habits of these Living Bodies As Causes Which Modify Their Organic Structure and Their Parts -->

What we are now concerned with is not a rational speculation but the examination of a reliable fact, a more universal one than people think and something to which we have neglected to pay the attention it deserves. 

This is the case because on most occasions.

 <!-- it is very difficult to recognize. This fact consists of the influence which circumstances exert on the different living things subject to them. -->

In truth, for quite a long time now we have noticed the influence of the different states of our organic structure on our characteristics, inclinations, actions, and even our ideas. 

But it seems to me that no one has get made known the influence of our actions and habits on our own organic structure. Now, as these actions and habits are entirely dependent on the circumstances in which we usually find ourselves, I am going to try to show how great the influence is which these circumstances exert on the general form, the condition of the parts, and even on the organic structure of living things. 

Thus, this chapter is going to explore this very well established fact.


If we had not had numerous occasions to recognize quite clearly the effects of this influence on certain living bodies which we have transported into entirely new environments, very different from the ones where they used to live, and if we had not seen these effects and the changes resulting from them come to light in some way under our very eyes, the important fact under discussion would have always remained unknown to us.

The influence of circumstances is working always and everywhere on living bodies. 

But its effects become perceptible only after a long time.

<!-- Before laying out and examining the proofs for this noteworthy fact (something extremely important for Zoological Philosophy), let us summarize the thread of the ideas with which we started our analysis. -->

When we consider the animal scale in a sense opposite to the natural direction, we find that in the groups which form this scale there exists a sustained but irregular degradation in the organic structure of animals making up the groups, an increasing simplicity in the organization of living bodies and finally a corresponding diminution in the number of faculties in these beings.

This well known fact can provide us the greatest insights into the very order which nature followed in the production of all animals which she has brought into existence. But it does not show us why animals' organic structure, with its increasing complexity from the most imperfect right to the most improved, only displays an irregular gradation in which the range manifests a number of anomalies or gaps which have no apparent order amid their variety.

What is the reason for this peculiar irregularity in the growing complexity of animals' organic structure?

if we consider the results of the influences which the infinitely various circumstances in all the regions of the earth exert on the general shape, parts, and even the organic structure of these animals, then everything will be clearly explained.

The condition of every animal is the product of:
- the increasing complexity in organic structure which tends to create a regular gradation
- influences of many different circumstances
  - These continuously tend to work against the regularity in the gradations of the growing complexity in organization.

Circumstances have an influence on the form and the organic structure of animals. 

<!-- What this means is that by undergoing significant change, the circumstances proportionally alter, over time, both the form and the organic structure itself -->

<!-- True, if someone takes these expressions literally, he would say I was making a mistake. For no matter what the circumstances can be, they do not work to bring about directly any modification whatsoever in the shape and organic structure in animals. -->

But significant changes in the circumstances lead, for animals, to great changes in their needs. 

Such changes in the needs necessarily lead to changes in their actions. Now, if the new needs become constant or last a long time, the animals then acquire new habits which are just as long lasting as the needs which brought them about. That is what is easy to demonstrate and, indeed, requires no detailed explanation to be understood.

Thus, it is clear that a significant change in circumstances, once it becomes constant for a race of animals, leads these animals to new habits.

Now, if new circumstances have become permanent for a race of animals and have given these animals new habits, that is, have driven them to new actions which have become customary, that will result in the preferential use of one part over another and, in some cases, in the total disuse of some part which has become useless.

This is not a hypothetical nor an odd opinion. 

It is a truth which requires only the attentive observation of facts.

After a new need becomes essential, they effectively, by a sequence of efforts, give rise to that part.

Later, its sustained use gradually strengthens and develops it.

Finally, it finishes up by increasing its size considerably. 

On the other hand, we shall see that in some cases, the new circumstances and needs made some part totally useless. 

The total lack of use of this part brought it about that it gradually ceased undergoing the development experienced by the other parts. 

Thus, it grew smaller and weaker gradually, and finally, when this lack of use had been complete for a long time, the part in question ended up disappearing. 

In the plants where there are no actions and consequently, no habits, significant changes in circumstances nonetheless lead to significant differences in the development of their parts. 

As a result, these different circumstances give rise to and develop certain parts, while they weaken several other parts and lead to their disappearance. 

But here everything exerts its effect through changes undergone in what the plant uses for nourishment, in what it absorbs and breathes, in the quality of heat, light, air, and humidity which the plant customarily then receives, and, finally, through the superiority which some of these various vital movements can gain over others.

Among individuals of the same species, if some are continually well nourished in circumstances favourable to their total development, while others find themselves in opposite circumstances, then there is produced a difference between the conditions of these individuals which gradually becomes very noticeable. 

How many examples I could cite concerning animals and plants which confirm the basis for this idea!

If circumstances remain the same, making the condition of the poorly nourished individuals habitual and constant, with suffering and malnourishment, their interior organic structure is finally changed. 

Reproduction among the individuals in question preserves the acquired modifications and ends up by giving rise to a race very different from the one made up of individuals who find themselves constantly in circumstances favourable to their development.

A very dry spring causes prairie grasses to grow very little, to remain thin and scrawny, to flower and bear fruit, although they have grown very little.

A spring mixed with hot days and rainy days brings about in these same grasses a generous growth, and the harvest of hay is then excellent.

But if with these plants some causes perpetuate unfavourable circumstances, they will vary proportionally, at first in their bearing or their general condition, and later in several specific characteristics.

For example, if a grain of some prairie grass or other is carried into a high place, onto a dry, arid, and rocky patch of land very exposed to the wind and can germinate there, the plant which can live in this place will always find itself malnourished, and if the individuals which it produces continue to exist in these poor circumstances, there will result a race truly different from the one which lives in the prairie (which is, however, the origin of the second race). 

The individuals of this new race will be small, scrawny in their parts, and some of their organs, having undergone more development than others, will then manifest strange proportions.

Those who have observed a great deal and consulted large collections have been convinced that as the conditions in the environment, exposure, climate, nourishment, way of life, and so on undergo changes, the characteristics of height, shape, proportions among the parts, colour, consistency, agility, and industry (for the animals) correspondingly change.

What nature does with a great deal of time, we do every day, when on our own we suddenly change the conditions in which a living plant and all the individuals of its species are found.
