My Personal Conclusion is that  Nature produces in succession all the animal species.

It begins with the most imperfect or the simplest.

Gradually, it makes the organic structure more complicated.

as these animals generally spread out into all the habitable regions of the world, from the influence of the circumstances which each species encountered, it acquired the habits which we know in it and the modifications in its parts which observation reveals to us in that species.

The first of these conclusions is the one which people have drawn up to the present time, that is to say, that it has been just about universal. It assumes in each animal a constant organic structure and parts which have never varied and which will never vary; 

It further assumes that the circumstances in the places where each species of animals dwells never varies in these locations; for if they did vary, the same animals would no longer be alive and the possibility of finding other similar circumstances and of transporting themselves there would be forbidden to them.

The second conclusions is my own.  

It assumes that through the influence of circumstances on habits and later the influence of habits on the condition of the parts and even on the condition of the organic structure, each animal can undergo in its parts and organic structure modifications capable of becoming really significant. This has given rise to the condition in which we find all the animals.

To establish that this second conclusion is groundless, it is first necessary to prove that each point on the surface of the earth never varies its nature, exposure, lofty or low elevation, its climate, and so on and so on, and, beyond that, to show that no part of animals undergoes, even with the passage of a great deal of time, any modification occasioned by a change in its circumstances and by the necessity which forces them to a style of life and action different from what is habitual to them.

Now, if a single fact confirms that an animal which has been domesticated for a long time differs from the wild species from which it originated and if, in such a domesticated species, we find a great structural differences between individuals which we have subjected to some habit and those whom we have forced into different habits, then it will be certain that the first conclusion does not conform at all to natural laws and that, by contrast, the second is perfectly in accordance with them.

Thus, everything comes together to establish my assertion that is is not the form (wether of the body or the parts) which gives rise to the habits and the manner of living in animals.

In contrast, it is the habits, the manner of life, and all the other influential circumstances which have, over time, shaped the form of the body and the parts of animals. 

With new shapes, new faculties were acquired, and gradually nature came to the point of creating the animals such as we see them now.

Could there be in natural history a more important conclusion, one to which we ought to give more attention, than the one with I have just revealed?

<!-- Let us conclude this first part with the principles and the exposition of the natural order of animals. -->



## Notes to Chapter Seven

(1) Physicists think and even state that atmospheric air is the unique medium for sound, that is to say, that it is the air which, set in motion by the shocks or the vibrations of bodies, transmits to the organ of the ear the impressions of the oscillations which it has received.

That this view is an error is confirmed by a number of known facts which prove that it is impossible for air to penetrate to all regions where the material producing sound actually does penetrate.

See my Memorandum on the substance of sound, printed at the end of my Hydrogeology, p. 225, in which I have set forth the proofs of this mistake.

Since the publication of my memorandum (which people have been reluctant to refer to) great efforts have been made to reconcile the known velocity for the propagation of sound in air with the sluggishness of the air particles which makes the propagation of these oscillations too slow to equal this speed.  Now, since the air in its oscillations necessarily undergoes successive compression and dilation in parts of its mass, people have used the products of the calories given off in the sudden compression of air and of those absorbed in the rarefaction of this fluid.  Thus, by using the results of these products and their size, as determined by appropriate hypotheses, geometricians now provide a rational basis for the speed with which sound propagates itself in air.  But that does not square at all with facts which confirm that sound propagates itself through bodies which air is incapable of moving through or of setting any of its parts in motion.

In fact, the assumption concerning the vibration of the smallest parts of solid bodies is a very doubtful oscillation which cannot propagate itself except in homogeneous bodies with the same density and cannot extend from a dense body into a rarefied body, nor from the latter into another very dense body.  This assumption cannot be reconciled with the well known fact about the propagation of sound through heterogeneous bodies with different densities and very different natures. [Back to Text]
