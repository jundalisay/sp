This order is placed here only because of the relationship of the general form of the anmals which make it up.  See my  observations on p. 143.

Naturalists who have considered man solely with respect to his organic structure have formed out of the six known varieties a particular genus, so that man alone makes up a separate family, characterized in the following way:
