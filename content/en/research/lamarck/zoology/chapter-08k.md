BIMANES

Mammals with separate limbs with nails; three types of teeth and opposable thumbs only on the hands

Man

Varieties

Caucasian
Hyperborean
Mongolian
American
Malayan
Ethiopian or Negro

The name bimanes has been given to this family because, in effect, only human hands display a thumb separated and opposing the digits, while in the quadrumanes, the hands and the feet show this same characteristic, so far as the thumb is concerned.

Some Observations Relevant to Men

If man were distinguished from animals only with respect to his organic structure, it would be easy to show that the characteristics of organic structure which one would use to form a separate family (with its varieties) are all the products of ancient changes in his actions and habits which he acquired and what have become special to the individuals of his species.

In fact, if some race or other of quadrumanes, above all the most perfected among them, were to lose (by necessity of circumstance or some other cause) the habit of climbing up trees and grasping branches with their feet, as with their hands, to hang on there, and if the individuals of this race, over a succession of generations, were forced to use their feet only for movement and stopped using their hands as feet, there is no doubt, after the observations revealed in the preceding chapter, that these quadrumanes would finally be transformed into bimanes and that the thumbs on their feet would cease to be separated from the digits, since these feet serve them only for movement.

Moreover, if the individuals I am talking about, moved by the need to grow higher so as to see all at once far and wide, were forced to hold themselves upright and acquired from that a constant habit from one generation to the next, there is no doubt once again that their feet would have insensibly taken on a shape appropriate for holding them in an upright position, that their limbs would acquire calves, and that these animals could only move around with difficulty on their hands and feet at the same time.

Finally, if these same individual were to stop using their jaws as weapons for biting, tearing, or seizing, or like pincers for cutting grass to eat, and if they were used only for chewing, once more there is no doubt that their facial angle would become more open, that their muzzle would shorten more and more, and would be finally effaced and they would have vertical incisor teeth.

Suppose now that a race of quadrumanes, like the most perfect, having acquired by constant habits in all its individuals the form which I have just referred to and the faculty of standing erect and walking upright and that later this race succeeded in dominating the other races of animals.  In such a case one will see the following:

1. This race, more perfect in its capabilities,  having because of these finally come to master the others, will spread itself out over the surface of the earth into all places which are suitable for it.

2. This race will have chased off the other prominent races and, in the event of a dispute about what the good the earth offers, it would have forced them to take refuge in places which this race does not occupy.

3. By harming the large multiplication of the races close to it in their affinities and having relegated them to the woods or other deserted places, this race will have stopped the progress in the perfection of their faculties; while that race itself,  capable of extending itself everywhere, will multiply there without obstacles from the others and live there in numerous troops; it will have successively created new needs which will stimulate its industry and gradually perfect its methods and capabilities.

4. Finally, this preeminent race, having acquired an absolute supremacy over all the others, will have succeeded at putting between itself and the most perfect animals some difference and, in one way or another, a considerable distance.

Thus, the race of the most perfect quadarumanes will have been able to become dominant, to change its habits as a result of the absolute empire which it will have taken over the others and of new needs, and from that to acquire progressively modifications in its organic structure and numerous new capabilities, to restrict the most perfect of the other races to the state at which they have arrived; and to introduce very remarkable distinctions between itself and the latter.

The Orang of Angola (Simia troglodytes, Lin.) is the most perfect of animals: it is much more so than the orang of the Indies (Simia satyrus, Lin.), which has been called the orang-outang.  Nevertheless, with respect to their organic structure, they are both far inferior to man in coporeal faculties and in intelligence (3).  These animals hold themselves upright on many occasions, but since they have not developed this into a sustained habit, their organic structure has not been sufficiently modified, so that standing up is a very inconvenient and uncomfortable condition for them.

We know (by accounts of travelers) above all in connection with the orang of the Indies, that when a pressing danger obliges them to run away, the animal immediately falls back onto its four limbs.  According to us, that reveals the true origin of this animal, because it is forced to abandon this strange bearing which is foreign to it.

Without doubt this upright bearing is foreign to the animal, since it makes less use of it when it moves about .  Hence its organic structure is less appropriate for such a stance.  But because that stance is  easier for man, is it entirely natural to him?

For man who, through the sustained habits of the individuals in his species over a long sequence of generations, can hold himself upright as he moves around, this stance is nonetheless a tiring state for him, a condition in which he is not able to sustain himself except for a limited time and with aid of the contractions of several of his muscles.

If the verbebral column of the human body were to form the axis of the body and to hold the head at equilibrium, as well as the other parts, man would be able to be in a state of repose while upright.  Now, we all know that that is not the case, that the head does not move itself at the body's centre of gravity, that the chest and the stomach, as well as the viscera which these cavities enclose, weigh down almost totally on the front part of the vertebral column, that this column itself rests upon an oblique base, and so on.  Thus, as Richerand observes, it is necessary that while man is standing, an active power constantly keep watch to prevent the falls which the weight and the distribution of the parts always tend to encourage in the body.

After having developed the matters relevant to the stance of man, the same scholar explained himself as follows: "The relative weights of the head, the abdominal and thoracic viscera thus tend to pull forward that line, as a result of which all the parts of the body weigh on the plane which maintains it, a line which should be exactly perpendicular to this plane so that the stance is perfect.  The following fact lends support to this assertion. I have observed that the children whose head is voluminous, the belly jutting forward, and the viscera overfull with fat accustom themselves to standing upright with difficulty.  It is hardly at the end of their second year when they dare to trust their own powers.  They remain subject to frequent falls and have a natural tendency to reassume the condition of a quadruped." Physiology, vol. II, p. 268.

This arrangement of parts which establishes the stance of man is an active state and thus tiring (rather than being a relaxed state).  Hence, it would reveal in man an origin analogous to that of the other mammals, if his organic structure alone were taken into considerations.

Now, in order to follow, in all its points, the hypothesis presented from the start of these observations, it is appropriate to add the following considerations.

The individuals of the dominant race we are talking about spread out into all the habitable places suitable for them.  Having considerably multiplied their needs as the societies which they formed became more numerous they would have had to by the same process multiply their ideas and thus to have felt the need to communicate with those like them.  We may imagine that from this resulted the necessity for them to increase and to vary to the same extent the signs appropriate for the communication of these ideas.  Thus, it is evident that the individuals of this race would have had to make continual effort to create, multiply, and vary sufficiently the signs which their ideas and numerous needs rendered essential.

This is not the case with other animals.  For although the most perfect among them, like the quadrumanes, live for the most part in groups, since the remarkable supremacy of the race we are talking about, they have remained without progressing in the perfectioning of their faculties, having been chased away everywhere and relegated to wilderness areas, deserts usually limited in extent, where, unhappy and restless, they are forced continuously to flee and hide.  In this situation, these animals no longer form new needs, acquire new ideas.  Their ideas remain few and do not change.  And among these ideas there are very few which they would need to communicate to other individuals of the same species.  Thus, they need only very few different signs to make themselves understood to those like them. Hence,  some movements of the body or some of its parts, a few hissings and cries varied by simple vocal inflections are enough for them.

By contrast, the individuals of the dominant race already mentioned, having had a need to multiply the signs to communicate quickly their ideas (which have become more and more numerous), and not resting content with pantomime signs or the possible inflections of their voice, in order to represent this multitude of signs which has become necessary would have succeeded, by different efforts, in forming articulated sounds.  At first they would have used only a small number, combined with the inflections of their voice.  Afterwards, they would have increased them, varied them, and perfected them, according to the growth of their needs and to the extent that they would have made more effort to produce them.  In fact, the habitual exercise of the throat, tongue, and lips to articulate sounds would have really developed this faculty in them.

From that would come, for this particular race, the origin of the admirable capability of talking.  And since the distance between places where the individuals making up this race would have widened and encouraged the corruption of the signs agreed upon in order to convey each idea, from that would have originated languages, which have been diversified everywhere.

Thus, in this matter, needs alone would have achieved everything.  They would have given birth to efforts, and the organs appropriate to the articulation of sounds would have developed by their habitual use.

Such might be the reflections which one could make if man, considered here as the preeminent race in question, were not distinguished from animals except by the characteristics of his organic structure and if his origin were not different from theirs.

(2) In order to perfect the organs of movement for the animals, nature had to leave off the system of articulated limbs, which are not the result of a skeleton, in order to establish the system of four limbs dependent on an interior skeleton which is unique to the most perfect animals. This is what nature has carried out in the annelids and the mollusks, where she has set about preparing the methods to begin, in the fish, the organic structure specific to vertebrate animals. Thus, in the annelids, she has abandoned articulated limbs, and in the mollusks has done even more: she has ceased to use a longitudinal ganglionic chord. [Back to Text]
