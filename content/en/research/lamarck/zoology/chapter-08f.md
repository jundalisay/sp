ANNELIDS

(Eighth class of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous animals with an elongated body, which is soft and ringed laterally, rarely having eyes and a distinct head, and lacking articulated limbs. Arteries and veins for circulation; respiration by gills; a longitudinal ganglionic chord.

Observations

We see in the annelids that nature is forced to abandon the method of articulation which she has constantly used with the insects, arachnids, and crustaceans. Their bodies--elongated, soft, and for the most part composed of simple rings--gives these animals the appearance of being just as imperfect as the worms, with whom people have confused them. But since they have arteries and veins and breathe by gills, these animals, very distinct from the worms, must, along with the cirripeds, make the transition from the crustaceans to the mollusks.

They lack articulated limbs (2), and most of them have, on the side, bristles or bundles  which take the place of limbs. Almost all of them are suckers and feed themselves only on fluid material.

Cirripeds

(Ninth Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous and testaceous animals without a head and eyes, having a mantle which covers the inside of the shell, articulated arms with a horny skin, and two pairs of jaws in the mouth; respiration by gills; a longitudinal ganglionic chord; vessels for circulation.

Observations

Although we know only a small numbers of general which are linked to this class, the characteristics of the animals which make up these genera are so remarkable that it is necessary that we distinguish them as making up a specific class.

The cirripeds have a shell, a mantle, and have no head or eyes. Thus they cannot be crustaceans. Their articulated arms mean that we cannot place them among the annelids. And their longitudinal ganglionic chord prevents us from combining them with the mollusks.

Anatifa

Remarks: We see that the cirripeds still incline towards the annelids by their longitudinal ganglionic chord. But in these animals, nature is preparing itself to create the mollusks, because they already have, as do the latter, a mantle which covers the interior of their shell.

Mollusks

(Class Ten of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous animals, with a soft body (not articulated in its parts) and a variable mantle; respiration by very diversified gills; no spinal chord, no longitudinal ganglionic chord; nerves ending at an imperfect brain.

Most of them are enveloped in a shell; others have a shell more or less entirely enclosed in their interior; and still others have no shell at all.

Observations

The mollusks are the best organized of the animals without vertebrae, that is to say, those whose organic structure is is the most complex and which come closest to that of fish.

They make up a numerous class which ends the invertebrates and which is really distinguished from the other classes, since the animals which make it up have a nervous system, like many others, but are the only ones which have neither a longitudinal ganglionic chord nor a spinal chord.

Nature, at the point of starting to form the system of organic structure of the vertebrate animals, appears here to be preparing herself for this change. Thus the mollusks, which have no link any more to the style of articulation and of the attachment which a horny skin gives for the muscles of animals who have this feature, are very slow in the movements and appear, in this respect, more imperfectly structured than even the insects.

Finally, since the mollusks make the transition from invertebrates to vertebrate animals, their nervous system is intermediate, and displays neither the longitudinal ganglionic chord of the invertebrate animals with nerves nor the spinal chord of the vertebrate animals. This is eminently characteristic of them and clearly distinguishes them from the other invertebrates.
