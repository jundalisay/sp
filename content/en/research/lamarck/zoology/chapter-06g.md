## INSECTS

These are animals undergoing transformations of form with 2 eyes and 2 antennae on the head, 6 limbs, and 2 trachea extending throughout the entire body.

As we continue to follow the inverse order to nature's, after the arachnids necessarily come the insects, that is, this immense series of imperfect animals which have neither arteries, nor veins, which breathe by air trachea which are not limited, and finally which, being born in a state less perfect than that in which they reproduce, consequently undergo metamorphosis.

Once they reach their perfect condition, all the insects, without exception, have 6 articulated limbs, 2 antennae and 2 eyes on the head, and most of them then have wings.

According to the order we are following, the insects of necessity take up the tenth rank in the animal kingdom. 

For they are inferior in improvements to their organic structure to the arachnids, because they are not, like the latter, born in their perfect condition and they reproduce only once during the course of their lives.

Particularly among the insects we begin to notice that the organs essential to maintain life are distributed almost equally and most of them are situated throughout the extent of the body, rather than being isolated in particular places, as was the case in the most improved animals. 

This consideration gradually loses its exceptions and becomes more and more striking in the animals in the later classes.

Nowhere, up to this point, is the general degradation in organic structure more manifest than in the insects, where that structure is inferior in improvements to that of the animals in all the preceding classes. 

This degradation even shows up between the different orders which naturally divide the insects. For those in the three first orders (Coleoptera, Orthoptera, and Neuroptera) have mandibles and jaws in their mouths. 

Those of the fourth order (Hymenoptera) begin to possess a sort of proboscis; finally those of the four last orders (Lepidopteres, Hemiptera, Diptera and Aptera) really have only a proboscis. 

Paired jaws do not turn up anywhere in the animal kingdom after the insects of the three first orders. With respect to wings, the insects of the six first orders have four of them, of which all or two alone serve for flight. Those of the seventh and eighth orders have only two wings, or their wings are aborted. The larvae of insects of the two final orders do have limbs and resemble worms.

It appears that insects are the last animals which display a clearly distinct sexual reproduction and which are truly oviparous.

Finally, we will see that the insects are infinitely remarkable for the details concerning what has been called their industry but that this alleged industry is not at all the product of any thinking, that is, of any combination of ideas on their part.


### Observation

Just as the fish, among the vertebrates, display in their general shape and in the anomalies relative to the progression in complexity of organic structure, the results of the influence of their environmental habitat, so the insects, among the invertebrates, display in their form, organic structure, and transformations, the clear result of the influence of the open air in which they live and up into which most of them leap and habitually stay, like the birds.

If the insects had had a lung, if they had been capable of inflating themselves with air, and if the air which reaches all parts of their body had been able to rarefy itself there, like the air which goes into the bodies of birds, their hairs would have been changed, no doubt, into feathers.

Finally, if, among the invertebrate animals, it is astonishing to find so few affinities between the insects which undergo singular metamorphoses and the invertebrate animals of the other classes, one should draw attention to the fact that these are the only animals without vertebrae who leap up into the air and carry out progressive movements there. Then one will sense that quite special circumstances and habits must have produced results which are just as special.

The insects are close only to the arachnids in their interrelationships. And, in fact, both of them are, in general, the only animals without vertebrae which live in the air. But no spider has the ability to fly, and no arachnid likewise undergoes transformation. In dealing with influences of habits, I will show that these animals, because they were accustomed to stay on parts of the surface of the earth and to live in hidden places, must have lost some of the ability of insects and to acquire characteristics which clearly distinguish them from insects.


The Destruction of Several Organs Essential to the More Improved Animals
After the insects, it appears that there is quite a considerable gap in the series, which animals we have not observed remain to fill in. For in this position in the series, several organs essential to more improved animals suddenly are missing and are really done away with, because we do not find them again in the classes which remain for us to review.


The Disappearance of the Nervous System
Here the nervous system (the nerves and their central connection) effectively disappears completely and does not appear any more in any of the animals of the classes which follow.

In the most improved animals, this system consists of a brain which appears to serve to carry out of acts of intelligence, at the base of which is located the chamber of sensations, from which the nerves leave, as well as a dorsal spinal chord which sends other nerves out to the various parts.

In the vertebrates, the brain successively diminishes, and as its volume gets smaller, the spinal column becomes larger and seems to take its place.

In the mollusks, the first class of invertebrates, the brain still exists, but it does not have a spinal chord or longitudinal marrow with ganglia. Since the ganglia are rare, the nerves do not appear knotty.

Finally, in the five classes which follow, the nervous system, in its last stage, is reduced to a very small brain, hardly a trace, and a longitudinal marrow which sends nerves to the parts. From that point on there is no isolated chamber for sensations, but a multitude of small places spread throughout the full length of the animal.

Thus, in the insects the important system of feeling ends, that system which, at a particular stage of its development, gives rise to ideas, which in its highest perfection can produce all intelligent acts, and which, finally, is the source where muscular action gets its power and without which sexual reproduction apparently cannot exist.


### Disappearance of the Sexual Organs

Again, here traces of sexual reproduction disappear completely and, in fact, in the animals which are going to be listed, it is no longer possible to recognize the organs of a true fertilization. Nevertheless, we are going to find again in the animals of the two classes which follow, species with types of ovaries in oviform corpuscles which are taken for eggs. But I consider these alleged eggs, which can produce without prior fertilization as buds or internal gemmules. They create the link between internal gemmiparous reproduction and oviparous sexual reproduction.

The inclination of human beings for their own habits is so great that they persist, even against the evidence, to look at things always in the same manner.

This is the reason why botanists, accustomed to observe the sexual organs of a large number of plants, want all plants, without exception, to have similar organs. Consequently, several of them have made every imaginable effort, with respect to the plants cryptogames or agames, to discover stamens and pistils. And they have preferred to attribute to the plants arbitrarily and without proof functions to those parts whose use they did not know rather than to recognize that nature knows how to reach the same goal by different means.

We were persuaded that every reproductive body is a seed or an egg, that is, a body which, in order to be reproductive, needs to undergo the influence of sexual fertilization. This point made Linnaeus state: Omne vivum ex ovo [All living things are from the egg]. But we now know very well plants and animals which regenerate themselves solely by bodies which are neither seed nor eggs and which, consequently, have no need for sexual fertilization. Thus, these bodies are shaped differently and develop in a different manner.

Here is the principle to which we must pay attention in order to assess the method of reproduction of any living body whatever.

Every reproductive corpuscle, whether plant or animal, which, without breaking through any enclosing material, grows longer and larger and become a plant or animal similar to the one which it came from is neither a seed nor an egg. It does not undergo any fertilization or hatch after having started to grow, and its formation has not required any sexual impregnation. Thus it does not contain an embryo enclosed in layers which must be broken through, as in the seed or the egg.

Now, follow attentively the developments of the reproductive corpuscles of algae, fungi, and so on, and you will see that these corpuscles only grow longer and larger so as to take on imperceptibly the form of the plant from which they issued forth. They do no break through any enclosing material, as does the embryo of the seed or the one that contains the egg.

Similarly, if you follow the gemma or bud of a polyp, like the hydra, you will be convinced that this reproductive body only grows longer and larger, that it does not break through any exterior covering, in a word, that it does not hatch like a chicken or a silk worm coming from an egg.

Thus, it is clear that all reproduction of individuals does not take place by way of sexual fertilization and that where sexual fertilization does not bring it about, there is essentially no true sexual organ. Now, since, after the insects, we do not distinguish in the four classes of animals which follow any organ of fertilization, it appears that it is at this point in the animal chain that sexual reproduction ceases to exist.


Disappearance of the Organ for Sight
Here again, the organ for sight, so useful to the most perfect animals, is entirely done away with. This organ, which started to be absent in a section of the mollusks, in the cirrhipedes, and in most of the annelids, and which is found again in the crustaceans, arachnids, and insects only in a very imperfect condition, with an extremely limited use (or none at all) does not reappear after the insects in any animal.

Finally, at this point also the head, that essential body part in the most perfect animals, the seat of the brain and almost all the senses, totally ceases to exist. For the bulge in the forward extremity of the body of some worms, like the Taenia, which is caused by the arrangement of their suckers, is neither the seat of a brain nor of organs of hearing, sight, and so on, because all these organs are lacking in the animals of the classes which follow; the swelling in question cannot be considered a true head.

We see that at this stage of the animal scale, the degradation in organic structure becomes extremely rapid and that it makes one look ahead to the greatest simplification in the organic structure of animals.


## WORMS

Animals with soft, long bodies, without a head, eyes, articulated limbs, lacking a longitudinal marrow and a system of circulation.

We are here considering the worms, who do not have any vessels for circulation, for instance, those which we know about under the name intestinal worms, and some other non-intestinal worms, whose organic structure is just as imperfect. These are animals with a soft body, more or less elongated, not undergoing any metamorphosis, and all lacking head, eyes, and articulated limbs.

The worms must immediately follow the insects, come before the radiates, and occupy the eleventh rank in the animal kingdom. Among them we see starting nature's tendency to establish the system of articulations, a system which she has later completely developed in the insects, arachnids, and crustaceans. But the organic structure of worms is less perfect than that of insects, because they no longer have a longitudinal marrow, head, eyes, and real limbs. Thus, this organic structure compels us to put them after the insects. Finally, the new style in the shape which nature starts in them to establish a system of articulations and to move away from the radiating system in the parts proves that we must place the worms before the radiates themselves. In addition, after the insects we lose the plan carried out by nature in the preceding classes, that is, this general animal shape which consists of an opposing symmetry in the parts, in such a way that each of the parts is opposite an entirely similar part.

In the worms, we no longer find this opposing symmetry in the parts, and we do not see again the radiating arrangement of the organs, both interior and exterior, which we notice in the radiates.

Since the time that I established the class of annelids, some naturalists have given the name worms to annelids themselves. Since they then did not know what to do about the animals in question, they combined them with the polyps. I leave it to the reader to judge what affinities and classic characteristics authorize us to combine in the same class a Tenia or an Ascaris with a Hydra or any other polyp.

Like the insects, several worms appear still to breathe by trachea, whose openings to the outside are s type of stigmata. But there is reason to believe that these limited and imperfect trachea are aquatic and not aerial, like those of insects, because these animals never live in the open air and are always either deep in water or bathed in the fluids which contain them.

No organ of fertilization is very distinct in them. Thus, I assume that sexual reproduction has no role with this animal. Nevertheless, it could be possible that, just as the circulation is hinted at in the arachnids, so sexual reproduction is sketched out in the worms. This seems to be indicated by the different shapes of the tail in the Strongylus. But observation has not yet well established this reproduction in these animals.

What we see in some of the worms and what we take to be ovaries (as in the Tenia) appear to be only a mass of reproductive corpuscles which do not require fertilization. These oviform corpuscles are internal, like those in the sea urchin, instead of being external like those in the Coryne, and so on. The polyps display amongst themselves the same differences with respect to the position of the gemmules which they produce. Thus, it is plausible that the worms are internally gemmiparous.

Some animals which, like the worms, lack head, eyes, limbs and perhaps sexual reproduction, thus also establish, in their turn, the degradation maintained in the organic structure which we are looking into in the entire extent of the animal scale.
