I have divided into 6 very distinct stages all the styles of organic structure in the animal ladder.

Of these 6 stages, the 4 first ones include the animals without vertebrae.

<!-- Hence, the first 10 classes of the animal kingdom, according to the new order which we are going to follow; the two last stages include all the vertebrate animals, and thus the four (or five) final classes of animals. -->

This will make it easier to follow the march of nature in her production of animals.

<!-- , to distinguish, throughout the whole extent of the animal ladder, the progress attained in the complexity of organic structure, and to verify throughout the precision of the distribution or the appropriateness of the assigned ranks, by examining the known characteristics and facts of organic structure. -->


This is the way in which for several years in my lessons at the Museum I set out the invertebrates, always proceeding from the most simple towards the most complex.

<!-- In order to make the arrangement and the totality of the general series of animals more distinct, let us first present  -->


 <!-- limiting ourselves to a very simple exposition of their characteristics and the stages of organic structure which they include. -->


Stage | Description
--- | ---
1 | No nerves, no vessels, no special internal organs other than for digestion
2 | No knotty (ganglionic) longitudinal chord; no vessels for circulation; few interior organs other than those for digestion
3 | Nerves ending in a knotty (ganglionic) longitudinal chord; respiration by aerated gills; circulation is absent or imperfect
4 | Nerves ending either in a brain or in a longitudinal ganglionic chord; respiration by gills; arteries and veins for circulation
5 | Nerves ending at a brain which does not fill the skull cavity; heart with one ventricle; cold blood
6 | Nerves ending in a brain which fills the cranial cavity; heart with two ventricles; warm blood


Here is a table of the 14 classes dividing the animal kingdom.


## Table of the Distribution and Classification of Animals

### Invertebrates 

Stage | Class | Name  
--- | --- | ---
1 | 1 | Infusorians
1 | 2 | Polyps
2 | 3 | Radiates
2 | 4 | Worms
3 | 5 | Insects
3 | 6 | Arachnids
4 | 7 | Crustaceans
4 | 8 | Annelids
4 | 9 | Cirripeds
4 | 10 | Mollusks


### Vertebrates

Stage | Class | Name  
--- | --- | ---
5 | 11 | Fish
5 | 12 | Reptiles
5 | 13 | Birds
6 | 14 | Mammals


Such is the table of the 14 classes for the known animals.
- It is arranged following the order which matches the order of nature. 

<!-- The arrangement of these classes is such that that  -->

We will always be forced to conform to this arrangement even if we refuse to adopt the lines of separation which form them.

This arrangement is based on the analysis of the organic structure of living bodies. 

Of first importance is:
- the affinities which exist among the objects in each division
- the rank of each of these groups

People will never find solid reasons for changing this distribution in its entirety.

But we will be able to make changes in:
- the details
- the divisions subordinate to the classes

This is because the affinities between objects comprising the sub-divisions are more difficult to determine and assume a more arbitrary character.

This arrangement and distribution of animals conform to the very order of nature.

I am going to reveal the general series of known animals, divided into its principal divisions, proceeding from the simplest towards the most complex, in accordance with the reasons indicated above.

<!-- My purpose, in this exposition, will be to put the reader in a position to -->

This will make us recognize the rank, in the general series, of animals.

 <!-- which, in the course of this work, I have often had occasion to refer to and to spare the reader the trouble of having to go to other works of zoology for that information. -->

However, I will give here only a simple list of genera and only of the principal divisions; but this list will be sufficient to demonstrate the extent of the general series, its arrangement conforming the most with the order of nature, and the indispensable placement of classes, orders, and thus, perhaps, of families and genera. We understand well that it is in the good works of zoology which we possess that we must study the details of all the objects mentioned in this list, because I have not taken that into consideration in this work.











<!-- 1 Amorphous animals reproducing by fission or budding; gelatinous bodies, transparent, homogeneous, contractile and microscopic; no rayed tentacles or rotary limbs; no special organ, not even for digestion.

II POLYPS
Budding, gelatinous regenerating bodies, without any internal organ other than an alimentary canal with only one opening.  Terminal mouth, surrounded by radiating tentacles or furnished with ciliated and radiating organs. The majority form compound animals.
-->


<!-- III RADIATES
Free suboviparous, with a regenerating body, lacking a head, eyes, articulated limbs, and having in its parts a radiating arrangement, a mouth underneath.

IV WORMS
Suboviparous, with a soft regenerating body, not undergoing any metamorphosis, and never having eyes, nor articulated limbs nor a radiating arrangement in its interior parts.
-->

<!-- V INSECTS
Oviparous, undergoing metamorphoses and having, in the perfect state, eyes in the head, six articulated limbs, and tracheae which extend throughout; a single fertilization during a lifetime.

VI ARACHNIDS
Oviparous, with always articulated limbs and eyes in the head, not undergoing any metamorphosis; limited tracheae for respiration; rudimentary circulation; several fertilizations during a lifetime. -->

<!-- VII CRUSTACEANS
Oviparous, having articulated bodies and limbs; crustaceous skin, eye in the head, and most frequently four antennae; respiration by gills; a knotty (ganglionic) longitudinal chord.

VIII ANNELIDS
Oviparous, with elongated and annulated body; no articulated limbs; rarely eyes; respiration by gills; a knotty (ganglionic) longitudinal chord.

IX CIRRIPEDS
Oviparous, having an articulated mantle and limbs whose skin is horny, no eyes; respiration by gills, a knotty (ganglionic) longitudinal chord.

X MOLLUSKS
Oviparous, soft body, no articulation in its limbs. with a variable mantle; respiration by gills diversified in their form and their situation; no spinal chord, no knotty (ganglionic) longitudinal chord, but nerves ending in a brain.


XI FISH
Oviparous and without teats; complete and constant respiration by gills; outline of two or four limbs; fins for movement; no hair or feathers on the skin.

XII REPTILES
Oviparous and without teats; incomplete respiration, most often by lungs which exist all the time or in later age; four limbs, or two, or none; no hair or feathers on the skin.

XIII BIRDS
Oviparous and without teats; four articulated limbs, of which two are shaped into wings; respiration entirely by adhering pierced lungs; feathers on the skin.

XIV MAMMALS
Viviparous and with teats; four articulated limbs or only two; respiration entirely by lungs not pierced through to the exterior; hair on some parts of the body. -->
