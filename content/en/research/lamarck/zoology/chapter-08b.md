Such is the table of the 14 classes established among the known animals, and arranged following the order which most closely approximates the order of nature. 

The arrangement of these classes is such that that we will always be forced to conform to it, even if we refuse to adopt the lines of separation which form them, because this arrangement is based on the analysis of the organic structure of the living bodies with which it deals. 

This consideration, of the first importance, establishes the affinities which exist among the objects making up each division and the rank of each one of these groups in the entire series.

People will never find solid reasons for changing this distribution in its entirety, for reasons which I am going to reveal. But we will be able to make changes in the details, and above all in the divisions subordinate to the classes, because the affinities between objects comprising the sub-divisions are more difficult to determine and assume a more arbitrary character.

This arrangement and distribution of animals conform to the very order of nature.

I am going to reveal the general series of known animals, divided into its principal divisions, proceeding from the simplest towards the most complex, in accordance with the reasons indicated above.

My purpose, in this exposition, will be to put the reader in a position to recognize the rank, in the general series, occupied by the animals which, in the course of this work, I have often had occasion to refer to and to spare the reader the trouble of having to go to other works of zoology for that information.

However, I will give here only a simple list of genera and only of the principal divisions; but this list will be sufficient to demonstrate the extent of the general series, its arrangement conforming the most with the order of nature, and the indispensable placement of classes, orders, and thus, perhaps, of families and genera. We understand well that it is in the good works of zoology which we possess that we must study the details of all the objects mentioned in this list, because I have not taken that into consideration in this work.


## General Distribution of Animals

Invertebrate Animals

They do not have any vertebral column and consequently have no skeleton; those which have points of support for the movement of parts have them under their teguments. They lack a spinal chord and present a great diversity in the complexity of their organic structure.

First Stage of Organic Structure

No nerves, no longitudinal ganglionic chord, no vessels for circulation, no respiratory organs; no other special interior organ except for digestion.

[The Infusorians and Polyps]

THE INFUSORIANS
(First Class of the animal kingdom)

Fissiparous animals, amorphous, with gelatinous bodies, transparent, homogeneous, contractile and microscopic; no radiating tentacles; no rotary appendages; no special organ in the interior, not even for digestion.

Observations

Of all the known animals, the infusorians are the most imperfect, the simplest in organic structure, and those which possess the fewest capacities. It is certain they have no ability to feel.

Infinitely small, gelatinous, transparent, contractile, almost homogeneous, and incapable of having any special organ because of the excessively weak consistency of their parts, the infusorians are really only the rudiments of animal life.

These frail animals are the only ones which do not carry out digestion in order to nourish themselves and which, in fact, feed only by absorption through the pores of their skin and by an interior saturation.

In this matter they resemble the plants, which live only by absorption and carry out no digestion and whose organic movements operate only through external stimuli. But the infusorians are irritable and contractile, and they go through sudden movements which they can repeat several times in a row, something which characterizes their nature as animals and fundamentally distinguishes them from plants.

Table of Infusorians

First Order: Naked Infusorians

They lack external appendages

Monads
Volvox
Proteus
Vibrio

------
Bursaria
Colpoda

Second Order: Infusorians with Appendages

They have projecting parts, like hairs, types of horns or a tail

Cercaria
Trichocerca
Trichoda

Remarks. The monad, and especially the one which is called Monas termo, is the most imperfect and simplest of known animals, because its body, which is extremely small, displays only a gelatinous and transparent point, but it is contractile. This animal therefore must be considered the one at which the series of animals, organized according to nature, begins.

POLYPS
(Second Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Gemmiparous animals, with gelatinous regenerating bodies, without any interior organ except an alimentary canal with a single opening.  Terminal mouth surrounded by radiating tentacles or furnished with ciliated or rotatory organs.  The majority adhere to each other, communicate together by their alimentary canal, and thus form composite animals.

Observations

We saw in the infusorians infinitely small, frail animalcules without consistency, without a shape unique to their class, without any organs at all, and consequently without a mouth and a distinct alimentary canal.

In the polyps, the simplicity and imperfection of the organic structure, although still very noticeable, are less great than in the infusorians. Organic structure has clearly made some progress, for already nature has given the animals of this class a consistently regular form; already they are furnished with a special organ for digestion, and consequently with a mouth, the entry to their alimentary sack.

If we picture for ourselves a small elongated body, gelatinous, very irritable, having at its upper extremity a mouth furnished either with rotatory organs or radiating tentacles which serves as the entry point to an alimentary canal which has no other opening, we will get an image of the polyp.

If we add to this idea the notion of the adherence of several of these small bodies, living together and participating in a common life, we will understand the most general and the most remarkable fact concerning these animals.

Since the polyps have neither nerves for feeling nor special organs for respiration nor vessels for the circulation of their fluids, they are the more imperfect in their organic structure than the animals which are going to follow.

Second Stage of Organic Structure

No longitudinal ganglionic chord, no vessels for circulation; a few special internal organs (either tubes or pores taking in water or species of ovaries) other than those for digestion.

[The Radiates and Worms]

RADIATES

(Third Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Subgemmiparous animals, free or wandering; with regenerating bodies, a radiating arrangement of parts, both internal and external, and compound organ of digestion; lower mouth, simple or multiple.  No head, no eyes, no articulated limbs; a few internal organs other than those for digestion.

Observations

Here is the third line of classic separation which it is useful to draw in the natural distribution of animals.

Here we find entirely new forms which all nonetheless have affinities with a common similar type, as follows: the radiating arrangement of the parts, both interior and exterior.

These are no long animals with an elongated body, an upper terminal mouth, usually established in a polypary with a great number of them living together, each participating in a communal life. These are animals with a more complex organic structure than in the polyps, simple, always free, with a design which is unique to them, and generally orienting themselves in an inverted position.

Almost all the radiata have tubes drawing in water which appear to be aquatic trachaea. And in a great number we find special bodies which look like ovaries.

In a Memorandum which I have just heard read in the assembly of professors at the Museum, I learn than a wise observer, Doctor Spix, a Bavarian physician, has discovered in the star fishes and sea anemones the apparatus of a nervous system.

Doctor Spix claims to have observed that in the red star-fish, under a membrane made up of tendons (like a tent) there is suspended on the stomach a reticular structure made up of whitish nodules and threads and, in addition, at the origin of each ray, two nodules or ganglia which communicate with each other by a thread and from which other threads leave and go to parts close by; among others there are two very long threads which run through the full length of the ray and supply the tentacles.

According to the observations of this learned man, we see in each ray two nodules, a small extension of the stomach (coecum), two hepatic lobes, two ovaries and trachaeal canals.

In the sea-anemones, Dr. Spix observed at the base of these animals, below the stomach, a few pairs of nodules, arranged around a centre, which communicate with each other by cylindrical threads and which send out other threads to the upper parts. Moreover, he saw there four ovaries surrounding the stomach, from the base of which canals leave which, after joining up, open into a lower point of the alimentary canal.

It is astonishing that such a complex organic apparatus has escaped the attention of all those who have examined the organic structure of these animals.

If Doctor Spix was not imagining things in in what he believed he saw and if he was not wrong in attributing to these organisms a nature and functions different from what is appropriate to them (something which has happened to so many botanists who believed they saw male and female organs in almost all the cryptogram plants), then the consequences are as follows:

(1) It is not in the insects that we must establish the commencement of a nervous system;

(2) This system must be considered as rudimentary in the insects, radiates, and even in the sea-anemone, the last genre of polyps;

(3) This is not a reason why all polyps should possess the rudiments of this system, in the same way that it does not follow that all reptiles are equipped with bills just because some have them.

(4) Finally, the nervous system is no less a special organ, not shared by all living bodies. For not only is it irrelevant in plants but it it is not even present in all the animals. As I have made known, it is impossible that the infusorians are furnished with a nervous system and assuredly polyps in general are not capable of having one. Thus, we would look for it in vain in the hydras, which nonetheless belong to the last order of polyps, the one closest to the radiates, since it includes the sea anemones.

Thus, whatever the basis for the facts cited above, the points which I present in this work on the successive formation of the different special organs remain valid no matter at what point in the animal scale each of these organs originates. And it is always the case that the abilities which the organs provide for the animal do not begin to operate until the organ which provides them come into existence.
