In order to give the idea of species has some real foundation, let us look at following points:

1. All organic bodies of our earth are true products of nature, which she has brought forth successively over a long period of time;

2. In her progress, nature began, and begins again every day, by creating the simplest organic bodies

She does not directly create anything except by this process of first beginnings of organic structure.
- These are spontaneous generation.

3. The first beginnings of animals and plants were formed in appropriate places and circumstances. 

Once the faculties of a commencing life and of organic movement were established, these animals and plants of necessity gradually developed organs.

In time, they diversified these organs, as well as their parts.

4. The faculty of growth in each portion of an organic body is inherent in the first effects of life

It gave rise to different ways of multiplication and reproduction of individuals. 

In this process, the progress acquired in the composition of the organic structure and in the shape and diversity of parts was maintained.

5. In time, through favourable circumstances, new habits modified the organs of a body.

 <!-- of changes which every point on the surface of the earth has successively undergone, in a word, with the assistance of the power which new situations and habits have for  endowed with life, all those which exist now have been imperceptibly shaped just as we see them. -->

6. After a sequence of events, living bodies experience changes in their organic structure 

What we call species have been created in this way imperceptibly and successively.

They have a constancy which is only relative to their condition and cannot be as old as nature.

A long time and an infinite variation in circumstances, nature has gradually formed the animals we know.

Some think that the diversity in the instincts of these animals debunks this theory.

 <!-- and by the consideration of the marvels in every genus which their various sorts of work offer? -->

<!-- Dare one carry the systematic spirit so far as to say that it is nature alone which has created this astonishing diversity of means, tricks, dexterity, precaution, and patience, so often illustrated to us by the industry of animals? 

Is not what we observe in this respect in the class of insects alone a thousand times more than sufficient to make us feel that limiting the power of nature would not permit her to produce on her own so many marvels and to impress on us the most persistent belief that here the will of the supreme Author of everything was necessary and alone sufficed to bring into existence so many admirable things? -->

<!-- Without doubt, one would have to be foolhardy or rather entirely idiotic to claim to assign limits to the power of the first Author of everything. But, by that alone, no one can dare to say that this infinite power could not have willed what nature herself shows us it has willed. -->

Nature herself brings about all these wonders.

She has created organic structures, life, even feeling.

she has multiplied and diversified within unknown limits the organs and faculties of organic bodies that she supports

she has created in animals, by the sole route of needs, which establish and direct habits, the source of all actions, all faculties, from the simplest right up to those which make up instinct, work, 

this power of nature is in the order of existing things

It shows the will of her divine Author

 <!-- who has been able to will that she has this ability? -->

Will I admire less the grandeur of the power of this first cause of everything if it has pleased Him that things were like this, that if, by so many acts of His will, this power was occupied and still is continually occupied with the details of all the particular things of creation, all the variations, all the developments and improvements, all the destruction and all the renewals, in a word, of all the transformations which universally happen in existing things?

I will prove that nature can produce by herself what we admire in her.

However, another objection is that everything which we see announces an unalterable constancy in the conservation of form in living things. 

All the animals that we have known in the past 3,000 years:
- have always been the same
- have lost nothing
- have acquired nothing in the improvement of their organs and in the shape of their parts.

To prove this apparent stability over a long time as a verified fact, the Report On the Collections of Natural History Brought Back from Egypt by M. Geoffroy writes:

<!-- Those writing the report express themselves on this point in the following way: -->

{{< r a="Geoffroy" >}}
<!-- First, the collection has this remarkable quality, that we can say it contains animals of all centuries.  -->

People have wanted to know if species change their form through time. 
<!-- We have never been in a better position to make a decision about a large number of remarkable species and for several thousands of others.  -->
The superstition of the ancient Egyptians was inspired by nature, with a view to leaving a monument of her history.

<!-- "It is not possible to control one's imaginative excitement when one sees still preserved with the smallest bones, the smallest hairs, and perfectly recognizable, such an animal which had, 3,000 years ago, priests or altars in Thebes or Memphis.  -->

As a result of this part of Geoffroy's collection, these animals are perfectly similar to today's." 

Annales du Mus√©um d'Hist. natur., vol. I, p. 235, and 236.

I do not deny the conformity in the appearance of these animals with individuals of the same species alive today. 

Thus, the birds which the Egyptians adored and embalmed 3,000 years ago are still totally similar to those alive today in Egypt.

This is because the past situation of Egypt and its climate are still similar to today.

<!-- Now, the birds which live there at present are still in the same circumstances where they were then and could not have been forced to change their habits.

Moreover, who does not sense that birds, which can so easily move on and choose places agreeable to them, are less subject to variation in local circumstances than many other animals and thus less challenged in their habits. -->

<!-- In fact, there is nothing in the observation mentioned above which contradicts the ideas I have revealed in this matter and, above all, which proves that the animals under discussion have existed for all time in nature. It proves only that they were present in Egypt two or three thousand years ago. And anyone in the habit of thinking about things, while at the same time observing what nature shows us of the monuments to its own antiquity, easily appreciates the value of a duration of two or three thousand years in comparison with that antiquity. -->

This apparent stability of things in nature will always be taken by common opinion as the truth of things, because, in general, people do not judge anything except in relation to themselves.

The man who judges only according to changes which he perceives himself, the intervals between these mutations are conditions of stability which appear unlimited to him, because of the brevity of the lifetime of the individuals in his species. 

His observations and factual notes go back only a few thousand years which is long compared with him.
- But it is extremely small compared to great changes in the Earth.

 <!-- durations which have witnessed the occurrence of the great changes the surface of the earth has undergone, everything appears stable on the planet which he inhabits, and he is encouraged to dismiss the signs presented to him everywhere by the monuments piled up around him or buried in the soil under his feet as he walks. -->

Quantities of space and time are relative. 

<!-- If man really wishes to imagine this truth, then he will be reserved in his judgments about the stability which he attributes in nature to the state of things which he observes. See in my Recherches sur les corps vivans, l'appendice, p. 141. -->

In acknowledging the imperceptible changes in species and the modification which individuals undergo, to the extent that they are forced to vary their habits or to acquire new ones, we are not confined solely to a consideration of the very small extents of time which our observations can include to allow us to see these changes. 

<!-- For, in addition to this induction, a number of facts collected for many years now also illuminate the question which I am examining, in such a way that it does not remain uncertain. And I can say that nowadays our observational knowledge is too advanced for the answer we are looking for not to be obvious. -->

<!-- In addition the fact that we know about the influences and the results of heterogeneous reproduction, we certainly know nowadays that  -->
