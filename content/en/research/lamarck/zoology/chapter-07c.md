 <!-- relevant to consider in all this consists in -->
The true order of things involves recognizing the following:

1. All slightly remarkable changes later maintained in circumstances where each race of animals is located works to create in that race a real change in its needs.

2. All changes in animals' needs require of them alternative actions to satisfy the new needs and, consequently, alternative habits.

3. The efforts of the animal's interior feeling arises from the demands for new actions to satisfy every new need 

This leads to the more frequent use of some of its parts which then makes that part grow or develop.

<!--  requires from the animal experiencing that need either the 

  which previously it used less often 

(something which develops and ), or the use of new parts which the needs imperceptibly bring  -->

<!-- Thus, to reach an understanding of the true causes of so many diverse forms and so many different habits, examples of which the known animals manifest to us, we must take into account the fact that  -->

The infinitely diversified and slowly changing conditions experienced by animals creates new needs and necessarily changes in their habits through generations. 

<!-- of each race are successively located have led, in each of them, to  -->

<!-- Now, once this truth, which one cannot contest, is recognized, it will be easy to see how animals have been able to satisfy the new needs and to acquire new habits, if we give some attention to  -->

There are 2 laws of nature which observation has always confirmed.


## First Law

 <!-- which has not exceeded the limit of its development,  -->

In every developing animal, the more frequent and sustained use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops, enlarges, and empowers it proportional to the duration of this use.

The constant lack of use of such an organ imperceptibly weakens it, makes it deteriorate, progressively diminishes it faculties, and ends by making it disappear.


## Second Law

<!-- Everything which nature has made individuals acquire or lose through the influence of  -->

Conditions influence a race for a long time, making them acquire or lose traits.
<!-- things. -->

The increase of decrease of organs from the use or disuse of them is transferred to the offspring provided that the acquired changes are common to the two sexes or to those who have produced these new individuals.*

{{< n n="This is the oversoul of the species. This debunks Darwin's theory which cannot account for why sterile worker ants are sterile even if their parent are fertile" >}}

<!-- Consequently, through the influence of the predominant use of some organ or by the influence of the constant disuse of this organ, 

nature preserves by reproduction in the new individuals arising from them,  -->


<!-- These are the 2 constant truths which cannot be overlooked except by those who have never observed nor followed nature in her work or by those who have let themselves be led into the error which I am going to contest. -->

Naturalists noticed that the forms of animals' parts are always linked to their use of these parts.
- So they mistook that the forms and the condition of the parts had led to the usage. 

If this were true, then nature would have created for the animal parts as many forms as required by the diversity of circumstances they encounter.

If so, we would not have:
- race horses in the form of those in England.
- our large draught horses, so heavy and different from these race horses, for nature on her own did not produce anything like them. 
- basset hounds with crooked limbs, such swift-running greyhounds, water spaniels, and so on
- tailless hens, fantail pigeons, and so on

We would be able to cultivate wild plants as much as we liked in the rich fertile soil of our gardens, without fear of seeing them change through long cultivation.

<!-- There is the mistake.  -->

<!-- For it is easy to demonstrate through observation that, by  -->

**In reality, it is the needs and the use of the parts which have developed those parts.**

<!-- , factors which even produced the parts at a time when they did not exist and which, consequently, gave rise to the condition in which we see them in each animal. -->

<!-- In order for that not to be the case, it would have been necessary for
in which they have to live and that these forms, as well as the circumstances, never change. -->


That is certainly not the natural order which exists. 

<!-- In this matter, for a long time we have had a feeling for what is really the case, because we developed the following sentence, which has become proverbial and universally known:  -->

The proverb "habits form a second nature" supports the laws above.
- If habits and the nature of every animal could never change, the proverb would be false.

 <!-- would not have arisen, and would not have been able to be preserved in the event someone had proposed it. -->
