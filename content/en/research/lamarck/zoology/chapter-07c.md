Now, the true order of things relevant to consider in all this consists in recognizing the following:

1. All slightly remarkable changes later maintained in circumstances where each race of animals is located works to create in that race a real change in its needs.

2. All changes in animals' needs require of them alternative actions to satisfy the new needs and, consequently, alternative habits.

3. Since the satisfaction of every new need demands new actions, it requires from the animal experiencing that need either the more frequent use of some of its parts which previously it used less often (something which develops and makes that part grow), or the use of new parts which the needs imperceptibly bring forth in the animal by the efforts of its interior feeling. This I will establish very soon by known facts.


Thus, to reach an understanding of the true causes of so many diverse forms and so many different habits, examples of which the known animals manifest to us, we must take into account the fact that the infinitely diversified and slowly changing conditions in which the animals of each race are successively located have led, in each of them, to new needs and necessarily to changes in their habits. 

Now, once this truth, which one cannot contest, is recognized, it will be easy to see how animals have been able to satisfy the new needs and to acquire new habits, if we give some attention to 

There are 2 laws of nature which observation has always confirmed.


## First Law

 <!-- which has not exceeded the limit of its development,  -->

In every developing animal, the more frequent and sustained use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops, enlarges, and empowers it proportional to the duration of this use.

The constant lack of use of such an organ imperceptibly weakens it, makes it deteriorate, progressively diminishes it faculties, and ends by making it disappear.


## Second Law

<!-- Everything which nature has made individuals acquire or lose through the influence of  -->

Conditions influence a race for a long time, making them acquire or lose traits.
<!-- things. -->

The increase of decrease of organs from the use or disuse of them is transferred to the offspring provided that the acquired changes are common to the two sexes or to those who have produced these new individuals.

<!-- Consequently, through the influence of the predominant use of some organ or by the influence of the constant disuse of this organ, 

nature preserves by reproduction in the new individuals arising from them,  -->


<!-- These are the 2 constant truths which cannot be overlooked except by those who have never observed nor followed nature in her work or by those who have let themselves be led into the error which I am going to contest. -->

Naturalists noticed that the forms of animals' parts are always linked to their use of these parts.
- So they mistook that the forms and the condition of the parts had led to the usage. 

If this were true, then nature would have created for the animal parts as many forms as required by the diversity of circumstances they encounter.

If so, we would not have:
- race horses in the form of those in England.
- our large draught horses, so heavy and different from these race horses, for nature on her own did not produce anything like them. 
- basset hounds with crooked limbs, such swift-running greyhounds, water spaniels, and so on
- tailless hens, fantail pigeons, and so on

We would be able to cultivate wild plants as much as we liked in the rich fertile soil of our gardens, without fear of seeing them change through long cultivation.

<!-- There is the mistake.  -->

<!-- For it is easy to demonstrate through observation that, by  -->

**In reality, it is the needs and the use of the parts which have developed those parts.**

<!-- , factors which even produced the parts at a time when they did not exist and which, consequently, gave rise to the condition in which we see them in each animal. -->

<!-- In order for that not to be the case, it would have been necessary for
in which they have to live and that these forms, as well as the circumstances, never change. -->


That is certainly not the natural order which exists. 

In this matter, for a long time we have had a feeling for what is really the case, because we developed the following sentence, which has become proverbial and universally known: habits form a second nature.

If habits and the nature of every animal were incapable of ever changing, the proverb would be false, would not have arisen, and would not have been able to be preserved in the event someone had proposed it.

If one considers seriously everything which I have just revealed, one will sense that I grounded my views rationally when in my work entitled Research Into Living Bodies (p. 50), I laid down the following proposition:

"It is not the organs, that is, the nature and the form of the animal's body parts, which have given rise to its habits and special faculties, but, by contrast, its habits, manner of life, and circumstances of the individuals from which the animal comes to possess, over time, the form of its body, the number and condition of its organs, and finally the faculties which it enjoys."

Let people consider well this proposition and bring to it all the observations which nature and the state of things enable us to make all the time. Then its importance and reliability will become for us the most significant evidence.

Favourable times and circumstances are, as I have already said, the two main means employed by nature to bring into existence all her productions. We know that time has no limits for her and that, as a result, she always has time to spare.

As to the circumstances which she needed and which she still uses every day to vary everything which she continues to produce, we can say that circumstances are, in some way, for her inexhaustible.

The main circumstances arise from the influence of climates, various temperatures in the atmosphere and all the environmental surroundings, the variety of places and their exposure, habits, the most ordinary movements, the most frequent actions, finally the means of self-preservation, reproduction, and so on.

As a result of these various influences, the faculties expand and grow stronger through use. With new habits preserved over a long time they diversify. 

Imperceptibly the arrangement, consistency, in a word, the nature and the condition of the parts, as well as the organs, undergo the consequences of all these influences, preserving and propagating themselves in reproduction.

These truths, which are only the consequences of the two natural laws set forth above, are, in every case, amply confirmed by the facts. They indicate clearly the march of nature in the variety of her productions.

But instead of contenting ourselves with generalities which we could consider hypothetical, let us examine the facts directly. Let us consider in animals what is produced by the use or lack of use of their organs on these very organs, according to the habits which each race has been compelled to acquire.

The constant lack of exercise of an organ reduces its faculties then gradually shrinks it then makes it disappear or even destroys it, if this lack of use continues for a long time in a sequence of successive generations of animals of the same race.

Then I will reveal how, by contrast, the habit of exercising an organ, in every animal which has not reached the limit in the diminution of its faculties, not only improves this organ's faculties and makes it grow, but also makes it develop and acquire dimensions which imperceptibly change it, so that in time it makes it quite different from the same organ examined in another animal which exercises it much less.

The lack of use of an organ, once it has become constant because of the habits which one has taken up, gradually diminishes that organ and ends up by making it disappear and even destroying it.

Since such a claim cannot be accepted without demonstrations (and not by a simple declaration), let us try to set out evidence by citing the major known facts which constitute the basis for it.

The vertebrate animals, in all of whom the design of the organic structure is almost the same, although they manifest much diversity in their parts, have their jaws equipped with teeth. However, in those among them in which circumstances have developed the habit of swallowing the objects on which they feed without previously chewing them at all, we find that their teeth have not undergone any development. Thus, these teeth either have remained hidden between the bony layers of the jaws, without being capable of appearing on the outside, or have even been destroyed right down to their basic elements.

In the whale, which we thought entirely without teeth, M. Geoffroy has found them hidden in the jaws of the fetus of the animal. This professor has also located in birds the groove where the teeth must have been placed. But we do not see them there any more.

Even in the class of mammals, which includes the most perfect animals, mainly those in which the design of the organic structure of vertebrates has been effected most completely, not only does the whale have no more teeth to use, but we also find there in the same class the ant eater (Myrmecophaga) in which the habit of not chewing has been introduced and preserved for a long time in the species.

Having eyes in the head is characteristic of a large number of various animals and is an essential part of the design in the organic structure of vertebrates.

Nevertheless, the mole which, through its habits, makes very little use of sight, has only very small eyes, hardly apparent, because the animal makes use of this organ very rarely.

The aspalax of Olivier (Voyage in Egypt and in Persia, II, pl. 28, f. 2), which lives underground, like the mole, and which probably exposes itself to the light of day even less than that animal, has completely lost the use of sight. Moreover, it manifests no more than vestiges of the organ which is the seat of sight. In addition, these vestiges are completely hidden under the skin and under some other parts which cover them over and do not provide any more the least access to light.

The Proteus, an aquatic reptile related (by its affinities) to the salamanders and living in deep and dark cavities under the water, like the aspalax, has only vestiges of the organs of sight, vestiges which are covered and hidden in the same manner.

Here is a decisive consideration concerning the question which I am at present raising.

Light does not penetrate everywhere. Consequently, animals who habitually live in the the places where there is no light lack the opportunity to exercise the organ of sight, if nature has furnished them with one.  Now, the animals which are part of a structural design in which the eyes are necessarily a part must have had them in their origins.  However, since we find among these animals ones which are without the use of this organ and which have only hidden and covered vestiges of it, it becomes evident that the diminution and even the disappearance of the organ in question are the results, for this organ, of a constant lack of exercise.

What proves the point is the fact that the organ of the ear is never like this.  We always find it in those animals in which the nature of their organic structure requires that the ear be present.  Here is the reason.

The material of sound (1), which is set in motion by the shock or the vibration of bodies, transfers to the organ of hearing the impression which it has received, penetrates everywhere, and moves through every medium, even the masses of the densest bodies.  The result is that every animal which is part of an organic structural design in which the ear is an essential part always has the opportunity to exercise this organ in whatever place it dwells.  Thus, among the vertebrate animals we do not witness any which lack the organ of the ear, and after that point, when this same organ is lacking, we do not find it again later in any of the animals of the later classes.

Such is not the case with the organ of sight, for we see this organ disappear, reappear, and disappear once more, as a result of the possibility or the impossibility of the animal's making use of it.

In the acephalid mollusks, the great development of the mantle has made their eyes and even their head entirely useless.  Although these organs are part of a structural plan which should include them, they have therefore had to disappear and die out through a constant lack of use.

Finally, part of the organic structural design of reptiles, as in other vertebrate animals, includes having four limbs dependent on their skeleton.  Consequently, snakes should have four of them, especially since they do not make up the last order of reptiles and since they are more distant from the fish than are the batrachians (frogs, salamanders, and so on).

However, snakes took up the habit of crawling on the ground and hiding in the grass.  Thus, their body, as a result of constant and repeated efforts to extend itself, so as to pass into narrow spaces, acquired a considerable length, totally disproportionate to its size.  Now, limbs would have been really useless to these animals and consequently remained unused (for extended limbs would have been an impediment to their need to crawl, and very short limbs, necessarily four in number, would have been incapable of moving their bodies).  Thus the lack of use of these parts, remaining constant for the races of this animal, made these very parts disappear entirely, although the limbs were actually in the design of the organic structure of animals of their class.

Many insects which, according to the natural characteristics of their order and even their genus, should have wings, lack them more less completely, because they do not use them.  A number of coleoptera, orthopetera, hymenoptera, and hemiptera, and so on give us examples of this fact.  The habits of these animals never put them in situations where they used their wings.

But it is not sufficient to provide an explanation for the cause which has led to the state of the organs of different animals, a condition which we observe is always the same in those of the same species.  

In addition, it is necessary to make known the alterations brought about in the organs of a single individual during its lifetime, solely as the product of a great mutation in the habits unique to the individuals of its species.  

<!-- The following extremely remarkable fact will complete the proof of the influence of habits on the condition of the organs and establish how much sustained changes in the habits of an individual lead to changes in the condition of the organs which are brought into action during the exercise of these habits.  has made known to the Class of Sciences, that he -->

Mr. Tenon of the Institute examined the intestinal canal of several men who had been passionate drinkers for most of their lives.

He constantly found the organ shortened by an extraordinary amount compared with non drinkers.

Those addicted to drinking eat very little solid food.

The drink which they consume in abundance is frequently sufficient to nourish them.

The spirit drinks do not stay long in the stomach or the intestine.

Such drinkers would have their stomach and the rest of the intestinal canal lose the habit of being distended, just as the stomachs of sedentary persons constantly busy with intellectual work who are accustomed to eating only a little gradually over time contract, and their intestines grow shorter.

This matter is not at all a question of a shrinking and a contraction brought about by a gathering in of the parts which would allow for an ordinary extension if these internal organs were filled, rather than undergoing a sustained emptiness.  

It is rather a question of a real and considerable shrinkage and contraction such that these organs would break rather than yield suddenly to causes which demand an ordinary extension.

Compare, at entirely similar ages, a man who, in order to free himself for studies and habitual intellectual work, has acquired the habit of eating very little with another who habitually takes plenty of exercise, frequently goes out of his house, and eats well.

The stomach of the first will have little capacity.
- It will be filled by a very small quantity of nourishment

The stomach of the second will have preserved and even increased its capacity.

There we have an organ strongly modified in its dimensions and capacity by the single cause of a change in habits over the lifetime of an individual.

The frequent use of an organ, once it becomes constant and habitually, increases the capacities of this organ, develops it, and makes it acquire dimensions and an active power which the organ does not possess in the animals which exercise it less.

It has just been shown that the lack of use of an organ which ought to exist modifies it, diminishes it, and ends up destroying it.

The continuous use of an organ, along with the efforts made to derive from it a substantial benefit in circumstances which demand it, fortifies the organ, extends and enlarges it, or makes new organs from it which can carry out functions which have become essential.

The bird drawn to water by the need to to find there prey which sustains its life extends the digits on its feet with  which it wishes to strike the water and move on the surface.

The skin which unites these digits at their base, because of these constantly repeated separations of the digits, acquires the habit of stretching itself.  

Thus, over time, the large membranes which link the digits of ducks, geese, and so on are formed just as we see them.  The same efforts made for swimming, that is, to push the water in order to advance and move in this liquid have in the same manner extended the membranes between the digits of frogs, sea-tortoises, otter, beaver, and so on.

By contrast, the bird whose way of living accustoms it to perching in trees and which descends from individuals which have all acquired this habit, necessarily has longer digits on its feet shaped in a different way from those of the aquatic animals which I have just cited.  

Its claws, over time, grow longer, sharper, and hook-like to grasp the branches on which the animal rests so often.

The shore bird which has no inclination to swim but needs to approach the water's edge to find its prey constantly runs the risk of sinking down in the mud.

This bird wishes that its body does not sink in liquid.

It makes every effort to extend and lengthen its feet.

This long habit which this bird and all those of its race acquire of extending and lengthening their feet brings it about that the individuals of this race find themselves elevated as if on stilts, having gradually developed long bare legs, that is, legs without feathers up to the thighs and often further than that.  

The same bird, wishing to fish without getting its body wet, is required to make continual efforts to lengthen its neck.  

The consequences of these habitual efforts in this individual and in those of its race must have, over time, lengthened their necks remarkably, a point which is, in fact, confirmed by the long neck of all shore birds.

If some swimming birds, like the swan and the goose, in which the legs are short, have nonetheless a very long neck, the reason is that these birds, while moving along on the water, are accustomed to plunge their heads down into it as deeply as they can to take from there the aquatic larvae and different animalcules on which they feed. They make no effort to lengthen their limbs.

If an animal, in order to satisfy its needs, makes repeated efforts to lengthen its tongue, that organ will acquire a considerable length (anteater, green woodpecker).  

If the animal needs to seize something with this same organ, then its tongue will divide and become forked.  The tongue of the humming birds, who seize things with their tongue, and that of lizards and snakes, who use their tongues to feel and recognize the bodies in front of them prove what I am proposing.
