A forceful and sustained change in the environment and in the habits and ways of life of animals creates a very remarkable change in the individuals exposed to it.

A bird which flies fast but is locked in a cage will lose most of its lightness and agility. 

Its body becomes more dense.
- its limbs lose power and suppleness
- its faculties are no longer the same. 

<!-- The animal which lives freely in the plains where it habitually runs quickly and the bird which meets its needs as it continually crosses huge expanses in the air, when caged up, one in the compartments of a menagerie or in our stables, the other in our cages or in our poultry yards, there undergo over time significant influences, especially after a sequence of reproductive cycles in a condition which makes them acquire new habits.

In the sixth chapter of this first part, I will have occasion to prove by well known facts the power of 


Changes in circumstances:
- give animals new needs
- lead to new actions

Repeated new actions bring about new habits and new tendencies.

The frequent use of an organ modifies that organ.

The same is true for plants.

<!-- In the case of plants, we will see the same thing concerning the effects of new circumstances on their manner of living and on the condition of their parts.  -->

The result is that we will no longer be astonished to see the considerable changes which we have made in those plants we have cultivated for a long time.

Thus, among living things, nature, offers us in an indisputable manner only individuals which succeed each other in sequence one after the other in reproduction and which come from each other. 

But species among them have only a relative constancy and are not invariable except temporarily.

Nevertheless, to facilitate our study and our knowledge of so many different bodies, it is useful to give the name species to the entire collection of similar individuals which reproduction perpetuates in the same condition, as long as their living circumstances do not change sufficiently to vary their habits, characteristics, and shape.


## Lost Species

There is still for me the issue of knowing if the means which nature adopted to assure the conservation of species or races has been so inadequate that entire races have now been wiped out or lost.

Fossils  remains which we find buried in the soil in so many different places present us with the remains of a multitude of various animals which have existed. Among them there are found only a very small number who, to our knowledge, have analogous creatures like them now alive.

From that, can we logically conclude that the species which we find in the fossil state and for which there is no living individual exactly similar known to us does not exist any more in nature? 

There are still so many portions of the earth's surface into which we have not gone, so many others which people capable of making observations have not crossed except casually, and still so many others, like the different parts of the sea bottom, where we have few means for identifying the animals which live there, that these different places could well conceal species unknown to us.

If there are some species truly lost, this can only be, without any doubt, among the large animals which live in the dry parts of the earth where man, through the absolute dominion which he exerts, has been able to succeed in destroying all the individuals of some species which he did not wish to preserve or to reduce to domesticity. Hence arises the possibility that the animals of Cuvier's genera palaeotherium, anoplotherium, megalonix, megatherium, mastodon and some other species of genera already known exist no longer in nature. However, that is only a possibility.

But the animals which live in the watery depths, above all in ocean waters, as well as all the small-bodied species living on the surface of the earth and breathing air are protected against the destruction of their species at the hand of man. Their reproductive rate is so large and the means which they have to save themselves from his pursuits or traps are such that there is no evidence that he can destroy the entire species of any of these animals.

Thus, it is only the large terrestrial animals which can be exposed to destruction of their species at the hand of man. Such an event could have taken place. 

But its reality has not yet been completely proved.

However, among the fossil remains which we find of so many animals who have existed there is a very large number belonging to animals for whom totally similar living analogues are unknown. And among these, most belong to the shelled mollusks, so that only the shells remain of these animals.

If a number of these fossil shells reveal differences which do not permit us, according to accepted opinions, to regard them as analogous to neighbouring species which we know about, surely it must follow that these shells belong to species truly lost? Why, moreover, would they be lost, since man could not have brought about their destruction? On the contrary, might it not be possible that the fossil individuals in question belong to species still existing but which have changed over time and have given way to species presently living which we find near by? The considerations which follow and our observations in the course of this work will make this assumption highly probable.

Every informed observer knows that nothing is constantly in the same state on the surface of the earth. In time, everything there undergoes various changes more or less constantly. High places are continuously eroded by the alternating actions of the sun, rain, and still other causes. Everything detached from there is drawn away toward places lower down. The beds of streams, rivers, even the seas vary in their shape, depth, and imperceptibly move. 

Everything on the earth's surface changes its position, shape, nature, and aspect.
<!-- , and even the climates of the earth's various regions are not any more stable. -->

The variations in the circumstances of living things, above all for animals, lead to changes in needs, habits, and ways of life.

If these changes give rise to modification of or developments in their organs and the shape of their parts, we must sense that imperceptibly all living bodies whatsoever must vary, especially in their shapes or external characteristics, although this variation will become noticeable only after a considerable time.

Thus, it is not astonishing if, among the numerous fossils which we find in all the dry places of the earth and which present to us so many animals which existed in previous times, there are found so few whose living analogues we recognize.

By contrast, if there is anything which should astonish us it is to encounter among these numerous fossil remains of bodies once living some still having living analogues we do know about. This fact, which our fossil collections confirm, should lead us to assume that the fossil remains of animals whose living analogues we know about are the least ancient fossils. The species to which each of them belongs has undoubtedly not yet had sufficient time to vary in some of its forms.

Naturalists who have not perceived the changes which most animals experience with the passage of time, wishing to explain the facts relevant to the observed fossils, as well as to the known revolutions in different places on the surface of the earth, have assumed that a universal catastrophe took place with respect to the terrestrial globe and destroyed a large number of the species then in existence.

It is a pity that this convenient method of dealing with one's embarrassment when one wants to explain the operations of nature whose causes one been unable to grasp has no foundation except in the imagination which created it. 

It cannot be supported with a single proof.

Local catastrophes, like those which produce earthquakes, volcanoes, and other particular causes are sufficiently well known, and it is possible to observe the disorder which they bring about in the places which have experienced them.

But why should anyone assume, without proof, a universal catastrophe, when the better known progress of nature is sufficient to provide a reason for all the facts which we observe in all its parts?

Nature works slowly and by successive degrees.

The particular or local causes of disorders, revolutions, displacements, and so on, can provide reasons for everything which we observe on the surface of the earth and are nonetheless subject to nature's laws and her general progress, one will recognize that it is not at all necessary to assume that a universal catastrophe came to knock over everything and destroy a large part of the very operations of nature.
