In my 'Research Into Living Bodies (p. 50)' I laid down the following proposition:

"It is not the organs, that is, the nature and the form of the animal's body parts, which cause habits and special faculties.

In contrast, its habits, manner of life, and circumstances of the individuals from which the animal comes to possess, over time, the form of its body, the number and condition of its organs, and finally the faculties which it enjoys."


<!-- Let people consider well this proposition and bring to it all the observations which nature and the state of things enable us to make all the time. Then its importance and reliability will become for us the most significant evidence. -->

Favourable times and circumstances are the 2 main means employed by nature to bring into existence all her productions. 

Time has no limits for her and that, as a result, she always has time to spare.

As to the circumstances which she needed and which she still uses every day to vary everything which she continues to produce, we can say that circumstances are, in some way, for her inexhaustible.

The main circumstances arise from the influence of climates, various temperatures in the atmosphere and all the environmental surroundings, the variety of places and their exposure, habits, the most ordinary movements, the most frequent actions, finally the means of self-preservation, reproduction, and so on.

As a result of these various influences, the faculties expand and grow stronger through use. With new habits preserved over a long time they diversify. 

Imperceptibly the arrangement, consistency, in a word, the nature and the condition of the parts, as well as the organs, undergo the consequences of all these influences, preserving and propagating themselves in reproduction.

These truths, which are only the consequences of the two natural laws set forth above, are, in every case, amply confirmed by the facts. They indicate clearly the march of nature in the variety of her productions.

But instead of contenting ourselves with generalities which we could consider hypothetical, let us examine the facts directly. Let us consider in animals what is produced by the use or lack of use of their organs on these very organs, according to the habits which each race has been compelled to acquire.

The constant lack of exercise of an organ reduces its faculties then gradually shrinks it then makes it disappear or even destroys it, if this lack of use continues for a long time in a sequence of successive generations of animals of the same race.

Then I will reveal how, by contrast, the habit of exercising an organ, in every animal which has not reached the limit in the diminution of its faculties, not only improves this organ's faculties and makes it grow, but also makes it develop and acquire dimensions which imperceptibly change it, so that in time it makes it quite different from the same organ examined in another animal which exercises it much less.

The lack of use of an organ, once it has become constant because of the habits which one has taken up, gradually diminishes that organ and ends up by making it disappear and even destroying it.

Since such a claim cannot be accepted without demonstrations (and not by a simple declaration), let us try to set out evidence by citing the major known facts which constitute the basis for it.

The vertebrate animals, in all of whom the design of the organic structure is almost the same, although they manifest much diversity in their parts, have their jaws equipped with teeth. However, in those among them in which circumstances have developed the habit of swallowing the objects on which they feed without previously chewing them at all, we find that their teeth have not undergone any development. Thus, these teeth either have remained hidden between the bony layers of the jaws, without being capable of appearing on the outside, or have even been destroyed right down to their basic elements.

In the whale, which we thought entirely without teeth, M. Geoffroy has found them hidden in the jaws of the fetus of the animal. This professor has also located in birds the groove where the teeth must have been placed. But we do not see them there any more.

Even in the class of mammals, which includes the most perfect animals, mainly those in which the design of the organic structure of vertebrates has been effected most completely, not only does the whale have no more teeth to use, but we also find there in the same class the ant eater (Myrmecophaga) in which the habit of not chewing has been introduced and preserved for a long time in the species.

Having eyes in the head is characteristic of a large number of various animals and is an essential part of the design in the organic structure of vertebrates.

Nevertheless, the mole which, through its habits, makes very little use of sight, has only very small eyes, hardly apparent, because the animal makes use of this organ very rarely.

The aspalax of Olivier (Voyage in Egypt and in Persia, II, pl. 28, f. 2), which lives underground, like the mole, and which probably exposes itself to the light of day even less than that animal, has completely lost the use of sight. Moreover, it manifests no more than vestiges of the organ which is the seat of sight. In addition, these vestiges are completely hidden under the skin and under some other parts which cover them over and do not provide any more the least access to light.

The Proteus, an aquatic reptile related (by its affinities) to the salamanders and living in deep and dark cavities under the water, like the aspalax, has only vestiges of the organs of sight, vestiges which are covered and hidden in the same manner.

Here is a decisive consideration concerning the question which I am at present raising.

Light does not penetrate everywhere. Consequently, animals who habitually live in the the places where there is no light lack the opportunity to exercise the organ of sight, if nature has furnished them with one.  Now, the animals which are part of a structural design in which the eyes are necessarily a part must have had them in their origins.  However, since we find among these animals ones which are without the use of this organ and which have only hidden and covered vestiges of it, it becomes evident that the diminution and even the disappearance of the organ in question are the results, for this organ, of a constant lack of exercise.

What proves the point is the fact that the organ of the ear is never like this.  We always find it in those animals in which the nature of their organic structure requires that the ear be present.  Here is the reason.

The material of sound (1), which is set in motion by the shock or the vibration of bodies, transfers to the organ of hearing the impression which it has received, penetrates everywhere, and moves through every medium, even the masses of the densest bodies.  The result is that every animal which is part of an organic structural design in which the ear is an essential part always has the opportunity to exercise this organ in whatever place it dwells.  Thus, among the vertebrate animals we do not witness any which lack the organ of the ear, and after that point, when this same organ is lacking, we do not find it again later in any of the animals of the later classes.

Such is not the case with the organ of sight, for we see this organ disappear, reappear, and disappear once more, as a result of the possibility or the impossibility of the animal's making use of it.

In the acephalid mollusks, the great development of the mantle has made their eyes and even their head entirely useless.  Although these organs are part of a structural plan which should include them, they have therefore had to disappear and die out through a constant lack of use.

Finally, part of the organic structural design of reptiles, as in other vertebrate animals, includes having four limbs dependent on their skeleton.  Consequently, snakes should have four of them, especially since they do not make up the last order of reptiles and since they are more distant from the fish than are the batrachians (frogs, salamanders, and so on).

However, snakes took up the habit of crawling on the ground and hiding in the grass.  Thus, their body, as a result of constant and repeated efforts to extend itself, so as to pass into narrow spaces, acquired a considerable length, totally disproportionate to its size.  Now, limbs would have been really useless to these animals and consequently remained unused (for extended limbs would have been an impediment to their need to crawl, and very short limbs, necessarily four in number, would have been incapable of moving their bodies).  Thus the lack of use of these parts, remaining constant for the races of this animal, made these very parts disappear entirely, although the limbs were actually in the design of the organic structure of animals of their class.

Many insects which, according to the natural characteristics of their order and even their genus, should have wings, lack them more less completely, because they do not use them.  A number of coleoptera, orthopetera, hymenoptera, and hemiptera, and so on give us examples of this fact.  The habits of these animals never put them in situations where they used their wings.

But it is not sufficient to provide an explanation for the cause which has led to the state of the organs of different animals, a condition which we observe is always the same in those of the same species.  

In addition, it is necessary to make known the alterations brought about in the organs of a single individual during its lifetime, solely as the product of a great mutation in the habits unique to the individuals of its species.  

<!-- The following extremely remarkable fact will complete the proof of the influence of habits on the condition of the organs and establish how much sustained changes in the habits of an individual lead to changes in the condition of the organs which are brought into action during the exercise of these habits.  has made known to the Class of Sciences, that he -->

Mr. Tenon of the Institute examined the intestinal canal of several men who had been passionate drinkers for most of their lives.

He constantly found the organ shortened by an extraordinary amount compared with non drinkers.

Those addicted to drinking eat very little solid food.

The drink which they consume in abundance is frequently sufficient to nourish them.

The spirit drinks do not stay long in the stomach or the intestine.

Such drinkers would have their stomach and the rest of the intestinal canal lose the habit of being distended, just as the stomachs of sedentary persons constantly busy with intellectual work who are accustomed to eating only a little gradually over time contract, and their intestines grow shorter.

This matter is not at all a question of a shrinking and a contraction brought about by a gathering in of the parts which would allow for an ordinary extension if these internal organs were filled, rather than undergoing a sustained emptiness.  

It is rather a question of a real and considerable shrinkage and contraction such that these organs would break rather than yield suddenly to causes which demand an ordinary extension.

Compare, at entirely similar ages, a man who, in order to free himself for studies and habitual intellectual work, has acquired the habit of eating very little with another who habitually takes plenty of exercise, frequently goes out of his house, and eats well.

The stomach of the first will have little capacity.
- It will be filled by a very small quantity of nourishment

The stomach of the second will have preserved and even increased its capacity.

There we have an organ strongly modified in its dimensions and capacity by the single cause of a change in habits over the lifetime of an individual.

The frequent use of an organ, once it becomes constant and habitually, increases the capacities of this organ, develops it, and makes it acquire dimensions and an active power which the organ does not possess in the animals which exercise it less.

It has just been shown that the lack of use of an organ which ought to exist modifies it, diminishes it, and ends up destroying it.

The continuous use of an organ, along with the efforts made to derive from it a substantial benefit in circumstances which demand it, fortifies the organ, extends and enlarges it, or makes new organs from it which can carry out functions which have become essential.

The bird drawn to water by the need to to find there prey which sustains its life extends the digits on its feet with  which it wishes to strike the water and move on the surface.

The skin which unites these digits at their base, because of these constantly repeated separations of the digits, acquires the habit of stretching itself.  

Thus, over time, the large membranes which link the digits of ducks, geese, and so on are formed just as we see them.  The same efforts made for swimming, that is, to push the water in order to advance and move in this liquid have in the same manner extended the membranes between the digits of frogs, sea-tortoises, otter, beaver, and so on.

By contrast, the bird whose way of living accustoms it to perching in trees and which descends from individuals which have all acquired this habit, necessarily has longer digits on its feet shaped in a different way from those of the aquatic animals which I have just cited.  

Its claws, over time, grow longer, sharper, and hook-like to grasp the branches on which the animal rests so often.

The shore bird which has no inclination to swim but needs to approach the water's edge to find its prey constantly runs the risk of sinking down in the mud.

This bird wishes that its body does not sink in liquid.

It makes every effort to extend and lengthen its feet.

This long habit which this bird and all those of its race acquire of extending and lengthening their feet brings it about that the individuals of this race find themselves elevated as if on stilts, having gradually developed long bare legs, that is, legs without feathers up to the thighs and often further than that.  

The same bird, wishing to fish without getting its body wet, is required to make continual efforts to lengthen its neck.  

The consequences of these habitual efforts in this individual and in those of its race must have, over time, lengthened their necks remarkably, a point which is, in fact, confirmed by the long neck of all shore birds.

If some swimming birds, like the swan and the goose, in which the legs are short, have nonetheless a very long neck, the reason is that these birds, while moving along on the water, are accustomed to plunge their heads down into it as deeply as they can to take from there the aquatic larvae and different animalcules on which they feed. They make no effort to lengthen their limbs.

If an animal, in order to satisfy its needs, makes repeated efforts to lengthen its tongue, that organ will acquire a considerable length (anteater, green woodpecker).  

If the animal needs to seize something with this same organ, then its tongue will divide and become forked.  The tongue of the humming birds, who seize things with their tongue, and that of lizards and snakes, who use their tongues to feel and recognize the bodies in front of them prove what I am proposing.



Needs, always induced by circumstances, and the later efforts maintained to satisfy those needs are not limited in the results of their modifications, that is, in increasing or diminishing the extent and the capacities of organs.  But they also succeed in removing these same organs, when certain of these needs are not essential.

The fish which customarily swim in large bodies of water have a need to see laterally.  They, in fact, have their eyes placed on the sides of their heads.

Their bodies, more or less flattened, depending on the species, have their edges perpendicular to the plane of the water, and their eyes are placed in such away that there is one eye on each flat side.

But those fish whose habits require them constantly to come close to the shore, particularly to shores slightly inclined or with a gentle slope, have been forced to swim on their flattened side, in order to be able to approach more closely the edges of the water.  

In this situation, receiving more light from above than below and having a special need to be always attentive to what is found above them, their need has induced one of their eyes to undergo a sort of displacement and to occupy the very remarkable position that we know about in soles, turbots, dabs, and so on (the Pleuronectes and Achirus).  

The location of these eyes is no longer symmetrical, because it results from an incomplete mutation.  Now, this mutation is completely realized in the skates, where the transverse flattening of the body is totally horizontal, as well as the head.  Thus, the eyes of rays, both placed on the upper surface, have become symmetrical again.

The snakes, which crawl on the surface of the earth, need mainly to see elevated objects which are above them.  This need must have influenced the placement of the organ of sight in these animals.  In fact, they have their eyes situated in the lateral and upper part of the head, in such a way that they can easily perceive what is above them or beside them.  

But they hardly see at all what is in front of them a very short distance away.  However, forced to make up for this defect of vision for understanding the bodies which are in front of their heads and which might injure them if they moved forward, they were not able to perceive these bodies except with their tongue, which they were obligated to extend with all their force.  

This habit not only helped to make this tongue thin, very long, and contractile, but also it has also forced the tongue to divide itself in the majority of species in order to feel several objects at once.  It even permitted them to form an opening on the edge of their muzzle, so that they could move the tongue through it without separating their jaws.

Nothing is more noteworthy than what is produced by the habits of the herbivorous mammals.

The quadrupeds in which circumstances and the needs created by these over a long period of time have developed (in it as well as in the individuals of the race) the custom of grazing on grass, moves only on the ground, and finds itself obliged to remain their on its four feet for most of its life, not generally carrying out much movement (or only moderate movement).  The large amount of time this sort of animal is required to use each day to fill itself up with a single form of nourishment to which it is accustomed brings it about that it exercises itself very little by moving around and that it uses its limbs only to hold it up on the earth, to move or to run, and it never makes use of its limbs to cling to and climb up trees.

From this habit of consuming, every day, huge volumes of material for nourishment, which distends the organs taking it in, and from the habit of only carrying out moderate movements the result is that the bodies of these animals have grown considerably thicker, have become heavy and huge, and have acquired a really large volume, as we see in elephants, rhinoceroses, oxen, buffaloes, horses, and so on.

The habit of staying upright on four feet for the greater part of the day in order to graze has given rise to a thick horn which envelops the digits of their feet.  And since these digits have rested without being exercised by any movement and since they have not served any other purpose than to hold the animals up (just like the rest of the foot)  most of these digits have shrunk, dwindled, and have finally disappeared.  Thus, in the pachyderms, some have on their feet five digits enveloped in horn and, consequently, their hoof is divided into five parts; others have only four and still others have only three.  But in the ruminants, which appear to be the oldest of the mammals limited to sustaining themselves only on land, there are no longer more than two digits on the feet, and in the solipeds there is only one (horses, donkeys).

However, among the herbivorous animals, and particularly among the ruminants, it happens that there are some which, due to circumstances in the desert countries which they inhabit, are ceaselessly in danger of being the prey of carnivorous animals and which can find safely only in sudden flight.  

Necessity has thus forced them to practice rapid running.  From the habit which they have acquired from that, their bodies have become more svelte and their limbs much more slender.  We see examples of them in antelopes, gazelles, and so on

In our climate, other dangers continually expose the red deer, roe deer, and fallow deer to the mortal peril of hunting by human beings and reduce the animals to the same need, force upon them similar habits, and have given rise to the same productions with respect to them.

Ruminant animals can make use of their feet only to hold themselves up.  Since they have little power in their jaws, which are exercised only by cutting and browsing on grass, they cannot fight each other except with blows of the head, aiming the crown of their heads against each other.

In their fits of anger (which are frequent, above all among the males), their inner feeling, in these efforts, very strongly direct the fluids towards this part of their heads and there create a secretion of horny material in some and in others a bony material mixed with horny material.  This gives rise to solid protuberances.  Hence, the origin of horns and antlers, with which the heads of the majority of these animals are armed.

In this matter of habits, it is remarkable to observe the result in the peculiar form and height of the giraffe (camelo-pardalis).  

We know that this animal, the largest of the mammals, lives in the interior of Africa and dwells in those places where the earth, almost always arid and without grass, requires the animal to browse on the foliage of trees and constantly to try hard to reach that foliage.  As a result of this habit, maintained for a long time in all the individuals of its race, the animal's front limbs have become longer than those at the back, and its neck has grown longer to such an extent that the giraffe, without rearing up on its hind legs, lifts its head and reaches up to six metres in height (close to twenty feet).

Among the birds, the ostriches, lacking the capacity to fly and elevated on very high limbs, probably owe their remarkable form to analogous circumstances.

The result of habits is just as noteworthy in the carnivorous mammals as it is in the herbivores.  But it manifests effects of a different sort.

In fact, among these mammals those who are accustomed, along with their race,  to climb, to scratch away in order to dig a hole in the ground, or to rip apart other animals which they attack and kill for prey have a need to use the digits on their feet.  Now, this custom has favored the separation of their digits and has formed the claws with which we see them equipped.

But among the carnivores, there are those which are obliged to run in order to catch their prey.  

Among these animals those in which need (and consequently custom) has made it necessary every day for them to rip with their claws and to push them deep into the body of another animal in order to hang on to it and finally to make an effort to tear out the part they have seized must have, through repeated efforts, acquired for these claws a size and curved shape which would have then made them  very awkward for walking or running on stony ground.  

In this case, what happened was that the animal was obliged to make other efforts to push back these excessively projecting curved claws which got in its way.  

From this gradually resulted the formation of these remarkable sheaths in which cats, tigers, lions, and so on withdraw their claws when they are of no use.

Thus, efforts made in any direction whatever, if maintained for a long time or habitually made by certain parts of a living body to satisfy needs demanded by nature or circumstances enlarge these parts and make them acquire dimensions and a shape which they would never have attained if these efforts had not become the habitual action of the animals which carried them out.  Observations undertaken on all the known animals provide examples of this everywhere.

Is it possible that there is a more striking one than the kangaroo?  This animal, which carries its little ones in the pouch which it has under its abdomen, has acquired the habit of holding itself upright, balanced only on its back feet and its tail, and it does not move except with the help of a series of leaps in which it maintains its upright posture so as not to upset its young.   From this come the following:

1. Its front limbs, of which it makes very little use and on which it leans only in the moment when it abandons its upright posture, have never undergone a development proportional to that of the other parts and have remained thin, very small, and almost without force.

2. The back limbs, almost constantly in action, whether to hold up all the body or to carry out its jumps, have, by contrast, undergone a considerable development and have become very large and very powerful.

3. Finally, the tail which we see here used a great deal to hold the animal up and for carrying out its principal movements has acquired at its base an extremely remarkable thickness and power.

These well known facts are surely very relevant to show what results from the habitual use among animals of an organ or any part whatever.  

When one observes in an animal, an organ noticeably developed, strong, and powerful, people maintain that habitual exercise has done nothing to bring that about, that its sustained lack of use would not take anything away, and that finally this organ has always been just as it is now ever since the creation of the species to which this animal belongs, I will enquire why our domestic ducks cannot fly any more like wild ducks.
