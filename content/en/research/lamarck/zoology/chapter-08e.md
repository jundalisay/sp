(Sixth Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous animals, always having articulated limbs and eyes in the head; they do not undergo a metamorphosis and never possess wings or elytra; stigmata and limited trachaea for respiration; a rudimentary circulation system; several fertilizations in a lifetime.

Observations

The arachnids, which in the order which we have established come after the insects, show clear progress in the perfecting of organic structure.

Sexual reproduction manifests itself with the arachnids, for the first time, with all its capabilities, since these animals couple and reproduce several times in their lives, 

In the insects, the sexual organs, like those of plants, can only carry out a single fertilization. 

The arachnids are the first animals in which the circulation system begins to become sketched out. 

Cuvier writes that they have a heart extending from which, on the sides, are two or three pairs of vessels.

The arachnids:
- live in the air, like those insects which have reached the perfect condition
- do not undergo any metamorphosis
- never have wings and elytra, something which is not the result of some abortion
- remain hidden or living by themselves, feeding on prey or by sucking blood.

In the arachnids, the method of respiration is still the same as in the insects.

But the method is on the point of changing. 

The trachaea of arachnids:
- are very limited (impoverished) 
- do not extend to all the parts of the body

Cuvier writes that these trachaea have been reduced to a few vesicles.

After the arachnids, this method of respiration does not occur again in any of the classes of animals which follow.

This class of animals needs to treated with care. Many of them are venemous, especially those which live in hot climates.

CRUSTACEANS

(Seventh Class of the Animal Kingdom)

Oviparous animals, having articulated bodies and limbs, a crustaceous skin, several pairs of jaws, eyes and antennae in the head; respiration by gills; a heart and vessels for circulation.

Observations

Some significant changes in the organic structure of the animals of this class indicate that in forming the crustaceans nature has succeeded in making considerable progress in the organic structure of animals.

First, the method of respiration is here entirely different from that used in the arachnids and insects. And this method, made up of organs called gills, is going to continue right up to the fish. Trachaea do not appear again, and the gills themselves will disappear when nature is able to create a cellular lung.

Then, the circulation (which in the arachnids consists of only a simple outline) is fully established in the crustaceans, where we see a heart and arteries for sending out blood to the different parts of the body and veins which bring this fluid back to the principal organ responsible for its motion.

We find again in the crustaceans the style of articulations which nature has universally used in the insects and the arachnids, to facilitate muscular movement with the help of indurations of the skin, but from this point on nature will abandon this method of setting up an organic structure which no longer will require it.

The majority of crustaceans live in water, either fresh or brackish or salt. Some nonetheless remain on the earth and breathe air with their gills. All of them feed only on animal material.
