These examples of perfection first established in parts of a classification and later destroyed by others and later reestablished by the necessity and the pressure of things are not uncommon in the natural sciences.

In fact, Linnaeus combined several plant genera which Tournefort had previously separated, as one sees in his general polygonum, mimosa, justicia, convallaria, and plenty of others. And now the botanists are reestablishing the genera which Linnaeus had destroyed.

Finally, last year (in my course for 1807), I established among the animals without vertebrae a new tenth class, the infusorians, because after a sufficient examination of the known characteristics of these imperfect animals, I was convinced that I had been wrong to include them among the polyps.

Thus, in continuing to collect the facts gained through observation and through the rapid progress in comparative anatomy, I instituted successively the different classes which now make up my distribution of the animals without vertebrae. These classes, ten in number, are arranged from the most complex to the simplest, as is the custom, as follows:


Classes of Animals Without Vertebrae

Mollusks
Cirrhipeds
Annelids
Crustaceans
Arachnids
Insects
Worms
Radiata
Polyps
Infusorians
I will reveal in dealing with each of these classes that they constitute the necessary divisions, because they are based on a consideration of the organic structure and that, although it may be or indeed must be the case that we find in the vicinity of the limits to the classes some races, in one way or another, half way or intermediate between two classes, these divisions offer everything which art can produce which is most helpful in this sort of endeavour. Thus, as long as our main concern is an interest in science, people will not be able to do without acknowledging them.

It will be noticed that, by adding to these ten classes which divide the animals without backbones the four classes recognized and fixed by Linnaeus among the animals with vertebrae, we will have for the classification of all known animals the fourteen following classes, which I am going once more to present in an order opposite to the natural order.

Vertebrate Animals

Mammals

Birds

Reptiles

Fish

Invertebrate Animals

Mollusks

Cirrhipeds

Annelids

Crustaceans

Arachnids

Insects

Worms

Radiata

Polyps

Infusorians

Such is the present state of the general distribution of animals, and such is the distribution of classes which have been established among them

It will be a matter now of examining a very important questions which appears never to have been explored or discussed. However, the solution to it is essential. Here it is.

Since all the classes which are part of the animal kingdom form necessarily a series of large groups according to the growing complexity or diminishing complexity in their organic structure, must we, in the arrangement of this series, proceed from the most complex to the simplest or from the simplest to the most complex?

We will try to give the solution to this question in Chapter VIII which brings this part of the book to a conclusion. But before that we must examine a very remarkable fact, most worthy of our attention, which can lead us to notice the march nature follows in giving its various productions the existence which they enjoy. I am going to talk about the remarkable degradation which is found in all organic structure, if one moves through the natural series of animals, beginning with the most perfect or the most complex and moving towards the simplest and the most imperfect.

Although this degradation is not nor can be finely demarcated, as I will reveal, it exists in the main groups so evidently and with a sustained consistency, even in the variations in the path, that it depends, no doubt, on some general law which it is important for us to discover and, consequently, to seek out.
