These examples of perfection first established in parts of a classification.

Later, they were destroyed by others.

Then they were reestablished by the necessity and the pressure of things in the natural sciences.

Linnaeus combined several plant genera which Tournefort had previously separated such as his general polygonum, mimosa, justicia, convallaria, etc.

Now, botanists are reestablishing the genera which Linnaeus had destroyed.

In 1807, I established among the animals without vertebrae a new 10th class, the infusorians because they are not part of the polyps.

<!-- Thus, in continuing to collect the facts gained through observation and through the rapid progress in comparative anatomy, 

I instituted successively the different classes which now make up my distribution of the animals without vertebrae. These classes, ten in number, are arranged from the most complex to the simplest, as is the custom, as follows: -->

This leads to 14 Classes.


## 10 Classes of Animals Without Vertebrae (Complex to Simple)

Mollusks
Cirrhipeds
Annelids
Crustaceans
Arachnids
Insects
Worms
Radiata
Polyps
Infusorians

<!-- These classes constitute the necessary divisions because they are based on a consideration of the organic structure -->

 <!-- these divisions offer everything which art can produce which is most helpful in this sort of endeavour.  -->

<!-- As long as our interest is in science, people must acknowledge them.

By adding to these 10 classes which divide the animals without backbones the 4 classes recognized and fixed by Linnaeus among the animals with vertebrae, we will have for the classification of all known animals the 14 following classes.

I am going to present them in an order opposite to the natural order. -->

## 4 Classes of Vertebrate Animals

Mammals
Birds
Reptiles
Fish


In the limits of the classes, there are some races that are half-way or intermediate between 2 classes.

Such is the present state of the general distribution of animals.

<!-- , and such is the distribution of classes which have been established among them -->

<!-- It will be a matter now of examining a very important questions which appears never to have been explored or discussed. However, the solution to it is essential. Here it is. -->

All the classes of the animal kingdom form necessarily a series of large groups according to the growing or declining complexity in their organic structure.

Should we go from simple to complex or from complex to simple?

Chapter 8 will answer this.

Nature marches in a certain direction.

 <!-- giving its various productions the existence which they enjoy. I am going to talk about the  -->

A remarkable degradation is found in all organic structure if one moves from the most complex to the simplest animals.

 <!-- through the natural series of animals, beginning with the most perfect or the most complex and moving towards the simplest and the most imperfect. -->

This degradation is not nor can be finely demarcated.

Yet it exists in the main groups so evidently and consistently.

Even in the variations in the path, it depends on some general law which we should discover.
