[The Insects and Arachnids]

## INSECTS

Oviparous animals, undergoing metamorphoses, able to have wings, and possessing, in the perfect state, six articulated limbs, two antennae, two faceted eyes, and a horny skin.  

Respiration by aerated trachaea which extend to all the parts; no system of circulation; two distinct sexes; one single reproductive act in a lifetime.


### Observations

This has extremely numerous animals and a very different order of things from the 4 preceding classes.

In the place of modulations in the progressive complexity of the organic structure in animals, once we arrive at the insects, in this matter we have made quite a considerable leap.



They have:
- true heads which are always distinct
- very remarkable eyes (although still very imperfect)
- articulated limbs arranged in 2 rows
- the symmetrical form of paired and opposing parts which nature will use from this point on right up to and including the most perfect animals.


In the interior, they have a complete but very imperfect nervous system of nerves which end a a longitudinal ganglionic chord.  

The area where the sensations meet appears very fractured.

The senses are few and very obscure.

They have a real muscular system and distinct sexes which, however, can provide only a single fertilization (as with the plants).

They do not have a circulatory system.

It is necessary to go higher in the animal chain to find this improvement in organic structure.

The property of all insects is having wings in their perfect state, so that those which lack them have been deprived only by an abortion which has become habitual and constant.


### Observations

The genera have been reduced to fewer.

Interest in studying the subject and the simplicity and the clarity of the method seemed to me to demand this reduction, which is not going to harm at all an understanding of the objects.  

To use all the particular details which one could seize upon in the characteristics of animals and plants in order to multiply genera to infinity is to clutter up and obscure science instead of serving it.  

It makes the study of science so complicated and difficult, that it would become impossible to practice it, except for those who wished to dedicate their entire lives to learning the immense nomenclature and the minute characteristics used to make distinctions among animals.



A. SUCKING INSECTS

Their mouths display a sucker furnished or lacking a sheath

First Order: Apterous Insects

A proboscis with two valves and articulated in three places, containing a sucking organ with two bristles  The wings have usually aborted in both sexes; legless larvae; immobile nymph in a cocoon.

Flea

Second Order: Dipterous Insects

A non-articulated proboscis, straight or with an elbow, sometimes retractile.  Two bare wings membranous and veined; two balancers; vermiform larvae, most often without feet

(B) BITING INSECTS

Fifth Order: Hymenopterous Insects

Mandibles and a three-sectioned sucker more or less extended, the base of which is enclosed in a short sheath.  Four bare wings (membranous, veined, unequal); in the female the anus is equipped with a sting or apparatus for boring; immobile nymph.
