When one speaks today of modern physics, the first thought is of atomic weapons. 

<!-- Everybody realizes the enormous influence of these weapons on the political structure of our present world
and is willing to admit that the influence of physics on the general situation is greater than it ever
has been before. But is the political aspect of modern physics really the most important one?
When the world has adjusted itself in its political structure to the new technical possibilities, what
then will remain of the influence of modern physics?
To answer these questions, one has to remember that every tool carries with it the spirit by
which it has been created. Since every nation and every political group has to be interested in
the new weapons in some way irrespective of the location and of the cultural tradition of this
group, the spirit of modern physics will penetrate into the minds of many people and will connect
itself in different ways with the other traditions. What will be the outcome of this impact of a
special branch of modern science on different powerful old traditions? In those parts of the world
in which modern science has been developed the primary interest has been directed for a long
time toward practical activity, industry and engineering combined with a rational analysis of the
outer and inner conditions for such activity. Such people will find it rather easy to cope with the
new ideas since they have had time for a slow and gradual adjustment to the modern scientific
methods of thinking. In other parts of the world these ideas would be confronted with the
religious and philosophical foundations of the native culture. Since it is true that the results of
modern physics do touch such fundamental concepts as reality, space and time, the confrontation
may lead to entirely new developments which cannot yet be foreseen. One characteristic feature of this meeting between modern science and the older methods of thinking will be its complete internationality. In this exchange of
thoughts the one side, the old tradition, will be different in the different parts of the world, but
the other side will be the same everywhere and therefore the results of this exchange will be
spread over all areas in which the discussions take place.
For such reasons it may not be an unimportant task to try to discuss these ideas of modern
physics in a not too technical language, to study their philosophical consequences, and to compare
them with some of the older traditions. -->

The best way to enter into the problems of modern physics may be by a historical description
of the development of quantum theory. It is true that quantum theory is only a small sector of
atomic physics and atomic physics again is only a very small sector of modern science. Still it is in
quantum theory that the most fundamental changes with respect to the concept of reality have
taken place, and in quantum theory in its final form the new ideas of atomic physics are concentrated and crystallized. The enormous and extremely complicated experimental equipment
needed for research in nuclear physics shows another very impressive aspect of this part of
modern science. But with regard to the experimental technique nuclear physics represents the
extreme extension of a method of research which has determined the growth of modern science
ever since Huyghens or Volta or Faraday. In a similar sense the discouraging mathematical
complication of some parts of quantum theory may be said to represent the extreme
consequence of the methods of Newton or Gauss or Maxwell. But the change in the concept of
reality manifesting itself in quantum theory is not simply a continuation of the past; it seems to
be a real break in the structure of modern science. Therefore, the first of the following chapters 
will be devoted to the study of the historical development of quantum theory.
