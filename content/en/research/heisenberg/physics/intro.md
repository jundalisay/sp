A winner of the Nobel Prize, Werner Heisenberg was born in 1901 in Wurzberg, Germany. He studied
physics at the University of Munich and for his Ph.D. wrote a dissertation on turbulence in fluid streams.
Interested in Niels Bohr's account of the planetary atom, Heisenberg studied under Max Born at the
University of Gottingen and then, in 1924, went to the Universitets Institut for Teoretisk Fysik in Copenhagen, where he studied under Bohr. In 1925 he published a paper, `About the Quantum-theoretical
Reinterpretation of Kinetic and Mechanical Relationships', in which he proposed a reinterpretation of the
basic concepts of mechanics, and this was followed by the publication of his indeterminacy principle in
1927. In that year he became professor at the University of Leipzig and held the post until 1941, when he
was appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. After the war he organized and
became director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics at Gottingen, later moving with
the institute, in 1958, to Munich. As a public figure, he actively promoted the peaceful use of atomic power
and, in 1957, led other German scientists in opposing a move to equip the West German army with nuclear
weapons. In 1970 he became Director Emeritus of the Max Planck Institute. Heisenberg was awarded the
Nobel Prize in 1932 and received numerous other honours. He died in 1976.

Introduction
True revolutions in science involve more than spectacular discoveries and rapid advances in
understanding. They also change the concepts on which the subject is based. Such a
fundamental transformation took place in physics during the first thirty years of this century,
culminating in what has been called the Golden Age of Physics. As a result the physicist's world
view has been radically and irreversibly altered.
The developments that triggered this monumental convulsion involved the formulation of two
dramatically new theories. The first was a theory of space, time and motion, called relativity. The
second was a theory of the nature of matter and of the forces that act upon it. The latter had its
origins in Max Planck's observation that electromagnetic radiation is emitted in discrete packets,
or quanta. In the 1920S this ‘quantum theory' was elaborated into a general quantum mechanics.
The author of this book played a leading role in the early formulation of quantum mechanics and
in the subsequent clarification of its revolutionary implications. Those readers who know anything
at all of quantum mechanics will know that the famous ‘uncertainty principle', a key component in
quantum physics, is named after Heisenberg.
Although a great deal has recently been written about the bizarre conceptual foundations of
quantum mechanics, special importance must be attached to these deliberations of one of the
principal architects of the theory. Right up to his death in 1976 Heisenberg retained a deep
interest in the nature of the quantum universe and the profound philosophical implications that
flow from it. The exposition that follows is a sweeping survey of these ideas, together with an
appraisal
viii
of the theory of relativity and some aspects of nuclear and particle physics. It is a model of
clarity and one of the most lucid accounts of the so-called Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics that has become the standard viewpoint.
The central theme of Heisenberg'
s exposition, which is based on his 1955—6 Gifford lectures at
the University of St Andrews, is that words and concepts familiar in daily life can lose their
meaning in the world of relativity and quantum physics. Thus questions about space and time, or
the qualities of material objects such as their positions, which seem entirely reasonable in
everyday discourse, cannot always be meaningfully answered. This in turn has profound
implications for the nature of reality and for our total world view.
In many ways the conceptual upheaval demanded by the theory of relativity is more easily
accommodated than that due to quantum mechanics. True, relativity contains some strange
ideas, such as time dilation and length contraction, curved space and black holes. It also asserts
that certain types of question, which sound perfectly reasonable and meaningful, have no
unambiguous answer. To ask, for example, at what time an event occurs, or whether two events
that are separated in space occur at the same moment, may not be answerable as the questions
stand because the theory tells us that there is no absolute universal time, nor is there a
universal concept of simultaneity. Such things are relative and have therefore to be referred to a
specific reference frame before the question has meaning. But although these ideas are strange
and unfamiliar, they are not obviously absurd. Nor do they present any real interpretational
problems. For this reason the theory of relativity, in both its special and its general forms, must be
considered uncontroversial.
Probably the deepest philosophical problem presented by the theory of relativity is the
possibility that the universe may have had its origin at a finite moment in the past and that this
origin represented the abrupt coming into being not only of matter and energy but of space and
time as well. Indeed, the central lesson of the theory of relativity is that space and time are not
merely the arena in which the drama of the universe is acted out but part of the cast. That is,
space-time is as much a part of the physical universe as matter; in fact, the two are
ix
intimately interwoven. As Heisenberg remarks, the idea that time does not stretch back for all
eternity but was created with the universe was anticipated in the fifth century by St Augustine.
There is thus a scientific counterpart to the creation ex nihilo of Christian tradition. But the
violence done to our concept of physical causation is pro-found, and it is only very recently,
within the context of modern quantum cosmology (developed after Heisenberg's death), that a
satisfactory picture of the origin of space-time has been forthcoming.
By contrast with the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics presents us with much greater
conceptual and philosophical problems, and it is these problems that Heisenberg addresses so
clearly. It should be stressed at the outset that most students learn quantum mechanics
prescriptively and apply it without ever having to become embroiled in philosophical issues. The
practical application of quantum mechanics is extraordinarily successful and has penetrated many
areas of modern science and technology. Nobody questions what the theory predicts, only what
it means.
At the heart of the quantum revolution is Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This tells us,
roughly speaking, that all physical quantities that can be observed are subject to unpredictable
fluctuations, so that their values are not precisely defined. Consider, for example, the position x
and the momentum p of a quantum particle such as an electron. The experimenter is free to
measure either of these quantities to arbitrary precision, but they cannot possess precise values
simultaneously. The spread, or uncertainty, in their values, denoted by Ax and Ap respectively,
are such that the product of the two AxLp, cannot be less than a certain constant number. Thus
more accuracy in position must be traded for less in momentum, and vice versa. The constant
that enters here (called Planck's constant after Max Planck) is numerically very small, so that
quantum effects are generally only important in the atomic domain. We do not notice them in
daily life.
It is essential to appreciate that this uncertainty is inherent in nature and not merely the result of
technological limitations in measurement. I t is not that the experimenter is merely too clumsy to
measure position and momentum simultaneously. The particle simply does not possess
simultaneously precise values of these two attributes. One is
x
used to uncertainty in many physical processes – for example, in the stock market or in
thermodynamics – but in these cases the uncertainty is due to missing information rather than to
any fundamental limitation in what may be known about these systems.
The uncertainty has deep implications. For example, it means that a quantum particle does not
move along a well-defined path through space. An electron may leave place A and arrive at place
B, but it is not possible to ascribe a precise trajectory linking the two. Thus the popular model of
the atom, with electrons circling the nucleus along distinct orbits, is badly misleading. Heisenberg
tells us that such a model can be useful in producing a certain picture in our minds, but it is a
picture that has only a vague attachment to reality.
The smearing of position and momentum leads to an inherent indeterminism in the behaviour
of quantum systems. Even the most complete information about a system (which may be as
simple as a single freely moving particle) is generally insufficient to enable a definite prediction to
be made about the behaviour of the system. So two systems initially identical may go on to do
different things. For example, the experimenter may fire an electron at a target and find that it
scatters to the left, then, on repeating the experiment under exactly the same conditions, find
that the next electron scatters to the right.
This unpredictability of quantum systems does not imply anarchy, however. Quantum
mechanics still enables the relative probabilities of the alternatives to be specified precisely. Thus
quantum mechanics is a statistical theory. It can make definite predictions about ensembles of
identical systems, but it can generally tell us nothing definite about an individual system. Where it 
differs from other statistical theories, such as statistical mechanics, weather forecasting or
economics, is that the chance element is inherent in the nature of the quantum system and not
merely imposed by our limited grasp of all the variables that affect the system.
This is no mere pedantic quibble. Einstein for one was so appalled by the idea that there is
inherent unpredictability in the physical world that he rejected it outright, with the famous retort,
‘God does not play dice with the universe.' He maintained that quantum mechanics,
xi
while possibly correct as far as it goes, is nevertheless incomplete; that there must exist a deeper
level of hidden dynamical variables that affect the system and bestow upon it merely an apparent
indeterminism and unpredictability. Thus Einstein hoped that beneath the chaos of the quantum
might lie hidden a scaled-down version of the well-behaved, familiar world of deterministic
dynamics.
Heisenberg and Niels Bohr strongly opposed Einstein's attempt to cling on to this classical
world view. The debate, which began in the early 193os, extended over many years, with
Einstein all the time refining and reformulating his objections. The most enduring of these was
proposed with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen in 1935 and is usually referred to as the EPR
paradox (though there is actually no real paradox). It concerns the properties of a system of two
particles that interact and then fly apart to great distance. According to quantum mechanics, the
system remains an indivisible whole in spite of the separation of the particles in space.
Measurements performed on the particles simultaneously are predicted to show correlations that
imply that each particle carries, in some sense that can be well defined mathematically, an
imprint of the activities of the other. This cooperation takes place in spite of the strictures of
Einstein'
s own special theory of relativity, which forbids any instantaneous physical communication
between the particles.
To Einstein the two-particle system demonstrated the incompleteness of quantum mechanics
because by performing measurements on the second particle alone (effectively using it as a
means of gaining information about the first by proxy) the experimenter may deduce either the
position or the momentum of the first particle at that moment, according to whim. But this
surely implies, argued Einstein, that both these quantities must be attributed an element of
reality at that moment, as either (but not both!) can be accessed by the experimenter using a
measurement that cannot possibly (because of the speed of light restriction) have any
disturbance on the particle of interest.
The EPR paradox goes to the heart of the different world views that classical and quantum
physics impose upon us. The classical world view, so passionately espoused by Einstein, accords
well with
xii
common sense by asserting the objective reality of the external world. It recognizes that our
observations inevitably intrude into and disturb that world but that this disturbance is merely
incidental and can be made arbitrarily small. In particular, the microworld of atoms and particles
is considered to differ in scale, but not in ontological status, from the macroworld of experience.
Thus an electron is a scaled-down version of an idealized billiard ball, sharing with the latter a
complete set of dynamical attributes, such as being somewhere (i.e. having a position), moving in
a certain way (i.e. having a momentum) and so on. In a classical world our observations do not
create reality: they uncover it. Thus atoms and particles continue to exist with well-defined
attributes even when we do not observe them.
By contrast, the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which Heisenberg here
expounds so lucidly, rejects the objective reality of the quantum microworld. It denies that, say,
an electron has a well-defined position and a well-defined momentum in the absence of an actual
observation of either its position or its momentum (and both cannot yield sharp values
simultaneously). Thus an electron or an atom cannot be regarded as a little thing in the same 
sense that a billiard ball is a thing. One cannot meaningfully talk about what an electron is doing
between observations because it is the observations alone that create the reality of the electron.
Thus a measurement of an electron's position creates an electron-with-a-position; a measurement of its momentum creates an electron-with-a-momentum. But neither entity can be
considered already to be in existence prior to the measurement being made.
What, then, is an electron, according to this point of view? It is not so much a physical thing as
an abstract encodement of a set of potentialities or possible outcomes of measurements. It is a
shorthand way of referring to a means of connecting different observations via the quantum
mechanical formalism. But the reality is in the observations, not in the electron.
The denial of the objective reality of the external world implied by the Copenhagen
interpretation is often couched in more cautious terms, but Heisenberg here provides some of the
bluntest affirmations of this position that I have seen. Thus: ‘In the experiments about
xiii
atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are just as real as any
phenomena in daily life. But the atoms or the elementary particles themselves are not as real; they
form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or facts.' Einstein's opinions
are labelled ‘dogmatic realism', a very natural attitude, according to Heisenberg. Indeed, the vast
majority of scientists subscribe to it. They believe that their investigations actually refer to
something real ‘out there' in the physical world and that the lawful physical universe is not just the
invention of scientists. The unexpected success of simple mathematical laws in physics bolsters
the belief that science is tapping into an already existing external reality. But, Heisenberg reminds
us, quantum mechanics is also founded on simple mathematical laws that are very successful in
explaining the physical world but still do not require that world to have independent existence in
the sense of dogmatic realism. So natural science is actually possible without the basis of dogmatic
realism.
We here reach the topic that forms the culmination of Heisenberg's thesis. How, he asks, can
we speak about atoms and the like if their existence is so shadowy? What meaning are to we
attach to words that refer to their qualities? Again and again he emphasizes that the facts on
which we build the world of experience all refer to macroscopic things – clicks of a geiger
counter, spots on a photographic plate and so on. These are all things that we can meaningfully
communicate to each other in plain language (to borrow Bohr's phrase). Without this already
existing backdrop of classical, common-sense, familiar `
things
'
 (the reality of which seems
assured) we can make no sense at all of the quantum microworld. For all our measurements and
observations of the microworld are made by reference to classical apparatus and involve noting
well-defined records, such as the position of a pointer on a meter, about which everybody can
agree and in connection with which no vagueness or conceptual ambiguity arises.
Heisenberg buttresses his argument here by appeal to Bohr's so-called principle of
complementarity. This principle recognizes the essential ambiguity inherent in quantum systems,
that the same system can display apparently contradictory properties. An electron can behave
both as a wave and as a particle, for example. Bohr asserts that
xiv
these are complementary, as opposed to contradictory, faces of a single reality. One experiment
may reveal the wave nature of the electron, another the particle nature. Both cannot be
manifested at once; it is up to the experimenter to decide which facet to expose by his choice of
experiment. Similarly, position and momentum are complementary qualities. The experimenter
must again decide which quality to observe.
The question `Is an electron a wave or a particle?' has the same status as the question `Is
Australia above or below Britain?
'
 The answer is `Neither and both.'
 The electron possesses both
wave-like and particle-like aspects, either of which can be manifested but neither of which has
any meaning in the absence of a specific experimental context. And so the language of quantum 
mechanics employs familiar words, such as wave, particle, position, etc., but their meanings are
severely circumscribed and often vague. Heisenberg warns us that: `When this vague and
unsystematic use of language leads us into difficulties, the physicist has to withdraw into the
mathematical scheme and its unambiguous correlation with experimental facts.'
This is really the bottom line of the argument, for quantum mechanics is, at its core, a
mathematical scheme that relates the results of observations in a statistical fashion. And that is
all. Any talk of what is `really' going on is just an attempt to infuse the quantum world with a
spurious concreteness for ease of imagination. In this connection Heisenberg examines the work
of Descartes and Kant in the light of modern physics and concludes that words and their
associated concepts do not have absolute and sharply defined meanings. They arise through our
experiences of the world, and we do not know in advance the limits of their applicability. We
cannot expect to uncover any fundamental truths about the world merely from the abstract
manipulation of words and concepts. For Heisenberg the fact that certain cherished words and
concepts simply cannot be transported into the relativity or quantum domains is not especially
philosophically objectionable.
Although most of the quantum debate has been conducted at the philosophical level, there
have been a number of crucial experiments that have a direct bearing on the subject. Perhaps
the most important

concerns the elevation of the EPR thought experiment into the realm of practical physics. In 1965
John Bell extended the EPR argument and proved that, roughly speaking, any theory based on
`objective reality', and for which faster-than-light signalling is forbidden, must satisfy certain
mathematical inequalities. Quantum mechanics should, according to the standard theory, fail to
satisfy them, so one is obliged to relinquish either objective reality (with Bohr and Heisenberg) or
the special theory of relativity. Few physicists are willing to follow the latter course. To test Bell's
inequalities, in the early 1980s experiments using pairs of photons from a common atomic source
were performed by Alain Aspect and his colleagues at the Institut d'Optique, near Paris. After
many careful trials the results were clear. Bell's inequalities were indeed violated, in conformity with
the predictions of quantum mechanics.
These results came after Heisenberg's death, but I had a chance to discuss them with many of
his former colleagues who, along with Bohr, had helped shape the Copenhagen interpretation in
the 193os. They were all fairly low-key about the Aspect experiment, which so beautifully
reinforced their position, saying that the results could not have been otherwise and were no
surprise.
In spite of this, the Copenhagen interpretation is not without its detractors. Many physicists
still feel uncomfortable about a theory in which the formalism must be augmented by certain
epistemological assumptions before it can be applied. The fact that the Copenhagen
interpretation is founded upon acceptance of the prior existence of the classical macroscopic
world appears circular and paradoxical, for the macroworld is composed of the quantum
microworld. Although quantum effects in meter pointers and photographic grains are negligibly
small, they are there in principle. Physicists would like to derive the classical world as some sort of
macroscopic limit of the quantum world, not assume it a priori.
The weakness of the Copenhagen interpretation is exposed when the question `What actually
happens inside a piece of measuring apparatus when a measurement of a quantum particle is
made?' is asked. The Copenhagen position is that one merely treats the apparatus classically; but
if instead it is treated (more realistically) as
xvi
a collection (albeit large) of quantum particles, then the result is deeply worrying. The same
vagueness and indeterminism that afflict the quantum particle now invade the entire system.
Instead of the apparatus concretizing a specific actuality from a range of potential possibilities,
the combined system of apparatus + particle adopts a state that still represents a range of
potential possibilities. To take a specific example, if the apparatus is set up to measure whether
an electron is in the right or left half of a box, and to display this by throwing a pointer either to
the right or left respectively, the end result of the exercise is to put the combined system into a
state in which neither outcome is selected. Instead the state is a superposition of two states, one
consisting of the electron and the pointer on the right, the other consisting of them on the left.
So long as these two alternatives are mutually exclusive there might be no insurmountable
problem, but in more general experiments there can also be interference between the
alternatives, so that no clear either/or dichotomy is offered. In short, no actual measurement can
then be said to have occurred.
Heisenberg pays scant attention to the voluminous work on the `measurement problem' by
John von Neumann and others. He falls back on the argument that, sooner or later, the quantum
effects (specifically the interference of possibilities) dissipate into the macroscopic environment.
This will satisfy most people, but not a modern breed of physicist known as the quantum
cosmologist. These theorists attempt to apply quantum mechanics to the universe as a whole in
an effort to unravel the mystery of its origin. If the entire universe is the quantum system of
interest, there clearly does not exist a wider macroscopic environment, or external measuring
apparatus, into which quantum fuzziness can fade away. Most quantum cosmologists reject the
Copenhagen interpretation, with its need for additional epistemological machinery, and prefer
instead to take the quantum formalism at face value. This means serenely accepting the full range
of quantum alternatives as actually existing realities. That is, in the above-mentioned
measurement experiment one would assert the existence of two universes, one with the electron
and pointer on the left, the other with them on the right. In general, a quantum
xvii
measurement involves postulating an infinity of coexisting parallel worlds, or realities. Again,
many of these developments have occurred since Heisenberg's death, though I suspect he would
not have thought much of them.
Other topics are addressed in this book, most notably some of the early advances in nuclear
and particle physics. Heinsenberg does not refer much to his own attempts at unifying particle
physics, but he does point out some of the severe difficulties encountered in applying quantum
mechanics to relativistic particles. Here again, events have overtaken the book. The dreaded
divergencies, or infinities, which he mentions are today routinely accommodated in most
applications without spoiling the predictive power of the theory. Moreover, they may well be
avoided altogether in certain modern unified theories, especially in the so-called superstring
theory. Also our theory of elementary particles is in incomparably better shape today than when
the book was written, and the modern theory of quarks and leptons would probably have met
with Heisenberg's approval. His discussion of God and morality is rather superficial and is included,
one suspects, largely to satisfy the requirements of the Gifford Lectures.
But these are minor quibbles about a book that so satisfactorily teases out the essence of the
conceptual revolution that is the New Physics. Heisenberg achieves this with no mathematics
and a mini-mum of technical detail. One certainly does not need to be a physicist to follow his
arguments and to appreciate the momentous nature of the paradigm shift that followed the
relativity and quantum revolutions. The enduring appeal of this book is that it carries the reader,
with remarkable clarity, from the esoteric world of atomic physics to the world of people, language
and the conception of our shared reality.

An Old and a New Tradition
When one speaks today of modern physics, the first thought is of atomic weapons. Everybody
realizes the enormous influence of these weapons on the political structure of our present world
and is willing to admit that the influence of physics on the general situation is greater than it ever
has been before. But is the political aspect of modern physics really the most important one?
When the world has adjusted itself in its political structure to the new technical possibilities, what
then will remain of the influence of modern physics?
To answer these questions, one has to remember that every tool carries with it the spirit by
which it has been created. Since every nation and every political group has to be interested in
the new weapons in some way irrespective of the location and of the cultural tradition of this
group, the spirit of modern physics will penetrate into the minds of many people and will connect
itself in different ways with the other traditions. What will be the outcome of this impact of a
special branch of modern science on different powerful old traditions? In those parts of the world
in which modern science has been developed the primary interest has been directed for a long
time toward practical activity, industry and engineering combined with a rational analysis of the
outer and inner conditions for such activity. Such people will find it rather easy to cope with the
new ideas since they have had time for a slow and gradual adjustment to the modern scientific
methods of thinking. In other parts of the world these ideas would be confronted with the
religious and philosophical foundations of the native culture. Since it is true that the results of
modern physics do touch such fundamental concepts as reality, space and time, the confrontation
may lead to entirely new developments
2
which cannot yet be foreseen. One characteristic feature of this meeting between modern science
and the older methods of thinking will be its complete internationality. In this exchange of
thoughts the one side, the old tradition, will be different in the different parts of the world, but
the other side will be the same everywhere and therefore the results of this exchange will be
spread over all areas in which the discussions take place.
For such reasons it may not be an unimportant task to try to discuss these ideas of modern
physics in a not too technical language, to study their philosophical consequences, and to compare
them with some of the older traditions.
The best way to enter into the problems of modern physics may be by a historical description
of the development of quantum theory. It is true that quantum theory is only a small sector of
atomic physics and atomic physics again is only a very small sector of modern science. Still it is in
quantum theory that the most fundamental changes with respect to the concept of reality have
taken place, and in quantum theory in its final form the new ideas of atomic physics are concentrated and crystallized. The enormous and extremely complicated experimental equipment
needed for research in nuclear physics shows another very impressive aspect of this part of
modern science. But with regard to the experimental technique nuclear physics represents the
extreme extension of a method of research which has determined the growth of modern science
ever since Huyghens or Volta or Faraday. In a similar sense the discouraging mathematical
complication of some parts of quantum theory may be said to represent the extreme
consequence of the methods of Newton or Gauss or Maxwell. But the change in the concept of
reality manifesting itself in quantum theory is not simply a continuation of the past; it seems to
be a real break in the structure of modern science. Therefore, the first of the following chapters 
will be devoted to the study of the historical development of quantum theory.

The History of Quantum Theory
The origin of quantum theory is connected with a well-known phenomenon, which did not belong
to the central parts of atomic physics. Any piece of matter when it is heated starts to glow, gets
red hot and white hot at higher temperatures. The color does not depend much on the surface of
the material, and for a black body it depends solely on the temperature. Therefore, the radiation
emitted by such a black body at high temperatures is a suitable object for physical research; it is
a simple phenomenon that should find a simple explanation in terms of the known laws for
radiation and heat. The attempt made at the end of the nineteenth century by Lord Rayleigh and
Jeans failed, however, and revealed serious difficulties. It would not be possible to describe these
difficulties here in simple terms. It must be sufficient to state that the application of the known
laws did not lead to sensible results. When Planck, in 1895, entered this line of research he tried to
turn the problem from radiation to the radiating atom. This turning did not remove any of the
difficulties inherent in the problem, but it simplified the interpretation of the empirical facts. It
was just at this time, during the summer of 1900, that Curlbaum and Rubens in Berlin had made
very accurate new measurements of the spectrum of heat radiation. When Planck heard of these
results he tried to represent them by simple mathematical formulas which looked plausible from
his research on the general connection between heat and radiation. One day Planck and Rubens
met for tea in Planck's home and compared Rubens' latest results with a new formula suggested
by Planck. The comparison showed a complete agreement. This was the discovery of Planck's law
of heat radiation.
It was at the same time the beginning of intense theoretical work
4
for Planck. What was the correct physical interpretation of the new formula? Since Planck could,
from his earlier work, translate his formula easily into a statement about the radiating atom (the
so-called oscillator), he must soon have found that his formula looked as if the oscillator could only
contain discrete quanta of energy – a result that was so different from anything known in
classical physics that he certainly must have refused to believe it in the beginning. But in a
period of most intensive work during the summer of 1900 he finally convinced himself that
there was no way of escaping from this conclusion. It was told by Planck's son that his father
spoke to him about his new ideas on a long walk through the Grunewald, the wood in the suburbs
of Berlin. On this walk he explained that he felt he had possibly made a discovery of the first
rank, comparable perhaps only to the discoveries of Newton. So Planck must have realized at this
time that his formula had touched the foundations of our description of nature, and that these
foundations would one day start to move from their traditional present location toward a new
and as yet unknown position of stability. Planck, who was conservative in his whole outlook, did
not like this consequence at all, but he published his quantum hypothesis in December of 1900.
The idea that energy could be emitted or absorbed only in discrete energy quanta was so new
that it could not be fitted into the traditional framework of physics. An attempt by Planck to 
reconcile his new hypothesis with the older laws of radiation failed in the essential points. It took
five years until the next step could be made in the new direction.
This time it was the young Albert Einstein, a revolutionary genius among the physicists, who
was not afraid to go further away from the old concepts. There were two problems in which he
could make use of the new ideas. One was the so-called photoelectric effect, the emission of
electrons from metals under the influence of light. The experiments, especially those of Lenard,
had shown that the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the light,
but only on its color or, more precisely, on its frequency. This could not be understood on the
basis of the traditional theory of radiation. Einstein could explain the observations by
interpreting Planck'
s
5
hypothesis as saying that light consists of quanta of energy traveling through space. The energy
of one light quantum should, in agreement with Planck's assumptions, be equal to the frequency
of the light multiplied by Planck'
s constant.
The other problem was the specific heat of solid bodies. The traditional theory led to values for
the specific heat which fitted the observations at higher temperatures but disagreed with them at
low ones. Again Einstein was able to show that one could understand this behavior by applying the
quantum hypothesis to the elastic vibrations of the atoms in the solid body. These two results
marked a very important advance, since they revealed the presence of Planck
'
s quantum of action
– as his constant is called among the physicists – in several phenomena, which had nothing
immediately to do with heat radiation. They revealed at the same time the deeply revolutionary
character of the new hypothesis, since the first of them led to a description of light completely
different from the traditional wave picture. Light could either be interpreted as consisting of
electromagnetic waves, according to Maxwell's theory, or as consisting of light quanta, energy
packets traveling through space with high velocity. But could it be both? Einstein knew, of
course, that the well-known phenomena of diffraction and interference can be explained only on
the basis of the wave picture. He was not able to dispute the complete contradiction between this
wave picture and the idea of the light quanta; nor did he even attempt to remove the
inconsistency of this interpretation. He simply took the contradiction as something which would
probably be understood only much later.
In the meantime the experiments of Becquerel, Curie and Rutherford had led to some
clarification concerning the structure of the atom. In 1911 Rutherford'
s observations on the
interaction of a-rays penetrating through matter resulted in his famous atomic model. The atom
is pictured as consisting of a nucleus, which is positively charged and contains nearly the total
mass of the atom, and electrons, which circle around the nucleus like the planets circle around
the sun. The chemical bond between atoms of different elements is explained as an interaction
between the outer electrons of the neighboring atoms; it has not directly to do with the atomic
nucleus. The nucleus determines
6
the chemical behavior of the atom through its charge which in turn fixes the number of electrons
in the neutral atom. Initially this model of the atom could not explain the most characteristic
feature of the atom, its enormous stability. No planetary system following the laws of Newton'
s
mechanics would ever go back to its original configuration after a collision with another such
system. But an atom of the element carbon, for instance, will still remain a carbon atom after any
collision or interaction in chemical binding.
The explanation for this unusual stability was given by Bohr in 1913, through the application of 
Planck's quantum hypothesis. If the atom can change its energy only by discrete energy quanta,
this must mean that the atom can exist only in discrete stationary states, the lowest of which is the
normal state of the atom. Therefore, after any kind of interaction the atom will finally always fall
back into its normal state.
By this application of quantum theory to the atomic model, Bohr could not only explain the
stability of the atom but also, in some simple cases, give a theoretical interpretation of the line
spectra emitted by the atoms after the excitation through electric discharge or heat. His theory
rested upon a combination of classical mechanics for the motion of the electrons with quantum
conditions, which were imposed upon the classical motions for defining the discrete stationary
states of the system. A consistent mathematical formulation for those conditions was later given
by Sommerfeld. Bohr was well aware of the fact that the quantum conditions spoil in some way
the consistency of Newtonian mechanics. In the simple case of the hydrogen atom one could
calculate from Bohr's theory the frequencies of the light emitted by the atom, and the agreement
with the observations was perfect. Yet these frequencies were different from the orbital frequencies and their harmonics of the electrons circling around the nucleus, and this fact showed
at once that the theory was still full of contradictions. But it contained an essential part of the
truth. It did explain qualitatively the chemical behavior of the atoms and their line spectra; the
existence of the discrete stationary states was verified by the experiments of Franck and Hertz,
Stern and Gerlach.
Bohr's theory had opened up a new line of research. The great amount of experimental
material collected by spectroscopy through
7
several decades was now available for information about the strange quantum laws governing
the motions of the electrons in the atom. The many experiments of chemistry could be used for
the same purpose. It was from this time on that the physicists learned to ask the right questions;
and asking the right question is frequently more than halfway to the solution of the problem.
What were these questions? Practically all of them had to do with the strange apparent
contradictions between the results of different experiments. How could it be that the same
radiation that produces interference patterns, and therefore must consist of waves, also produces the photoelectric effect, and therefore must consist of moving particles? How could it be
that the frequency of the orbital motion of the electron in the atom does not show up in the
frequency of the emitted radiation? Does this mean that there is no orbital motion? But if the
idea of orbital motion should in incorrect, what happens to the electrons inside the atom? One
can see the electrons move through a cloud chamber, and sometimes they are knocked out of an
atom; why should they not also move within the atom? It is true that they might be at rest in
the normal state of the atom, the state of lowest energy. But there are many states of higher
energy, where the electronic shell has an angular momentum. There the electrons cannot
possibly be at rest. One could add a number of similar examples. Again and again one found
that the attempt to describe atomic events in the traditional terms of physics led to
contradictions.
Gradually, during the early twenties, the physicists became accustomed to these difficulties,
they acquired a certain vague knowledge about where trouble would occur, and they learned to
avoid contradictions. They knew which description of an atomic event would be the correct one
for the special experiment under discussion. This was not sufficient to form a consistent general
picture of what happens in a quantum process, but it changed the minds of the physicists in
such a way that they somehow got into the spirit of quantum theory. Therefore, even some time
before one had a consistent formulation of quantum theory one knew more or less what would
be the result of any experiment.
One frequently discussed what one called ideal experiments. Such
8
experiments were designed to answer a very critical question irrespective of whether or not they
could actually be carried out. Of course it was important that it should be possible in principle to
carry out the experiment, but the technique might be extremely complicated. These ideal
experiments could be very useful in clarifying certain problems. If there was no agreement among
the physicists about the result of such an ideal experiment, it was frequently possible to find a
similar but simpler experiment that could be carried out, so that the experimental answer
contributed essentially to the clarification of quantum theory.
The strangest experience of those years was that the paradoxes of quantum theory did not
disappear during this process of clarification; on the contrary, they became even more marked
and more exciting. There was, for instance, the experiment of Compton on the scattering of Xrays. From earlier experiments on the interference of scattered light there could be no doubt that
scattering takes place essentially in the following way: The incident light wave makes an electron
in the beam vibrate in the frequency of the wave; the oscillating electron then emits a spherical
wave with the same frequency and thereby produces the scattered light. However, Compton
found in 1923 that the frequency of scattered X-rays was different from the frequency of the
incident X-ray. This change of frequency could be formally understood by assuming that
scattering is to be described as collision of a light quantum with an electron. The energy of the
light quantum is changed during the collision; and since the frequency times Planck's constant
should be the energy of the light quantum, the frequency also should be changed. But what
happens in this interpretation of the light wave? The two experiments – one on the interference
of scattered light and the other on the change of frequency of the scattered light – seemed to
contradict each other without any possibility of compromise.
By this time many physicists were convinced that these apparent contradictions belonged to
the intrinsic structure of atomic physics. Therefore, in 1924 de Broglie in France tried to extend
the dualism between wave description and particle description to the elementary particles of
matter, primarily to the electrons. He showed that a certain
9
matter wave could `correspond' to a moving electron, just as a light wave corresponds to a
moving light quantum. It was not clear at the time what the word `correspond' meant in this
connection. But de Broglie suggested that the quantum condition in Bohr
'
s theory should be
interpreted as a statement about the matter waves. A wave circling around a nucleus can for
geometrical reasons only be a stationary wave; and the perimeter of the orbit must be an
integer multiple of the wave length. In this way de Broglie's idea connected the quantum
condition, which always had been a foreign element in the mechanics of the electrons, with the
dualism between waves and particles.
In Bohr's theory the discrepancy between the calculated orbital frequency of the electrons and
the frequency of the emitted radiation had to be interpreted as a limitation to the concept of the
electronic orbit. This concept had been somewhat doubtful from the beginning. For the higher
orbits, however, the electrons should move at a large distance from the nucleus just as they do
when one sees them moving through a cloud chamber. There one should speak about electronic
orbits. It was therefore very satisfactory that for these higher orbits the frequencies of the
emitted radiation approach the orbital frequency and its higher harmonics. Also Bohr had already
suggested in his early papers that the intensities of the emitted spectral lines approach the
intensities of the corresponding harmonics. This principle of correspondence had proved very
useful for the approximative calculation of the intensities of spectral lines. In this way one had the
impression that Bohr's theory gave a qualitative but not a quantitative description of what
happens inside the atom; that some new feature of the behavior of matter was qualitatively
expressed by the quantum conditions, which in turn were connected with the dualism between 
waves and particles.
The precise mathematical formulation of quantum theory finally emerged from two different
developments. The one started from Bohr's principle of correspondence. One had to give up the
concept of the electronic orbit but still had to maintain it in the limit of high quantum numbers,
i.e., for the large orbits. In this latter case the emitted radiation, by means of its frequencies and
intensities, gives a picture of the electronic orbit; it represents what the mathematicians
10
call a Fourier expansion of the orbit. The idea suggested itself that one should write down the
mechanical laws not as equations for the positions and velocities of the electrons but as
equations for the frequencies and amplitudes of their Fourier expansion. Starting from such
equations and changing them very little one could hope to come to relations for those quantities
which correspond to the frequencies and intensities of the emitted radiation, even for the small
orbits and the ground state of the atom. This plan could actually be carried out; in the summer of
1925 it led to a mathematical formalism called matrix mechanics or, more generally, quantum
mechanics. The equations of motion in Newtonian mechanics were replaced by similar equations
between matrices; it was a strange experience to find that many of the old results of Newtonian
mechanics, like conservation of energy, etc., could be derived also in the new scheme. Later the
investigations of Born, Jordan and Dirac showed that the matrices representing position and
momentum of the electron do not commute. This latter fact demonstrated clearly the essential
difference between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics.
The other development followed de Broglie's idea of matter waves. Schrodinger tried to set up a
wave equation for de Broglie's stationary waves around the nucleus. Early in 1926 he succeeded
in deriving the energy values of the stationary states of the hydrogen atom as `Eigenvalues' of
his wave equation and could give a more general prescription for transforming a given set of
classical equations of motion into a corresponding wave equation in a space of many dimensions.
Later he was able to prove that his formalism of wave mechanics was mathematically equivalent
to the earlier formalism of quantum mechanics.
Thus one finally had a consistent mathematical formalism, which could be defined in two
equivalent ways starting either from relations between matrices or from wave equations. This
formalism gave the correct energy values for the hydrogen atom; it took less than one year to
show that it was also successful for the helium atom and the more complicated problems of the
heavier atoms. But in what sense did the new formalism describe the atom? The paradoxes of
the dualism between wave picture and particle picture were not
11
solved; they were hidden somehow in the mathematical scheme.
A first and very interesting step toward a real understanding of quantum theory was taken by
Bohr, Kramers and Slater in 1924. These authors tried to solve the apparent contradiction
between the wave picture and the particle picture by the concept of the probability wave. The
electromagnetic waves were interpreted not as `
real
'
 waves but as probability waves, the intensity
of which determines in every point the probability for the absorption (or induced emission) of a
light quantum by an atom at this point. This idea led to the conclusion that the laws of
conservation of energy and momentum need not be true for the single event, that they are only
statistical laws and are true only in the statistical average. This conclusion was not correct,
however, and the connections between the wave aspect and the particle aspect of radiation were
still more complicated.
But the paper of Bohr, Kramers and Slater revealed one essential feature of the correct
interpretation of quantum theory. This concept of the probability wave was something entirely 
new in theoretical physics since Newton. Probability in mathematics or in statistical mechanics
means a statement about our degree of knowledge of the actual situation. In throwing dice we
do not know the fine details of the motion of our hands which determine the fall of the dice and
therefore we say that the probability for throwing a special number is just one in six. The
probability wave of Bohr, Kramers, Slater, however, meant more than that; it meant a tendency for
something. It was a quantitative version of the old concept of `potentia'
 in Aristotelian
philosophy. It introduced something standing in the middle between the idea of an event and the
actual event, a strange kind of physical reality just in the middle between possibility and reality.
Later when the mathematical framework of quantum theory was fixed, Born took up this idea
of the probability wave and gave a clear definition of the mathematical quantity in the formalism,
which was to be interpreted as the probability wave. It was not a three-dimensional wave like
elastic or radio waves, but a wave in the many-dimensional configuration space, and therefore a
rather abstract mathematical quantity.
Even at this time, in the summer of 1926, it was not clear in every
12
case how the mathematical formalism should be used to describe a given experimental situation.
One knew how to describe the stationary states of an atom, but one did not know how to describe
a much simpler event — as for instance an electron moving through a cloud chamber.
When Schrodinger in that summer had shown that his formalism of wave mechanics was
mathematically equivalent to quantum mechanics he tried for some time to abandon the idea of
quanta and `quantum jumps' altogether and to replace the electrons in the atoms simply by his
three-dimensional matter waves. He was inspired to this attempt by his result, that the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom in his theory seemed to be simply the eigenfrequencies of the
stationary matter waves. Therefore, he thought it was a mistake to call them energies; they were
just frequencies. But in the discussions which took place in the autumn of 1926 in Copenhagen
between Bohr and Schrodinger and the Copenhagen group of physicists it soon became apparent
that such an interpretation would not even be sufficient to explain Planck's formula of heat
radiation.
During the months following these discussions an intensive study of all questions concerning
the interpretation of quantum theory in Copenhagen finally led to a complete and, as many
physicists believe, satisfactory clarification of the situation. But it was not a solution which one
could easily accept. I remember discussions with Bohr which went through many hours till very
late at night and ended almost in despair; and when at the end of the discussion I went alone for
a walk in the neighboring park I repeated to myself again and again the question: Can nature
possibly be as absurd as it seemed to us in these atomic experiments?
The final solution was approached in two different ways. The one was a turning around of the
question. Instead of asking: How can one in the known mathematical scheme express a given
experimental situation? the other question was put: Is it true, perhaps, that only such
experimental situations can arise in nature as can be expressed in the mathematical formalism?
The assumption that this was actually true led to limitations in the use of those concepts that had
been the basis of classical physics since Newton. One could speak of the position
13
and of the velocity of an electron as in Newtonian mechanics and one could observe and measure
these quantities. But one could not fix both quantities simultaneously with an arbitrarily high
accuracy. Actually the product of these two inaccuracies turned out to be not less than Planck's
constant divided by the mass of the particle. Similar relations could be formulated for other
experimental situations. They are usually called relations of uncertainty or principle of 
indeterminacy. One had learned that the old concepts fit nature only inaccurately.
The other way of approach was Bohr's concept of complementarity. Schrodinger had described
the atom as a system not of a nucleus and electrons but of a nucleus and matter waves. This
picture of the matter waves certainly also contained an element of truth. Bohr considered the
two pictures — particle picture and wave picture — as two complementary descriptions of the
same reality. Any of these descriptions can be only partially true, there must be limitations to
the use of the particle concept as well as of the wave concept, else one could not avoid
contradictions. If one takes into account those limitations which can be expressed by the
uncertainty relations, the contradictions disappear.
In this way since the spring of 1927 one has had a consistent interpretation of quantum
theory, which is frequently called the `Copenhagen interpretation.' This interpretation received
its crucial test in the autumn of 1927 at the Solvay conference in Brussels. Those experiments
which had always led to the worst paradoxes were again and again discussed in all details,
especially by Einstein. New ideal experiments were invented to trace any possible inconsistency of
the theory, but the theory was shown to be consistent and seemed to fit the experiments as far
as one could see.
The details of this Copenhagen interpretation will be the subject of the next chapter. It should
be emphasized at this point that it has taken more than a quarter of a century to get from the
first idea of the existence of energy quanta to a real understanding of the quantum theoretical
laws. This indicates the great change that had to take place in the fundamental concepts
concerning reality before one could understand the new situation.
