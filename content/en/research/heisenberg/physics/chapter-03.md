This starts from a paradox. 

Any physics experiment is described in the terms of classical physics.

The concepts of classical physics describe the arrangement of our experiments and state the results.

Yet the application of these concepts is limited by the relations of uncertainty. 

We must keep in mind this limited range of applicability of the classical
concepts while using them, but we cannot and should not try to improve them.
For a better understanding of this paradox it is useful to compare the procedure for the
theoretical interpretation of an experiment in classical physics and in quantum theory. 

In Newton's mechanics, we can measure the position and speed of a planet.

This leads to the planet's:
- co-ordinates
- momenta

Then the equations of motion are used to derive from these values of the coordinates and momenta.

In this way, the astronomer can predict the position of the planet at a later time.

It is different in quantum theory.

We can get the initial position and speed of the electron in a gas chamber.

But this determination will not be accurate.

These inaccuracies lead to the mathematical scheme of quantum theory. 

A probability function represents:
- the experimental situation at the time of the measurement
- the possible errors of the measurement

This probability function represents:


1. A fact 

2. Our knowledge of a fact

The function assigns at the initial time the probability unity (i.e., complete certainty) to the initial situation: the electron moving with the observed velocity at the observed position; 

`observed' means observed within the accuracy of the experiment. 

It represents our knowledge in so far as another observer could perhaps know the
position of the electron more accurately. The error in the experiment does – at least to some
extent – not represent a property of the electron but a deficiency in our knowledge of the
electron. 

Also this deficiency of knowledge is expressed in the probability function.

In classical physics one should in a careful investigation also consider the error of the
observation. 

As a result one would get a probability distribution for the initial values of the coordinates and velocities and therefore something very similar to the probability function in
quantum mechanics. Only the necessary uncertainty due to the uncertainty relations is lacking in
classical physics.

When the probability function in quantum theory has been deter-mined at the initial time from
the observation, one can from the laws of quantum theory calculate the probability function at
any later time and can thereby determine the probability for a measurement giving a specified
value of the measured quantity. We can, for instance, predict the probability for finding the
electron at a later time at a given point in the cloud chamber. It should be emphasized, however,
that the probability function does not in itself represent a course of events in the course of time.
It represents a tendency for events and our knowledge of events. The probability function can be
connected with reality only if one essential condition is fulfilled: if a new measure1 6
ment is made to determine a certain property of the system. Only then does the probability
function allow us to calculate the probable result of the new measurement. The result of the
measurement again will be stated in terms of classical physics.
Therefore, the theoretical interpretation of an experiment requires three distinct steps: (1) the
translation of the initial experimental situation into a probability function; (2) the following up of
this function in the course of time; (3) the statement of a new measurement to be made of the
system, the result of which can then be calculated from the probability function. For the first step
the fulfillment of the uncertainty relations is a necessary condition. The second step cannot be
described in terms of the classical concepts; there is no description of what happens to the system
between the initial observation and the next measurement. It is only in the third step that we
change over again from the `possible' to the `actual.'
Let us illustrate these three steps in a simple ideal experiment. It has been said that the atom
consists of a nucleus and electrons moving around the nucleus; it has also been stated that the
concept of an electronic orbit is doubtful. One could argue that it should at least in principle be
possible to observe the electron in its orbit. One should simply look at the atom through a
microscope of a very high resolving power, then one would see the electron moving in its orbit.
Such a high resolving power could to be sure not be obtained by a microscope using ordinary light,
since the inaccuracy of the measurement of the position can never be smaller than the wave
length of the light. But a microscope using y-rays with a wave length smaller than the size of the
atom would do. Such a microscrope has not yet been constructed but that should not prevent us
from discussing the ideal experiment.
Is the first step, the translation of the result of the observation into a probability function,
possible? It is possible only if the uncertainty relation is fulfilled after the observation. The
position of the electron will be known with an accuracy given by the wave length of the y-ray. The
electron may have been practically at rest before the observation. But in the act of observation at
least one light quantum of the y-ray must have passed the microscope and must first have been
deflected by the electron. Therefore, the electron has been pushed by the light
1 7
quantum, it has changed its momentum and its velocity, and one can show that the uncertainty
of this change is just big enough to guarantee the validity of the uncertainty relations. Therefore,
there is no difficulty with the first step.
At the same time one can easily see that there is no way of observing the orbit of the electron
around the nucleus. The second step shows a wave pocket moving not around the nucleus but
away from the atom, because the first light quantum will have knocked the electron out from the
atom. The momentum of light quantum of the y-ray is much bigger than the original momentum
of the electron if the wave length of the y-ray is much smaller than the size of the atom.
Therefore, the first light quantum is sufficient to knock the electron out of the atom and one can
never observe more than one point in the orbit of the electron; therefore, there is no orbit in the
ordinary sense. The next observation – the third step – will show the electron on its path from the
atom. Quite generally there is no way of describing what happens between two consecutive
observations. It is of course tempting to say that the electron must have been somewhere
between the two observations and that therefore the electron must have described some kind of
path or orbit even if it may be impossible to . know which path. This would be a reasonable
argument in classical physics. But in quantum theory it would be a misuse of the language which,
as we will see later, cannot be justified. We can leave it open for the moment, whether this
warning is a statement about the way in which we should talk about atomic events or a
statement about the events themselves, whether it refers to epistemology or to ontology. In any
case we have to be very cautious about the wording of any statement concerning the behavior of
atomic particles.
Actually we need not speak of particles at all. For many experiments it is more convenient to
speak of matter waves; for instance, of stationary matter waves around the atomic nucleus. Such
a description would directly contradict the other description if one does not pay attention to the
limitations given by the uncertainty relations. Through the limitations the contradiction is
avoided. The use of `matter waves' is convenient, for example, when dealing with the radiation
emitted by the atom. By means of its frequencies and
intensities the radiation gives information about the oscillating charge distribution in the atom, and
there the wave picture comes much nearer to the truth than the particle picture. Therefore, Bohr
advocated the use of both pictures, which he called `complementary' to each other. The two
pictures are of course mutually exclusive, because a certain thing cannot at the same time be a
particle (i.e., substance confined to a very small volume) and a wave (i.e., a field spread out over
a large space), but the two complement each other. By playing with both pictures, by going from
the one picture to the other and back again, we finally get the right impression of the strange
kind of reality behind our atomic experiments. Bohr uses the concept of `complementarity' at
several places in the interpretation of quantum theory. The knowledge of the position of a
particle is complementary to the knowledge of its velocity or momentum. If we know the one
with high accuracy we cannot know the other with high accuracy; still we must know both for
determining the behavior of the system. The space-time description of the atomic events is
complementary to their deterministic description. The probability function obeys an equation of 
motion as the co-ordinates did in Newtonian mechanics; its change in the course of time is
completely determined by the quantum mechanical equation, but it does not allow a description
in space and time. The observation, on the other hand, enforces the description in space and
time but breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by changing our knowledge
of the system.
Generally the dualism between two different descriptions of the same reality is no longer a difficulty since we know from the mathematical formulation of the theory that contradictions cannot arise. The dualism between the two complementary pictures – waves and particles – is also clearly brought out in the flexibility of the mathematical scheme. The formalism is normally written to resemble Newtonian mechanics, with equations of motion for the co-ordinates and the momenta of the particles. But by a simple transformation it can be rewritten to resemble a wave equation for an ordinary three-dimensional matter wave. Therefore, this possibility of playing with different complementary pictures has its analogy in the different transformations of the mathematical scheme; it does not lead to any
1 9
difficulties in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory.
A real difficulty in the understanding of this interpretation arises, however, when one asks the
famous question: But what happens `really' in an atomic event? It has been said before that the
mechanism and the results of an observation can always be stated in terms of the classical
concepts. But what one deduces from an observation is a probability function, a mathematical
expression that combines statements about possibilities or tendencies with statements about our
knowledge of facts. So we cannot completely objectify the result of an observation, we cannot
describe what `happens' between this observation and the next. This looks as if we had
introduced an element of subjectivism into the theory, as if we meant to say: what happens
depends on our way of observing it or on the fact that we observe it. Before discussing this
problem of subjectivism it is necessary to explain quite clearly why one would get into hopeless
difficulties if one tried to describe what happens between two consecutive observations.
For this purpose it is convenient to discuss the following ideal experiment: We assume that a
small source of monochromatic light radiates toward a black screen with two small holes in it. The
diameter of the holes may be not much bigger than the wave length of the light, but their distance
will be very much bigger. At some distance behind the screen a photographic plate registers the
incident light. If one describes this experiment in terms of the wave picture, one says that the
primary wave penetrates through the two holes; there will be secondary spherical waves starting
from the holes that interfere with one another, and the interference will produce a pattern of
varying intensity on the photographic plate.
The blackening of the photographic plate is a quantum process, a chemical reaction produced
by single light quanta. Therefore, it must also be possible to describe the experiment in terms of
light quanta. If it would be permissible to say what happens to the single light quantum between
its emission from the light source and its absorption in the photographic plate, one could argue as
follows: The single light quantum can come through the first hole or through the second one. If it
goes through the first hole and is scattered there, its probability
20
for being absorbed at a certain point of the photographic plate cannot depend upon whether the
second hole is closed or open. The probability distribution on the plate will be the same as if
only the first hole was open. If the experiment is repeated many times and one takes together
all cases in which the light quantum has gone through the first hole, the blackening of the plate 
due to these cases will correspond to this probability distribution. If one considers only those light
quanta that go through the second hole, the blackening should correspond to a probability
distribution derived from the assumption that only the second hole is open. The total blackening,
therefore, should just be the sum of the blackenings in the two cases; in other words, there
should be no interference pattern. But we know this is not correct, and the experiment will show
the interference pattern. Therefore, the statement that any light quantum must have gone either
through the first or through the second hole is problematic and leads to contradictions. This
example shows clearly that the concept of the probability function does not allow a description
of what happens between two observations. Any attempt to find such a description would lead
to contradictions; this must mean that the term `happens' is restricted to the observation.
Now, this is a very strange result, since it seems to indicate that the observation plays a
decisive role in the event and that the reality varies, depending upon whether we observe it or
not. To make this point clearer we have to analyze the process of observation more closely.
To begin with, it is important to remember that in natural science we are not interested in the
universe as a whole, including ourselves, but we direct our attention to some part of the universe
and make that the object of our studies. In atomic physics this part is usually a very small
object, an atomic particle or a group of such particles, sometimes much larger—the size does not
matter; but it is important that a large part of the universe, including ourselves, does not belong to
the object.
Now, the theoretical interpretation of an experiment starts with the two steps that have been
discussed. In the first step we have to describe the arrangement of the experiment, eventually
combined
21
with a first observation, in terms of classical physics and translate this description into a probability
function. This probability function follows the laws of quantum theory, and its change in the
course of time, which is continuous, can be calculated from the initial conditions; this is the
second step. The probability function combines objective and subjective elements. It contains
statements about possibilities or better tendencies ('potentia' in Aristotelian philosophy), and
these statements are completely objective, they do not depend on any observer; and it contains
statements about our knowledge of the system, which of course are subjective in so far as they
may be different for different observers. In ideal cases the subjective element in the probability
function may be practically negligible as compared with the objective one. The physicists then
speak of a `pure case.'
When we now come to the next observation, the result of which should be predicted from the
theory, it is very important to realize that our object has to be in contact with the other part of
the world, namely, the experimental arrangement, the measuring rod, etc., before or at least at the
moment of observation. This means that the equation of motion for the probability function does
now contain the influence of the interaction with the measuring device. This influence introduces a
new element of uncertainty, since the measuring device is necessarily described in the terms of
classical physics; such a description contains all the uncertainties concerning the microscopic
structure of the device which we know from thermodynamics, and since the device is connected
with the rest of the world, it contains in fact the uncertainties of the microscopic structure of the
whole world. These uncertainties may be called objective in so far as they are simply a
consequence of the description in the terms of classical physics and do not depend on any
observer. They may be called subjective in so far as they refer to our incomplete knowledge of
the world.
After this interaction has taken place, the probability function contains the objective element of
tendency and the subjective element of incomplete knowledge, even if it has been a `pure case
'
before. It is for this reason that the result of the observation cannot generally be predicted with
certainty; what can be predicted is the probability of a certain result of the observation, and this
statement about the
22
probability can be checked by repeating the experiment many times. The probability function
does — unlike the common procedure in Newtonian mechanics — not describe a certain event
but, at least during the process of observation, a whole ensemble of possible events.
The observation itself changes the probability function discontinuously; it selects of all possible
events the actual one that has taken place. Since through the observation our knowledge of the
system has changed discontinuously, its mathematical representation also has undergone the
discontinuous change and we speak of a `quantum jump.' When the old adage Natura non facit
saltus' is used as a basis for criticism of quantum theory, we can reply that certainly our
knowledge can change suddenly and that this fact justifies the use of the term `quantum jump.'
Therefore, the transition from the `possible' to the `actual'
 takes place during the act of
observation. If we want to describe what happens in an atomic event, we have to realize that the
word `happens' can apply only to the observation, not to the state of affairs between two
observations. It applies to the physical, not the psychical act of observation, and we may say that
the transition from the `possible' to the `actual' takes place as soon as the interaction of the
object with the measuring device, and thereby with the rest of the world, has come into play; it
is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer. The
discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration,
because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its
image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.
To what extent, then, have we finally come to an objective description of the world, especially of
the atomic world? In classical physics science started from the belief — or should one say from the
illusion? — that we could describe the world or at least parts of the world without any reference
to ourselves. This is actually possible to a large extent. We know that the city of London exists
whether we see it or not. It may be said that classical physics is just that idealization in which we
can speak about parts of the world without any reference
23
to ourselves. Its success has led to the general ideal of an objective description of the world.
Objectivity has become the first criterion for the value of any scientific result. Does the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory still comply with this ideal? One may perhaps say
that quantum theory corresponds to this ideal as far as possible. Certainly quantum theory does
not contain genuine subjective features, it does not introduce the mind of the physicist as a part
of the atomic event. But it starts from the division of the world into the `object' and the rest of
the world, and from the fact that at least for the rest of the world we use the classical concepts in
our description. This division is arbitrary and historically a direct consequence of our scientific
method; the use of the classical concepts is finally a consequence of the general human way of
thinking. But this is already a reference to ourselves and in so far our description is not completely
objective.
It has been stated in the beginning that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory
starts with a paradox. It starts from the fact that we describe our experiments in the terms of
classical physics and at the same time from the knowledge that these concepts do not fit nature
accurately. The tension between these two starting points is the root of the statistical character
of quantum theory. Therefore, it has sometimes been suggested that one should depart from the
classical concepts altogether and that a radical change in the concepts used for describing the
experiments might possibly lead back to a nonstatical, completely objective description of nature.
This suggestion, however, rests upon a misunderstanding. The concepts of classical physics
are just a refinement of the concepts of daily life and are an essential part of the language
which forms the basis of all natural science. Our actual situation in science is such that we do use
the classical concepts for the description of the experiments, and it was the problem of quantum 
theory to find theoretical interpretation of the experiments on this basis. There is no use in
discussing what could be done if we were other beings than we are. At this point we have to
realize, as von Weizsacker has put it, that `Nature is earlier than man, but man is earlier than
natural science.' The first part of the sentence justifies classical physics, with its ideal of
complete
24
objectivity. The second part tells us why we cannot escape the paradox of quantum theory,
namely, the necessity of using the classical concepts.
We have to add some comments on the actual procedure in the quantum-theoretical
interpretation of atomic events. It has been said that we always start with a division of the world
into an object, which we are going to study, and the rest of the world, and that this division is to
some extent arbitrary. It should indeed not make any difference in the final result if we, e.g., add
some part of the measuring device or the whole device to the object and apply the laws of
quantum theory to this more complicated object. It can be shown that such an alteration of the
theoretical treatment would not alter the predictions concerning a given experiment. This follows
mathematically from the fact that the laws of quantum theory are for the phenomena in which
Planck's constant can be considered as a very small quantity, approximately identical with the
classical laws. But it would be a mistake to believe that this application of the quantumtheoretical laws to the measuring device could help to avoid the fundamental paradox of
quantum theory.
The measuring device deserves this name only if it is in close contact with the rest of the world, if
there is an interaction between the device and the observer. Therefore, the uncertainty with
respect to the microscopic behavior of the world will enter into the quantum-theoretical system
here just as well as in the first interpretation. If the measuring device would be isolated from the
rest of the world, it would be neither a measuring device nor could it be described in the terms of
classical physics at all.
With regard to this situation Bohr has emphasized that it is more realistic to state that the
division into the object and the rest of the world is not arbitrary. Our actual situation in research
work in atomic physics is usually this: we wish to understand a certain phenomenon, we wish to
recognize how this phenomenon follows from the general laws of nature. Therefore, that part of
matter or radiation which takes part in the phenomenon is the natural `object' in the theoretical
treatment and should be separated in this respect from the tools used to study the phenomenon.
This again emphasizes a subjective element
25
in the description of atomic events, since the measuring device has been constructed by the
observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature
exposed to our method of questioning. Our scientific work in physics consists in asking questions
about nature in the language that we possess and trying to get an answer from experiment by
the means that are at our disposal. In this way quantum theory reminds us, as Bohr has put it, of
the old wisdom that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama
of existence we are ourselves both players and spectators. It is understandable that in our
scientific relation to nature our own activity becomes very important when we have to deal with
parts of nature into which we can penetrate only by using the most elaborate tools.

Quantum Theory and the Roots of Atomic Science
The concept of the atom goes back much further than the beginning of modern science in the
seventeenth century; it has its origin in ancient Greek philosophy and was in that early period the
central concept of materialism taught by Leucippus and Democritus. On the other hand, the
modern interpretation of atomic events has very little resemblance to genuine materialistic
philosophy; in fact, one may say that atomic physics has turned science away from the
materialistic trend it had during the nineteenth century. It is therefore interesting to compare the
development of Greek philosophy toward the concept of the atom with the present position of this
concept in modern physics.
The idea of the smallest, indivisible ultimate building blocks of matter first came up in
connection with the elaboration of the concepts of Matter, Being and Becoming which characterized
the first epoch of Greek philosophy. This period started in the sixth century BC with Thales, the
founder of the Milesian school, to whom Aristotle ascribes the statement: `Water is the material
cause of all things.' This statement, strange as it looks to us, expresses, as Nietzsche has pointed
out, three fundamental ideas of philosophy. First, the question as to the material cause of all
things; second, the demand that this question be answered in conformity with reason, without
resort to myths or mysticism; third, the postulate that ultimately it must be possible to reduce
everything to one principle. Thales' statement was the first expression of the idea of a
fundamental substance, of which all other things were transient forms. The word `substance' in
this connection was certainly in that age not interpreted in the purely material sense which we
frequently ascribe to it today. Life was connected with or
27
inherent in this `substance' and Aristotle ascribes to Thales also the statement: All things are full
of gods. Still the question was put as to the material cause of all things and it is not difficult to
imagine that Thales took his view primarily from meteorological considerations. Of all things we
know water can take the most various shapes; it can in the winter take the form of ice and snow,
it can change into vapor, and it can form the clouds. It seems to turn into earth where the rivers
form their delta, and it can spring from the earth. Water is the condition for life. Therefore, if
there was such a fundamental sub-stance, it was natural to think of water first.
The idea of the fundamental substance was then carried further by Anaximander, who was a
pupil of Thales and lived in the same town. Anaximander denied the fundamental substance to
be water or any of the known substances. He taught that the primary substance was infinite,
eternal and ageless and that it encompassed the world. This primary substance is transformed
into the various substances with which we are familiar. Theophrastus quotes from Anaximander:
`Into that from which things take their rise they pass away once more, as is ordained, for they
make reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of
time.' In this philosophy the antithesis of Being and Becoming plays the fundamental role. The
primary substance, infinite and ageless, the undifferentiated Being, degenerates into the various
forms which lead to endless struggles. The process of Becoming is considered as a sort of
debasement of the infinite Being – a disintegration into the struggle ultimately expiated by a
return into that which is without shape or character. The struggle which is meant here is the
opposition between hot and cold, fire and water, wet and dry, etc. The temporary victory of the
one over the other is the injustice for which they finally make reparation in the ordering of time.
According to Anaximander, there is `eternal motion,' the creation and passing away of worlds from 
infinity to infinity.
It may be interesting to notice at this point that the problem – whether the primary substance
can be one of the known substances or must be something essentially different – occurs in a
somewhat different form in the most modern part of atomic physics. The physicists today try to
find a fundamental law of motion for matter
28
from which all elementary particles and their properties can be derived mathematically. This
fundamental equation of motion may refer either to waves of a known type, to proton and meson
waves, or to waves of an essentially different character which have nothing to do with any of the
known waves or elementary particles. In the first case it would mean that all other elementary
particles can be reduced in some way to a few sorts of `
fundamental
'
 elementary particles; actually
theoretical physics has during the past two decades mostly followed this line of research. In the
second case all different elementary particles could be reduced to some universal substance which
we may call energy or matter, but none of the different particles could be preferred to the others
as being more fundamental. The latter view of course corresponds to the doctrine of
Anaximander, and I am convinced that in modern physics this view is the correct one. But let us
return to Greek philosophy.
The third of the Milesian philosophers, Anaximenes, an associate of Anaximander, taught that
air was the primary substance. `
Just as our soul, being air, holds us together, so do breath and air
encompass the whole world.' Anaximenes introduced into the Milesian philosophy the idea that
the process of condensation or rarefaction causes the change of the primary substance into the
other substances. The condensation of water vapor into clouds was an obvious example, and of
course the difference between water vapor and air was not known at that time.
In the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus the concept of Becoming occupies the foremost
place. He regarded that which moves, the fire, as the basic element. The difficulty, to reconcile
the idea of one fundamental principle with the infinite variety of phenomena, is solved for him by
recognizing that the strife of the opposites is really a kind of harmony. For Heraclitus the world is
at once one and many, it is just `the opposite tension'
 of the opposites that constitutes the unity
of the One. He says: `We must know that war is common to all and strife is justice, and that all
things come into being and pass away through strife.'
Looking back to the development of Greek philosophy up to this point one realizes that it has
been borne from the beginning to this
29
stage by the tension between the One and the Many. For our senses the world consists of an
infinite variety of things and events, colors and sounds. But in order to understand it we have to
introduce some kind of order, and order means to recognize what is equal, it means some sort
of unity. From this springs the belief that there is one fundamental principle, and at the same
time the difficulty to derive from it the infinite variety of things. That there should be a material
cause for all things was a natural starting point since the world consists of matter. But when one
carried the idea of fundamental unity to the extreme one came to that infinite and eternal
undifferentiated Being which, whether material or not, cannot in itself explain the infinite variety
of things. This leads to the antithesis of Being and Becoming and finally to the solution of
Heraclitus, that the change itself is the fundamental principle; the `
imperishable change, that
renovates the world,' as the poets have called it. But the change in itself is not a material cause
and therefore is represented in the philosophy of Heraclitus by the fire as the basic element,
which is both matter and a moving force.
We may remark at this point that modern physics is in some way extremely near to the 
doctrines of Heraclitus. If we replace the word `fire' by the word `energy' we can almost repeat
his statements word for word from our modern point of view. Energy is in fact the substance
from which all elementary particles, all atoms and therefore all things are made, and energy is
that which moves. Energy is a substance, since its total amount does not change, and the
elementary particles can actually be made from this substance as is seen in many experiments on
the creation of elementary particles. Energy can be changed into motion, into heat, into light
and into tension. Energy may be called the fundamental cause for all change in the world. But this
comparison of Greek philosophy with the ideas of modern science will be discussed later.
Greek philosophy returned for some time to the concept of the One in the teachings of
Parmenides, who lived in Elea in the south of Italy. His most important contribution to Greek
thinking was, perhaps, that he introduced a purely logical argument into metaphysics. `One
cannot know what is not — that is impossible — nor utter it; for
30
it is the same thing that can be thought and that can be.' Therefore, only the One is, and there is
no becoming or passing away. Parmenides denied the existence of empty space for logical
reasons. Since all change requires empty space, as he assumed, he dismissed change as an
illusion.
But philosophy could not rest for long on this paradox. Empedocles, from the south coast of
Sicily, changed for the first time from monism to a kind of pluralism. To avoid the difficulty that
one primary substance cannot explain the variety of things and events, he assumed four basic
elements, earth, water, air and fire. The elements are mixed together and separated by the action
of Love and Strife. Therefore, these latter two, which are in many ways treated as corporeal like
the other four elements, are responsible for the imperishable change. Empedocles describes the
formation of the world in the following picture: First, there is the infinite Sphere of the One, as in
the philosophy of Parmenides. But in the primary substance all the four `
roots' are mixed
together by Love. Then, when Love is passing out and Strife coming in, the elements are partially
separated and partially combined. After that the elements are completely separated and Love is
outside the World. Finally, Love is bringing the elements together again and Strife is passing out,
so that we return to the original Sphere.
This doctrine of Empedocles represents a very definite turning toward a more materialistic
view in Greek philosophy. The four elements are not so much fundamental principles as real
material substances. Here for the first time the idea is expressed that the mixture and separation
of a few substances, which are fundamentally different, explains the infinite variety of things and
events. Pluralism never appeals to those who are wont to think in fundamental principles. But it
is a reasonable kind of compromise, which avoids the difficulty of monism and allows the
establishment of some order.
The next step toward the concept of the atom was made by Anaxagoras, who was a
contemporary of Empedocles. He lived in Athens about thirty years, probably in the first half of
the fifth century BC. Anaxagoras stresses the idea of the mixture, the assumption that all change
is caused by mixture and separation. He assumes an infinite variety of infinitely small `seeds,' of
which all things are composed.
31
The seeds do not refer to the four elements of Empedocles, there are innumerably many
different seeds. But the seeds are mixed together and separated again and in this way all change
is brought about. The doctrine of Anaxagoras allows for the first time a geometrical interpretation
of the term `mixture': Since he speaks of the infinitely small seeds, their mixture can be pictured
as the mixture between two kinds of sand of different colors. The seeds may change in number 
and in relative position. Anaxagoras assumes that all seeds are in everything, only the proportion
may change from one thing to another. He says: `All things will be in everything; nor is it
possible for them to be apart, but all things have a portion of everything.'
 The universe of
Anaxagoras is set in motion not by Love and Strife, like that of Empedocles, but by `Nous,' which
we may translate as `Mind.'
From this philosophy it was only one step to the concept of the atom, and this step occurred
with Leucippus and Democritus of Abdera. The antithesis of Being and Not-being in the
philosophy of Parmenides is here secularized into the antithesis of the `Full' and the `Void.' Being
is not only One, it can be repeated an infinite number of times. This is the atom, the indivisible
smallest unit of matter. The atom is eternal and indestructible, but it has a finite size. Motion is
made possible through the empty space between the atoms. Thus for the first time in history
there was voiced the idea of the existence of smallest ultimate particles – we would say of
elementary particles, as the fundamental building blocks of matter.
According to this new concept of the atom, matter did not consist only of the `Full,' but also of
the `Void,' of the empty space in which the atoms move. The logical objection of Parmenides
against the Void, that not-being cannot exist, was simply ignored to comply with experience.
From our modern point of view we would say that the empty space between the atoms in the
philosophy of Democritus was not nothing; it was the carrier for geometry and kinematics,
making possible the various arrangements and movements of atoms. But the possibility of empty
space has always been a controversial problem in philosophy. In the theory of general relativity the
answer is given that geometry is produced by matter or matter by geometry. This answer
corresponds more closely to the view held by many philosophers that
32
space is defined by the extension of matter. But Democritus clearly departs from this view, to
make change and motion possible.
The atoms of Democritus were all of the same substance, which had the property of being, but
had different sizes and different shapes. They were pictured therefore as divisible in a
mathematical but not in a physical sense. The atoms could move and could occupy different
positions in space. But they had no other physical properties. They had neither color nor smell
nor taste. The properties of matter which we perceive by our senses were supposed to be
produced by the movements and positions of the atoms in space. Just as both tragedy and
comedy can be written by using the same letters of the alphabet, the vast variety of events in
this world can be realized by the same atoms through their different arrangements and
movements. Geometry and kinematics, which were made possible by the void, proved to be still
more important in some way than pure being. Democritus is quoted to have said: `A thing merely
appears to have color, it merely appears to be sweet or bitter. Only atoms and empty space have a
real existence.'

The atoms in the philosophy of Leucippus do not move merely by chance. 

Leucippus seems to have believed in complete determinism, since he is known to have said: `Naught happens for
nothing, but everything from a ground and of necessity.' The atomists did not give any reason for
the original motion of the atoms, which just shows that they thought of a causal description of
the atomic motion; causality can only explain later events by earlier events, but it can never
explain the beginning.
The basic ideas of atomic theory were taken over and modified, in part, by later Greek
philosophers. For the sake of comparison with modern atomic physics it is important to mention
the explanation of matter given by Plato in his dialogue Timaeus. Plato was not an atomist; on
the contrary, Diogenes Laertius reported that Plato disliked Democritus so much that he wished
all his books to be burned. But Plato combined ideas that were near to atomism with the doctrines
of the Pythagorean school and the teachings of Empedocles.
The Pythagorean school was an offshoot of Orphism, which goes back to the worship of 
Dionysus. Here has been established the
33
connection between religion and mathematics which ever since has exerted the strongest
influence on human thought. The Pythagoreans seem to have been the first to realize the
creative force inherent in mathematical formulations. Their discovery that two strings sound in
harmony if their lengths are in a simple ratio demonstrated how much mathematics can mean for
the understanding of natural phenomena. For the Pythagoreans it was not so much a question of
understanding. For them them the simple mathematical ratio between the length of the strings
created the harmony in sound. There was also much mysticism in the doctrines of the
Pythagorean school which for us is difficult to understand. But by making mathematics a part of
their religion they touched an essential point in the development of human thought. I may quote
a statement by Bertrand Russell about Pythagoras: `I do not know of any other man who has
been as influential as he was in the sphere of thought.'
Plato knew of the discovery of the regular solids made by the Pythagoreans and of the
possibility of combining them with the elements of Empedocles. He compared the smallest parts
of the element earth with the cube, of air with the octahedron, of fire with the tetrahedron, and
of water with the icsahedron. There is no element that corresponds to the dodecahedron; here
Plato only says `
there was yet a fifth combination which God used in the delineation of the
universe.'
If the regular solids, which represent the four elements, can be compared with the atoms at
all, it is made clear by Plato that they are not invisible. Plato constructs the regular solids from
two basic triangles, the equilateral and the isosceles triangles, which are put together to form the
surface of the solids. Therefore, the elements can (at least partly) be transformed into each other.
The regular solids can be taken apart into their triangles and new regular solids can be formed of
them. For instance, one tetrahedron and two octahedra can be taken apart into twenty
equilateral triangles, which can be recombined to give one icosahedron. That means: one atom
of fire and two atoms of air can be combined to give one atom of water. But the fundamental
triangles cannot be considered as matter, since they have no extension in space. It is only when
the triangles are put
34
together to form a regular solid that a unit of matter is created. The smallest parts of matter are
not the fundamental Beings, as in the philosophy of Democritus, but are mathematical forms.
Here it is quite evident that the form is more important than the substance of which it is the
form.
After this short survey of Greek philosophy up to the formation of the concept of the atom we
may come back to modern physics and ask how our modern views on the atom and on quantum
theory compare with this ancient development. Historically the word `atom' in modern physics
and chemistry was referred to the wrong object, during the revival of science in the seventeenth
century, since the smallest particles belonging to what is called a chemical element are still rather
complicated systems of smaller units. These smaller units are nowadays called elementary
particles, and it is obvious that if anything in modern physics should be compared with the atoms
of Democritus it should be the elementary particles like proton, neutron, electron, meson.
Democritus was well aware of the fact that if the atoms should, by their motion and
arrangement, explain the properties of matter – color, smell, taste – they cannot themselves have
these properties. Therefore, he has deprived the atom of these qualities and his atom is thus a
rather abstract piece of matter. But Democritus has left to the atom the quality of `being,' of
extension in space, of shape and motion. He has left these qualities because it would have been 
difficult to speak about the atom at all if such qualities had been taken away from it. On the other
hand, this implies that his concept of the atom cannot explain geometry, extension in space or
existence, because it cannot reduce them to something more fundamental. The modern view of
the elementary particle with regard to this point seems more consistent and more radical. Let us
discuss the question: What is an elementary particle? We say, for instance, simply `a neutron'
but we can give no well-defined picture and what we mean by the word. We can use several
pictures and describe it once as a particle, once as a wave or as a wave packet. But we know that
none of these descriptions is accurate. Certainly the neutron has no color, no smell, no taste. In
this respect it resembles the atom of Greek philosophy. But even the
35
other qualities are taken from the elementary particle, at least to some extent; the concepts of
geometry and kinematics, like shape or motion in space, cannot be applied to it consistently. If
one wants to give an accurate description of the elementary particle — and here the emphasis is on
the word `accurate' — the only thing which can be written down as description is a probability
function. But then one sees that not even the quality of being (if that may be called a `quality'
)
belongs to what is described. It is a possibility for being or a tendency for being. Therefore, the
elementary particle of modern physics is still far more abstract than the atom of the Greeks, and
it is by this very property more consistent as a clue for explaining the behavior of matter.
In the philosophy of Democritus all atoms consist of the same substance if the word
`substance' is to be applied here at all. The elementary particles in modern physics carry a mass
in the same limited sense in which they have other properties. Since mass and energy are,
according to the theory of relativity, essentially the same concepts, we may say that all
elementary particles consist of energy. This could be interpreted as defining energy as the primary
substance of the world. It has indeed the essential property belonging to the term `
substance,
'
that it is conserved. Therefore, it has been mentioned before that the views of modern physics are
in this respect very close to those of Heraclitus if one interprets his element fire as meaning
energy. Energy is in fact that which moves; it may be called the primary cause of all change, and
energy can be transformed into matter or heat or light. The strife between opposites in the
philosophy of Heraclitus can be found in the strife between two different forms of energy.
In the philosophy of Democritus the atoms are eternal and indestructible units of matter, they
can never be transformed into each other. With regard to this question modern physics takes a
definite stand against the materialism of Democritus and for Plato and the Pythagoreans. The
elementary particles are certainly not eternal and indestructible units of matter, they can actually
be transformed into each other. As a matter of fact, if two such particles, moving through space
with a very high kinetic energy, collide, then many new elementary particles may be created from
the available energy and the old
36
particles may have disappeared in the collision. Such events have been frequently observed and
offer the best proof that all particles are made of the same substance: energy. But the
resemblance of the modern views to those of Plato and the Pythagoreans can be carried somewhat
further. The elementary particles in Plato's Timaeus are finally not substance but mathematical
forms. `All things are numbers' is a sentence attributed to Pythagoras. The only mathematical
forms avail-able at that time were such geometric forms as the regular solids or the triangles
which form their surface. In modern quantum theory there can be no doubt that the elementary
particles will finally also be mathematical forms, but of a much more complicated nature. The
Greek philosophers thought of static forms and found them in the regular solids. Modern science,
however, has from its beginning in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries started from the 
dynamic problem. The constant element in physics since Newton is not a configuration or a
geometrical form, but a dynamic law. The equation of motion holds at all times, it is in this sense
eternal, whereas the geometrical forms, like the orbits, are changing. Therefore, the
mathematical forms that represent the elementary particles will be solutions of some eternal law
of motion for matter. Actually this is a problem which has not yet been solved. The fundamental
law of motion for matter is not yet known and therefore it is not yet possible to derive
mathematically the properties of the elementary particles from such a law. But theoretical physics
in its present state seems to be not very far from this goal and we can at least say what kind of
law we have to expect. The final equation of motion for matter will probably be some quantized
nonlinear wave equation for a wave field of operators that simply represents matter, not any
specified kind of waves or particles. This wave equation will probably be equivalent to rather
complicated sets of integral equations, which have `Eigenvalues' and `Eigensolutions,
'
 as the
physicists call it. These Eigensolutions will finally represent the elementary particles; they are the
mathematical forms which shall replace the regular solids of the Pythagoreans. We might
mention here that these `Eigensolutions' will follow from the fundamental equation for matter by
much the same mathematical process by which the harmonic vibrations of the Pythagorean string
37
follow from the differential equation of the string. Butt, as has been said, these problems are not
yet solved.
If we follow the Pythagorean line of thought we mays hope that the fundamental law of
motion will turn out as a mathematically simple law, even if its evaluation with respect to the
Eigenstatees may be very complicated. It is difficult to give any good argumentt for this hope for
simplicity – except the fact that it has hitherto alwayss been possible to write the fundamental
equations in physics in simple mathematical forms. This fact fits in with the Pythagorean
religicon, and many physicists share their belief in this respect, but no convinicing argument has
yet been given to show that it must be so.
We may add an argument at this point concerning a (question which is frequently asked by
laymen with respect to the cconcept of the elementary particle in modern physics: Why do the
physicists claim that their elementary particles cannot be divided into smaller bits? The answer to
this question clearly shows how muchL more abstract modern science is as compared to Greek
philosophy. The argument runs like this: How could one divide an elementary parrticle? Certainly
only by using extreme forces and very sharp tools. The only tools available are other elementary
particles. Therefore, colilisions between two elementary particles of extremely high energy would
be the only processes by which the particles could eventually be diivided. Actually they can be
divided in such processes, sometimes unto very many fragments; but the fragments are again
elementary pan-tides, not any smaller pieces of them, the masses of these fragments; resulting
from the very large kinetic energy of the two colliding parrticles. In other words, the
transmutation of energy into matter makes it possible that the fragments of elementary particles
are again the saame elementary particles.
After this comparison of the modern views in atonnic physics with Greek philosophy we have
to add a warning, that tihis comparison should not be misunderstood. It may seem at first sighit
that the Greek philosophers have by some kind of ingenious intuitiion come to the same or very
similar conclusions as we have in modern times only after several centuries of hard labor with
experimeints and mathematics. This interpretation of our comparison would, however, be a
38
complete misunderstanding. There is an enormous difference between modern science and Greek
philosophy, and that is just the empiristic attitude of modern science. Since the time of Galileo
and Newton, modern science has been based upon a detailed study of nature and upon the 
postulate that only such statements should be made, as have been verified or at least can be
verified by experiment. The idea that one could single out some events from nature by an
experiment, in order to study the details and to find out what is the constant law in the
continuous change, did not occur to the Greek philosophers. Therefore, modern science has from
its beginning stood upon a much more modest, but at the same time much firmer, basis than
ancient philosophy. Therefore, the statements of modern physics are in some way meant much
more seriously than the statements of Greek philosophy. When Plato says, for instance, that the
smallest particles of fire are tetrahedrons, it is not quite easy to see what he really means. Is the
form of the tetrahedron only symbolically attached to the element fire, or do the smallest particles
of fire mechanically act as rigid tetrahedrons or as elastic tetrahedrons, and by what force could
they be separated into the equilateral triangles, etc.? Modern science would finally always ask:
How can one decide experimentally that the atoms of fire are tetrahedrons and not perhaps
cubes? Therefore, when modern science states that the proton is a certain solution of a
fundamental equation of matter it means that we can from this solution deduce mathematically
all possible properties of the proton and can check the correctness of the solution by experiments
in every detail. This possibility of checking the correctness of a statement experimentally with
very high precision and in any number of details gives an enormous weight to the statement that
could not be attached to the statements of early Greek philosophy.
All the same, some statements of ancient philosophy are rather near to those of modern
science. This simply shows how far one can get by combining the ordinary experience of nature
that we have without doing experiments with the untiring effort to get some logical order into this
experience to understand it from general principles.

The Development of Philosophical Ideas Since Descartes in Comparison with
the New Situation in Quantum Theory
In the two thousand years that followed the culmination of Greek science and culture in the fifth
and fourth centuries BC the human mind was to a large extent occupied with problems of a
different kind from those of the early period. In the first centuries of Greek culture the strongest
impulse had come from the immediate reality of the world in which we live and which we
perceive by our senses. This reality was full of life and there was no good reason to stress the
distinction between matter and mind or between body and soul. But in the philosophy of Plato
one already sees that another reality begins to become stronger. In the famous simile of the cave
Plato compares men to prisoners in a cave who are bound and can look in only one direction.
They have a fire behind them and see on a wall the shadows of themselves and of objects behind
them. Since they see nothing but the shadows, they regard those shadows as real and are not
aware of the objects. Finally one of the prisoners escapes and comes from the cave into the light
of the sun. For the first time he sees real things and realizes that he had been deceived hitherto
by the shadows. For the first time he knows the truth and thinks only with sorrow of his long life
in the darkness. The real philosopher is the prisoner who has escaped from the cave into the
light of truth, he is the one who possesses real knowledge. This immediate connection with truth
or, we may in the Christian sense say, with God is the new reality that has begun to become
stronger than the reality of the world as perceived by our senses. The immediate connection with
God happens within the human soul, not in the world, and this was the problem that occupied
human thought more than anything else in the two thousand years following Plato. In this period
the eyes of the philosophers were
40
directed toward the human soul and its relation to God, to the problems of ethics, and to the
interpretation of the revelation but not to the outer world. It was only in the time of the Italian
Renaissance that again a gradual change of the human mind could be seen, which resulted finally
in a revival of the interest in nature.
The great development of natural science since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was
preceded and accompanied by a development of philosophical ideas which were closely
connected with the fundamental concepts of science. It may therefore be instructive to comment
on these ideas from the position that has finally been reached by modern science in our time.
The first great philosopher of this new period of science was Rene Descartes who lived in the
first half of the seventeenth century. Those of his ideas that are most important for the
development of scientific thinking are contained in his Discourse on Method. On the basis of doubt
and logical reasoning he tries to find a completely new and as he thinks solid ground for a
philosophical system. He does not accept revelation as such a basis nor does he want to accept
uncritically what is perceived by the senses. So he starts with his method of doubt. He casts his
doubt upon that which our senses tell us about the results of our reasoning and finally he arrives
at his famous sentence: `
cogito ergo sum.' I cannot doubt my existence since it follows from the
fact that I am thinking. After establishing the existence of the I in this way he proceeds to prove
the existence of God essentially on the lines of scholastic philosophy. Finally the existence of the
world follows from the fact that God had given me a strong inclination to believe in the existence
of the world, and it is simply impossible that God should have deceived me.
This basis of the philosophy of Descartes is radically different from that of the ancient Greek
philosophers. Here the starting point is not a fundamental principle or substance, but the attempt
of a fundamental knowledge. And Descartes realizes that what we know about our mind is more
certain than what we know about the outer world. But already his starting point with the `triangle'
God-World-I simplifies in a dangerous way the basis for further reasoning. The division between
matter and mind or between soul and body, which had started in
41
Plato's philosophy, is now complete. God is separated both from the I and from the world. God in
fact is raised so high above the world and men that He finally appears in the philosophy of
Descartes only as a common point of reference that establishes the relation between the I and
the world.
While ancient Greek philosophy had tried to find order in the infinite variety of things and
events by looking for some fundamental unifying principle, Descartes tries to establish the order
through some fundamental division. But the three parts which result from the division lose some
of their essence when any one part is considered as separated from the other two parts. If one
uses the fundamental concepts of Descartes at all, it is essential that God is in the world and in the
I and it is also essential that the I cannot be really separated from the world. Of course Descartes
knew the undisputable necessity of the connection, but philosophy and natural science in the
following period developed on the basis of the polarity between the `res cogitans' and the `
res
extensa,' and natural science concentrated its interest on the `res extensa.' The influence of the
Cartesian division on human thought in the following centuries can hardly be overestimated, but
it is just this division which we have to criticize later from the development of physics in our time.
Of course it would be wrong to say that Descartes, through his new method in philosophy, has
given a new direction to human thought. What he actually did was to formulate for the first time
a trend in human thinking that could already be seen during the Renaissance in Italy and in the
Reformation. There was the revival of interest in mathematics which expressed an increasing
influence of Platonic elements in philosophy, and the insistence on personal religion. The growing 
interest in mathematics favored a philosophical system that started from logical reasoning and
tried by this method to arrive at some truth that was as certain as a mathematical conclusion.
The insistence on personal religion separated the I and its relation to God from the world. The
interest in the combination of empirical knowledge with mathematics as seen in the work of
Galileo was perhaps partly due to the possibility of arriving in this way at some knowledge that
could be kept apart completely from the theological
42
disputes raised by the Reformation. This empirical knowledge could be formulated without
speaking about God or about ourselves and favored the separation of the three fundamental
concepts God-World-I or the separation between `res cogitans' and `res extensa.' In this period
there was in some cases an explicit agreement among the pioneers of empirical science that in
their discussions the name of God or a fundamental cause should not be mentioned.
On the other hand, the difficulties of the separation could be clearly seen from the beginning.
In the distinction, for instance, between the `res cogitans' and the `
res extensa'
 Descartes was
forced to put the animals entirely on the side of the `
res extensa.' Therefore, the animals and the
plants were not essentially different from machines, their behavior was completely determined
by material causes. But it has always seemed difficult to deny completely the existence of some
kind of soul in the animals, and it seems to us that the older concept of soul for instance in the
philosophy of Thomas Aquinas was more natural and less forced than the Cartesian concept of
the `res cogitans,' even if we are convinced that the laws of physics and chemistry are strictly
valid in living organisms. One of the later consequences of this view of Descartes was that, if
animals were simply considered as machines, it was difficult not to think the same about men.
Since, on the other hand, the `
res cogitans'
 and the `
res extensa' were taken as completely
different in their essence, it did not seem possible that they could act upon each other.
Therefore, in order to preserve complete parallelism between the experiences of the mind and of
the body, the mind also was in its activities completely determined by laws which corresponded
to the laws of physics and chemistry. Here the question of the possibility of `free will' arose.
Obviously this whole description is somewhat artificial and shows the grave defects of the
Cartesian partition.
On the other hand in natural science the partition was for several centuries extremely
successful. The mechanics of Newton and all the other parts of classical physics constructed after
its model started from the assumption that one can describe the world without speaking about
God or ourselves. This possibility soon seemed almost a necessary condition for natural science
in general.
43
But at this point the situation changed to some extent through quantum theory and therefore
we may now come to a comparison of Descartes's philosophical system with our present situation
in modern physics. It has been pointed out before that in the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum theory we can indeed proceed without mentioning ourselves as individuals, but we
cannot disregard the fact that natural science is formed by men. Natural science does not simply
describe and explain nature; it is a part of the interplay between nature and ourselves; it
describes nature as exposed to our method of questioning. This was a possibility of which
Descartes could not have thought, but it makes the sharp separation between the world and the I
impossible.
If one follows the great difficulty which even eminent scientists like Einstein had in
understanding and accepting the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, one can trace
the roots of this difficulty to the Cartesian partition. This partition has penetrated deeply into the 
human mind during the three centuries following Descartes and it will take a long time for it to
be replaced by a really different attitude toward the problem of reality.
The position to which the Cartesian partition has led with respect to the `
res extensa' was what
one may call metaphysical realism. The world, i.e., the extended things, `exist.' This is to be
distinguished from practical realism, and the different forms of realism may be described as
follows: We `objectivate' a statement if we claim that its content does not depend on the
conditions under which it can be verified. Practical realism assumes that there are statements
that can be objectivated and that in fact the largest part of our experience in daily life consists of
such statements. Dogmatic realism claims that there are no statements concerning the material
world that cannot be objectivated. Practical realism has always been and will always be an
essential part of natural science. Dogmatic realism, however, is, as we see it now, not a necessary
condition for natural science. But it has in the past played a very important role in the
development of science; actually the position of classical physics is that of dogmatic realism. It is
only through quantum theory that we have learned that exact science is possible without the
basis of dogmatic realism. When
44
Einstein has criticized quantum theory he has done so from the basis of dogmatic realism. This is
a very natural attitude. Every scientist who does research work feels that he is looking for
something that is objectively true. His statements are not meant to depend upon the conditions
under which they can be verified. Especially in physics the fact that we can explain nature by
simple mathematical laws tells us that here we have met some genuine feature of reality, not
something that we have — in any meaning of the word — invented ourselves. This is the situation
which Einstein had in mind when he took dogmatic realism as the basis for natural science. But
quantum theory is in itself an example for the possibility of explaining nature by means of simple
mathematical laws without this basis. These laws may perhaps not seem quite simple when one
compares them with Newtonian mechanics. But, judging from the enormous complexity of the
phenomena which are to be explained (for instance, the line spectra of complicated atoms), the
mathematical scheme of quantum theory is comparatively simple. Natural science is actually
possible without the basis of dogmatic realism.
Metaphysical realism goes one step further than dogmatic realism by saying that `the things
really exist.'
 This is in fact what Descartes tried to prove by the argument that `God cannot have
deceived us.' The statement that the things really exist is different from the statement of dogmatic
realism in so far as here the word `exists' occurs, which is also meant in the other statement
`
cogito ergo sum' . . . `I think, therefore I am.' But it is difficult to see what is meant at this point
that is not yet contained in the thesis of dogmatic realism; and this leads us to a general criticism
of the statement `
cogito ergo sum,' which Descartes considered as the solid ground on which he
could build his system. It is in fact true that this statement has the certainty of a mathematical
conclusion, if the words `
cogito' and `
sum' are defined in the usual way or, to put it more
cautiously and at the same time more critically, if the words are so defined that the statement
follows. But this does not tell us anything about how far we can use the concepts of `
thinking'
and `being' in finding our way. It is finally in a very general sense always an empirical question
how far our concepts can be applied.
45
The difficulty of metaphysical realism was felt soon after Descartes and became the starting
point for the empiristic philosophy, for sensualism and positivism.
The three philosophers who can be taken as representatives for early empiristic philosophy are
Locke, Berkeley and Hume. Locke holds, contrary to Descartes, that all knowledge is ultimately 
founded in experience. This experience may be sensation or perception of the operation of our
own mind. Knowledge, so Locke states, is the perception of the agreement or disagreement of
two ideas. The next step was taken by Berkeley. If actually all our knowledge is derived from
perception, there is no meaning in the statement that the things really exist; because if the
perception is given it cannot possibly make any difference whether the things exist or do not exist.
Therefore, to be perceived is identical with existence. This line of argument then was extended to
an extreme skepticism by Hume, who denied induction and causation and thereby arrived at a
conclusion which if taken seriously would destroy the basis of all empirical science.
The criticism of metaphysical realism which has been expressed in empiristic philosophy is
certainly justified in so far as it is a warning against the naive use of the term `existence.' The
positive statements of this philosophy can be criticized on similar lines. Our perceptions are not
primarily bundles of colors or sounds; what we perceive is already perceived as something, the
accent here being on the word `thing,'
 and therefore it is doubtful whether we gain anything by
taking the perceptions instead of the things as the ultimate elements of reality.
The underlying difficulty has been clearly recognized by modern positivism. This line of thought
expresses criticism against the naive use of certain terms like `
thing,"perception,"existence' by the
general postulate that the question whether a given sentence has any meaning at all should
always be thoroughly and critically examined. This postulate and its underlying attitude are
derived from mathematical logic. The procedure of natural science is pictured as an attachment
of symbols to the phenomena. The symbols can, as in mathematics, be combined according to
certain rules, and in this way statements about the phenomena can be represented by
combinations of symbols.
46
However, a combination of symbols that does not comply with the rules is not wrong but
conveys no meaning.
The obvious difficulty in this argument is the lack of any general criterion as to when a
sentence should be considered as meaningless. A definite decision is possible only when the
sentence belongs to a closed system of concepts and axioms, which in the development of
natural science will be rather the exception than the rule. In some cases the conjecture that a
certain sentence is meaningless has historically led to important progress, for it opened the way
to the establishment of new connections which would have been impossible if the sentence had a
meaning. An example in quantum theory that has already been discussed is the sentence: `
In
which orbit does the electron move around the nucleus?
'
 But generally the positivistic scheme
taken from mathematical logic is too narrow in a description of nature which necessarily uses
words and concepts that are only vaguely defined.
The philosophic thesis that all knowledge is ultimately founded in experience has in the end led
to a postulate concerning the logical clarification of any statement about nature. Such a postulate
may have seemed justified in the period of classical physics, but since quantum theory we have
learned that it cannot be fulfilled. The words `position' and `velocity' of an electron, for instance,
seemed perfectly well defined as to both their meaning and their possible connections, and in
fact they were clearly defined concepts within the mathematical framework of Newtonian
mechanics. But actually they were not well defined, as is seen from the relations of uncertainty.
One may say that regarding their position in Newtonian mechanics they were well defined, but in
their relation to nature they were not. This shows that we can never know beforehand which
limitations will be put on the applicability of certain concepts by the extension of our knowledge
into the remote parts of nature, into which we can only penetrate with the most elaborate tools.
Therefore, in the process of penetration we are bound sometimes to use our concepts in a way
which is not justified and which carries no meaning. Insistence on the postulate of complete
logical clarification would make science impossible. We are reminded here by modern physics of
the old wisdom that the one who insists on never uttering an error must remain silent.
47
A combination of those two lines of thought that started from Descartes, on the one side, and
from Locke and Berkeley, on the other, was attempted in the philosophy of Kant, who was the
founder of German idealism. That part of his work which is important in comparison with the
results of modern physics is contained in The Critique of Pure Reason. He takes up the question
whether knowledge is only founded in experience or can come from other sources, and he arrives
at the conclusion that our knowledge is in part `a priori
'
 and not inferred inductivity from
experience. Therefore, he distinguishes between `empirical'
 knowledge and knowledge that is `a
priori.'
 At the same time he distinguishes between `analytic' and `synthetic' propositions. Analytic
propositions follow simply from logic, and their denial would lead to self-contradiction.
Propositions that are not `analytic' are called `synthetic.'
What is, according to Kant, the criterion for knowledge being `a priori'? Kant agrees that all
knowledge starts with experience but he adds that it is not always derived from experience. It is
true that experience teaches us that a certain thing has such or such properties, but it does not
teach us that it could not be different. Therefore, if a proposition is thought together with its
necessity it must be `a priori.' Experience never gives to its judgments complete generality. For
instance, the sentence `The sun rises every morning' means that we know no exception to this
rule in the past and that we expect it to hold in future. But we can imagine exceptions to the rule.
If a judgment is stated with complete generality, therefore, if it is impossible to imagine any
exception, it must be `a priori.' An analytic judgment is always `a priori'; even if a child learns
arithmetic from playing with marbles, he need not later go back to experience to know that `two
and two are four.' Empirical knowledge, on the other hand, is synthetic.
But are synthetic judgments a priori possible? Kant tries to prove this by giving examples in
which the above criteria seem to be fulfilled. Space and time are, he says, a priori forms of pure
intuition. In the case of space he gives the following metaphysical arguments:
1. Space is not an empirical concept, abstracted from other experiences, for space is presupposed in
referring sensations to something external,
48
and external experience is only possible through the presentation of space.
2.Space is a necessary presentation a priori, which underlies all external perceptions; for we cannot
imagine that there should be no space, although we can imagine that there should be nothing in
space.
3.Space is not a discursive or general concept of the relations of things in general, for there is only
one space, of which what we call `
spaces' are parts, not instances.
4.Space is presented as an infinite given magnitude, which holds within itself all the parts of space;
this relation is different from that of a concept to its instances, and therefore space is not a concept but
a form of intuition.
These arguments shall not be discussed here. They are mentioned merely as examples for the
general type of proof that Kant has in mind for the synthetic judgments a priori.
With regard to physics Kant took as a priori, besides space and time, the law of causality and the
concept of substance. In a later stage of his work he tried to include the law of conservation of
matter, the equality of `actio and reactio' and even the law of gravitation. No physicist would be
willing to follow Kant here, if the term `a priori' is used in the absolute sense that was given to it by
Kant. In mathematics Kant took Euclidean geometry as `a priori.'
Before we compare these doctrines of Kant with the results of modern physics we must mention 
another part of his work, to which we will have to refer later. The disagreeable question whether
`
the things really exist,' which had given rise to empiristic philosophy, occurred also in Kant'
s
system. But Kant has not followed the line of Berkeley and Hume, though that would have been
logically consistent. He kept the notion of the `
thing-in-itself' as different from the percept, and in
this way kept some connection with realism.
Coming now to the comparison of Kant's doctrines with modern physics, it looks in the first
moment as though his central concept of the `
synthetic judgments a priori' had been completely
annihilated by the discoveries of our century. The theory of relativity has changed our views on
space and time, it has in fact revealed entirely new
49
features of space and time, of which nothing is seen in Kant's a priori forms of pure intuition. The
law of causality is no longer applied in quantum theory and the law of conservation of matter is
no longer true for the elementary particles. Obviously Kant could not have foreseen the new
discoveries, but since he was convinced that his concepts would be `
the basis of any future
metaphysics that can be called science'
 it is interesting to see where his arguments have been
wrong.
As example we take the law of causality. Kant says that whenever we observe an event we
assume that there is a foregoing event from which the other event must follow according to
some rule. This is, as Kant states, the basis of all scientific work. In this discussion it is not
important whether or not we can always find the foregoing event from which the other one
followed. Actually we can find it in many cases. But even if we cannot, nothing can prevent us
from asking what this foregoing event might have been and to look for it. Therefore, the law of
causality is reduced to the method of scientific research; it is the condition which makes science
possible. Since we actually apply this method, the law of causality is `a priori'
 and is not derived
from experience.
Is this true in atomic physics? Let us consider a radium atom, which can emit an a-particle. The
time for the emission of the a-particle cannot be predicted. We can only say that in the average
the emission will take place in about two thousand years. Therefore, when we observe the
emission we do not actually look for a foregoing event from which the emission must according
to a rule follow. Logically it would be quite possible to look for such a foregoing event, and we
need not be discouraged by the fact that hitherto none has been found. But why has the scientific
method actually changed in this very fundamental question since Kant?
Two possible answers can be given to that question. The one is: We have been convinced by
experience that the laws of quantum theory are correct and, if they are, we know that a
foregoing event as cause for the emission at a given time cannot be found. The other answer is:
We know the foregoing event, but not quite accurately. We know the forces in the atomic
nucleus that are responsible for the emission
50
of the a-particle. But this knowledge contains the uncertainty which is brought about by the
interaction between the nucleus and the rest of the world. If we wanted to know why the aparticle was emitted at that particular time we would have to know the microscopic structure of
the whole world including ourselves, and that is impossible. There-fore, Kant's arguments for the
a priori character of the law of causality no longer apply.
A similar discussion could be given on the a priori character of space and time as forms of
intuition. The result would be the same. The a priori concepts which Kant considered an
undisputable truth are no longer contained in the scientific system of modern physics.
Still they form an essential part of this system in a somewhat different sense. In the discussion 
of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory it has been emphasized that we use the
classical concepts in describing our experimental equipment and more generally in describing that
part of the world which does not belong to the object of the experiment. The use of these
concepts, including space, time and causality, is in fact the condition for observing atomic events
and is, in this sense of the word, `a priori.' What Kant had not foreseen was that these a priori
concepts can be the conditions for science and at the same time can have only a limited range of
applicability. When we make an experiment we have to assume a causal chain of events that
leads from the atomic event through the apparatus finally to the eye of the observer; if this
causal chain was not assumed, nothing could be known about the atomic event. Still we must
keep in mind that classical physics and causality have only a limited range of applicability. It was
the fundamental paradox of quantum theory that could not be foreseen by Kant. Modern physics
has changed Kant'
s statement about the possibility of synthetic judgments a priori from a
metaphysical one into a practical one. The synthetic judgments a priori thereby have the
character of a relative truth.
If one reinterprets the Kantian `a priori' in this way, there is no reason to consider the
perceptions rather than the things as given. Just as in classical physics, we can speak about
those events that are not observed in the same manner as about those that are observed.
Therefore, practical realism is a natural part of the reinterpretation.
51
Considering the Kantian `thing-in-itself'
 Kant had pointed out that we cannot conclude anything
from the perception about the `thing-in-itself.' This statement has, as Weizsacker has noticed, its
formal analogy in the fact that in spite of the use of the classical concepts in all the experiments
a nonclassical behavior of the atomic objects is possible. The `thing-in-itself' is for the atomic
physicist, if he uses this concept at all, finally a mathematical structure; but this structure is –
contrary to Kant – indirectly deduced from experience.
In this reinterpretation the Kantian `a priori
'
 is indirectly connected with experience in so far as
it has been formed through the development of the human mind in a very distant past.
Following this argument the biologist Lorentz has once compared the `a priori' concepts with
forms of behavior that in animals are called `inherited or innate schemes.
'
 It is in fact quite
plausible that for certain primitive animals space and time are different from what Kant calls our
`pure intuition' of space and time. The latter may belong to the species `man,' but not to the
world as independent of men. But we are perhaps entering into too hypothetical discussions by
following this biological comment on the `a priori.' It was mentioned here merely as an example
of how the term `
relative truth' in connection with the Kantian `a priori'
 can possibly be
interpreted.
Modern physics has been used here as an example or, we may say, as model to check the
results of some important philosophic systems of the past, which of course were meant to hold
in a much wider field. What we have learned especially from the discussion of the philosophies
of Descartes and Kant may perhaps be stated in the following way:
Any concepts or words which have been formed in the past through the interplay between the
world and ourselves are not really sharply defined with respect to their meaning; that is to say,
we do not know exactly how far they will help us in finding our way in the world. We often know
that they can be applied to a wide range of inner or outer experience, but we practically never
know precisely the limits of their applicability. This is true even of the simplest and most general
concepts like `existence
'
 and `space and time.' Therefore, it will never be possible by pure reason
to arrive at some absolute truth.
52
The concepts may, however, be sharply defined with regard to their connections. This is actually
the fact when the concepts become a part of a system of axioms and definitions which can be
expressed consistently by a mathematical scheme. Such a group of connected concepts may be
applicable to a wide field of experience and will help us to find our way in this field. But the limits
of the applicability will in general not be known, at least not completely.
Even if we realize that the meaning of a concept is never defined with absolute precision,
some concepts form an integral part of scientific methods, since they represent for the time
being the final result of the development of human thought in the past, even in a very remote
past; they may even be inherited and are in any case the indispensable tools for doing scientific
work in our time. In this sense they can be practically a priori. But further limitations of their
applicability may be found in the future.

The Relation of Quantum Theory to Other Parts of Natural Science
It has been stated before that the concepts of natural science can sometimes be sharply defined
with regard to their connections. This possibility was realized for the first time in Newton's
Principia and it is just for that reason that Newton's work has exerted its enormous influence on
the whole development of natural science in the following centuries. Newton begins his Principia
with a group of definitions and axioms which are interconnected in such a way that they form
what one may call a `closed system.' Each concept can be represented by a mathematical
symbol, and the connections between the different concepts are then represented by
mathematical equations expressed by means of the symbols. The mathematical image of the
system ensures that contradictions cannot occur in the system. In this way the possible motions
of bodies under the influence of the acting forces are represented by the possible solutions of the
equations. The system of definitions and axioms which can be written in a set of mathematical
equations is considered as describing an eternal structure of nature, depending neither on a 
particular space nor on particular time.
The connection between the different concepts in the system is so close that one could
generally not change any one of the concepts without destroying the whole system.
For this reason Newton's system was for a long time considered as final and the task set
before the scientists of the following period seemed simply to be an expansion of Newton's
mechanics into wider fields of experience. Actually physics did develop along these lines for about
two centuries.
From the theory of the motion of mass points one could go over
54
to the mechanics of solid bodies, to rotatory motions, and one could treat the continuous
motions of a fluid or the vibrating motions of an elastic body. All these parts of mechanics or
dynamics were gradually developed in close connection with the evolution of mathematics,
especially of the differential calculus, and the results were checked by experiments. Acoustics and
hydrodynamics became a part of mechanics. Another science, in which the application of
Newton'
s mechanics was obvious, was astronomy. The improvements of the mathematical
methods gradually led to more and more accurate determinations of the motions of the planets
and of their mutual interactions. When the phenomena of electricity and magnetism were
discovered, the electric or magnetic forces were compared to the gravitational forces and their
actions upon the motion of the bodies could again be studied along the lines of Newtonian
mechanics. Finally, in the nineteenth century, even the theory of heat could be reduced to
mechanics by the assumption that heat really consists of a complicated statistical motion of the
smallest parts of matter. By combining the concepts of the mathematical theory of probability
with the concepts of Newtonian mechanics Clausius, Gibbs and Boltzmann were able to show that
the fundamental laws in the theory of heat could be interpreted as statistical laws following from
Newton's mechanics when applied to very complicated mechanical systems.
Up to this point the program set up by Newtonian mechanics had been carried out quite
consistently and had led to the understanding of a wide field of experience. The first difficulty
arose in the discussions on the electromagnetic field in the work of Faraday and Maxwell. In
Newtonian mechanics the gravitational force had been considered as given, not as an object for
further theoretical studies. In the work of Faraday and Maxwell, however, the field of force itself
became the object of the investigation; the physicists wanted to know how this field of force
varied as function of space and time. Therefore, they tried to set up equations of motion for the
fields, not primarily for the bodies upon which the fields act. This change led back to a point of
view which had been held by many scientists before Newton. An action could, so it seemed, be
transferred from one body to another only when the two bodies touched each other; for
instance, in a
55
collision or through friction. Newton had introduced a very new and strange hypothesis by
assuming a force that acted over a long distance. Now in the theory of the fields of force one
could come back to the older idea, that action is transferred from one point to a neighboring
point, only by describing the behavior of the fields in terms of differential equations. This proved
actually to be possible, and there-fore the description of the electromagnetic fields as given by
Maxwell's equations seemed a satisfactory solution of the problem of force. Here one had really
changed the program given by Newtonian mechanics. The axioms and definitions of Newton had
referred to bodies and their motion; but with Maxwell the fields of force seemed to have
acquired the same degree of reality as the bodies in Newton
'
s theory. This view of course was not
easily accepted; and to avoid such a change in the concept of reality it seemed plausible to 
compare the electromagnetic fields with the fields of elastic deformation or stress, the light waves
of Maxwell's theory with the sound waves in elastic bodies. Therefore, many physicists believed
that Maxwell's equations actually referred to the deformations of an elastic medium, which they
called the ether; and this name was given merely to explain that the medium was so light and
thin that it could penetrate into other matter and could not be seen or felt. This explanation was
not too satisfactory, however, since it could not explain the complete absence of any longitudinal
light waves.
Finally the theory of relativity, which will be discussed in the next chapter, showed in a
conclusive way that the concept of the ether as a substance, to which Maxwell's equations refer,
had to be abandoned. The arguments cannot be discussed at this point; but the result was that
the fields had to be considered as an independent reality.
A further and still more startling result of the theory of special relativity was the discovery of
new properties of space and time, actually of a relation between space and time that had not
been known before and did not exist in Newtonian mechanics.
Under the impression of this completely new situation many physicists came to the following
somewhat rash conclusion: Newtonian mechanics had finally been disproved. The primary reality
is the field and not the body, and the structure of space and time is correctly
56
described by the formulas of Lorentz and Einstein, and not by the axioms of Newton. The
mechanics of Newton was a good approximation in many cases, but now it must be improved to
give a more rigorous description of nature.
From the point of view which we have finally reached in quantum theory such a statement
would appear as a very poor description of the actual situation. First, it ignores the fact that most
experiments by which fields are measured are based upon Newtonian mechanics and, second,
that Newtonian mechanics cannot be improved; it can only be replaced by something essentially
different!
The development of quantum theory has taught us that one should rather describe the
situation in the following terms: Wherever the concepts of Newtonian mechanics can be used to
describe events in nature, the laws formulated by Newton are strictly correct and cannot be
improved. But the electromagnetic phenomena cannot adequately be described by the concepts
of Newtonian mechanics. Therefore, the experiments on the electromagnetic fields and on light
waves, together with their theoretical analysis by Maxwell, Lorentz and Einstein, have led to a new
closed system of definitions and axioms and of concepts that can be represented by mathematical
symbols, which is coherent in the same sense as the system of Newton
'
s mechanics, but is
essentially different from it.
Therefore, even the hopes which had accompanied the work of the scientists since Newton had
to be changed. Apparently progress in science could not always be achieved by using the known
laws of nature for explaining new phenomena. In some cases new phenomena that had been
observed could only be understood by new concepts which were adapted to the new
phenomena in the same way as Newton's concepts were to the mechanical events. These new
concepts again could be connected in a closed system and represented by mathematical
symbols. But if physics or, more generally, natural science proceeded in this way, the question
arose: What is the relation between the different sets of concepts? If, for instance, the same
concepts or words occur in two different sets and are defined differently with regard to their
connection and mathematical representation, in what sense do the concepts represent reality?
57
This problem arose at once when the theory of special relativity had been discovered. The 
concepts of space and time belonged both to Newtonian mechanics and to the theory of relativity.
But space and time in Newtonian mechanics were independent; in the theory of relativity they
were connected by the Lorentz transformation. In this special case one could show that the
statements of the theory of relativity approached those of Newtonian mechanics within the limit in
which all velocities in the system are very small as compared with the velocity of light. From this
one could conclude that the concepts of Newtonian mechanics could not be applied to events in
which there occurred velocities comparable to the velocity of light. Thereby one had finally found
an essential limitation of Newtonian mechanics which could not be seen from the coherent set of
concepts nor from simple observations on mechanical systems.
Therefore, the relation between two different coherent sets of concepts always requires very
careful investigation. Before we enter into a general discussion about the structure of any such
closed and coherent set of concepts and about their possible relations we will give a brief
description of those sets of concepts that have so far been defined in physics. One can distinguish
four systems that have already attained their final form.
The first set, Newtonian mechanics, has already been discussed. It is suited for the description
of all mechanical systems, of the motion of fluids and the elastic vibration of bodies; it comprises
acoustics, statics, aerodynamics.
The second closed system of concepts was formed in the course of the nineteenth century in
connection with the theory of heat. Though the theory of heat could finally be connected with
mechanics through the development of statistical mechanics, it would not be realistic to consider
it as a part of mechanics. Actually the phenomenological theory of heat uses a number of
concepts that have no counterpart in other branches of physics, like: heat, specific heat, entropy,
free energy, etc. If from this phenomenological description one goes over to a statistical
interpretation, by considering heat as energy, distributed statistically among the very many
degrees of freedom due to the atomic structure of matter, then heat is no more connected with
58
mechanics than with electrodynamics or other parts of physics. The central concept of this
interpretation is the concept of probability, closely connected with the concept of entropy in the
phenomenological theory. Besides this concept the statistical theory of heat requires the concept
of energy. But any coherent set of axioms and concepts in physics will necessarily contain the
concepts of energy, momentum and angular momentum and the law that these quantities must
under certain conditions be conserved. This follows if the coherent set is intended to describe
certain features of nature that are correct at all times and everywhere; in other words, features
that do not depend on space and time or, as the mathematicians put it, that are invariant under
arbitrary translations in space and time, rotations in space and the Galileo — or Lorentz —
transformation. Therefore, the theory of heat can be combined with any of the other closed
systems of concepts.
The third closed system of concepts and axioms has its origin in the phenomena of electricity
and magnetism and has reached its final form in the first decade of the twentieth century
through the work of Lorentz, Einstein and Minkowski. It comprises electrodynamics, special
relativity, optics, magnetism, and one may include the de Broglie theory of matter waves of all
different sorts of elementary particles, but not the wave theory of Schrodinger.
Finally, the fourth coherent system is essentially the quantum theory as it has been described
in the first two chapters. Its central concept is the probability function, or the `statistical matrix,'
as the mathematicians call it. It comprises quantum and wave mechanics, the theory of atomic
spectra, chemistry, and the theory of other properties of matter like electric conductivity,
ferromagnetism, etc.
The relations between these four sets of concepts can be indicated in the following way: The
first set is contained in the third as the limiting case where the velocity of light can be considered
as infinitely big, and is contained in the fourth as the limiting case where Planck's constant of 
action can be considered as infinitely small. The first and partly the third set belong to the fourth
as a priori for the description of the experiments. The second set can be connected with any of
the other three sets without difficulty and is especially important in its connection with the fourth.
The independent existence of the third
59
and fourth sets suggests the existence of a fifth set, of which one, three, and four are limiting
cases. This fifth set will probably be found someday in connection with the theory of the
elementary particles.
We have omitted from this enumeration the set of concepts connected with the theory of
general relativity, since this set has perhaps not yet reached its final form. But it should be
emphasized that it is distinctly different from the other four sets.
After this short survey we may come back to the more general question, what one should
consider as the characteristic features of such a closed system of axioms and definitions.
Perhaps the most important feature is the possibility of finding a consistent mathematical
representation for it. This representation must guarantee that the system does not contain
contradictions. Then the system must be suited to describe a wide field of experience. The great
variety of phenomena in the field should correspond to the great number of solutions of the
equations in the mathematical representation. The limitations of the field can generally not be
derived from the concepts. The concepts are not sharply defined in their relation to nature, in
spite of the sharp definition of their possible connections. The limitations will therefore be found
from experience, from the fact that the concepts do not allow a complete description of the
observed phenomena.
After this brief analysis of the structure of present-day physics the relation between physics and
other branches of natural science may be discussed. The nearest neighbor to physics is
chemistry. Actually through quantum theory these two sciences have come to a complete union.
But a hundred years ago they were widely separated, their methods of research were quite
different, and the concepts of chemistry had at that time no counterpart in physics. Concepts like
valency, activity, solubility and volatility had a more qualitative character, and chemistry scarcely
belonged to the exact sciences. When the theory of heat had been developed by the middle of
the last century scientists started to apply it to the chemical processes, and ever since then the
scientific work in this field has been determined by the hope of reducing the laws of chemistry to
the mechanics of the atoms. It should be emphasized, however, that this was not possible within
the
6o
framework of Newtonian mechanics. In order to give a quantitative description of the laws of
chemistry one had to formulate a much wider system of concepts for atomic physics. This was
finally done in quantum theory, which has its roots just as much in chemistry as in atomic
physics. Then it was easy to see that the laws of chemistry could not be reduced to Newtonian
mechanics of atomic particles, since the chemical elements displayed in their behavior a degree
of stability completely lacking in mechanical systems. But it was not until Bohr's theory of the
atom in 1913 that this point had been clearly understood. In the final result, one may say, the
concepts of chemistry are in part complementary to the mechanical concepts. If we know that an
atom is in its lowest stationary state that determines its chemical properties we cannot at the
same time speak about the motion of the electrons in the atom.
The present relation between biology, on the one side, and physics and chemistry, on the
other, may be very similar to that between chemistry and physics a hundred years ago. The
methods of biology are different from those of physics and chemistry, and the typical biological 
concepts are of a more qualitative character than those of the exact sciences. Concepts like life,
organ, cell, function of an organ, perception have no counterpart in physics or chemistry. On the
other hand, most of the progress made in biology during the past hundred years has been
achieved through the application of chemistry and physics to the living organism, and the whole
tendency of biology in our time is to explain biological phenomena on the basis of the known
physical and chemical laws. Again the question arises, whether this hope is justified or not.
Just as in the case of chemistry, one learns from simple biological experience that the living
organisms display a degree of stability which general complicated structures consisting of many
different types of molecules could certainly not have on the basis of the physical and chemical
laws alone. Therefore, something has to be added to the laws of physics and chemistry before the
biological phenomena can be completely understood.
With regard to this question two distinctly different views have frequently been discussed in
the biological literature. The one view
61
refers to Darwin's theory of evolution in its connection with modern genetics. According to this
theory, the only concept which has to be added to those of physics and chemistry in order to
understand life is the concept of history. The enormous time interval of roughly four thousand
million years that has elapsed since the formation of the earth has given nature the possibility of
trying an almost unlimited variety of structures of groups of molecules. Among these structures
there have finally been some that could reduplicate themselves by using smaller groups from the
surrounding matter, and such structures therefore could be created in great numbers. Accidental
changes in the structures provided a still larger variety of the existing structures. Different
structures had to compete for the material drawn from the surrounding matter and in this way,
through the `survival of the fittest,
'
 the evolution of living organisms finally took place. There can
be no doubt that this theory contains a very large amount of truth, and many biologists claim
that the addition of the concepts of history and evolution to the coherent set of concepts of
physics and chemistry will be amply sufficient to account for all biological phenomena. One of the
arguments frequently used in favor of this theory emphasizes that wherever the laws of physics
and chemistry have been checked in living organisms they have always been found to be correct;
there seems definitely to be no place at which some `vital force'
 different from the forces in
physics could enter.
On the other hand, it is just this argument that has lost much of its weight through quantum
theory. Since the concepts of physics and chemistry form a closed and coherent set, namely, that
of quantum theory, it is necessary that wherever these concepts can be used to describe
phenomena the laws connected with the concepts must be valid too. Therefore, wherever one
treats living organisms as physicochemical systems, they must necessarily act as such. The only
question from which we can learn something about the adequacy of this first view is whether the
physicochemical concepts allow a complete description of the organisms. Biologists, who answer
this question in the negative, generally hold the second view, that has now to be explained.
This second view can perhaps be stated in the following terms: It is
62
very difficult to see how concepts like perception, function of an organ, affection could be a part
of the coherent set of the concepts of quantum theory combined with the concept of history. On
the other hand, these concepts are necessary for a complete description of life, even if for the
moment we exclude mankind as presenting new problems beyond biology. Therefore, it will
probably be necessary for an understanding of life to go beyond quantum theory and to construct
a new coherent set of concepts, to which physics and chemistry may belong as `
limiting cases.'
History may be an essential part of it, and concepts like perception, adaptation, affection also will 
belong to it. If this view is correct, the combination of Darwin'
s theory with physics and chemistry
would not be sufficient to explain organic life; but still it would be true that living organisms can
to a large extent be considered as physicochemical systems — as machines, as Descartes and
Laplace have put it — and would, if treated as such, also react as such, One could at the same
time assume, as Bohr has suggested, that our knowledge of a cell being alive may be
complementary to the complete knowledge of its molecular structure. Since a complete
knowledge of this structure could possibly be achieved only by operations that destroy the life of
the cell, it is logically possible that life precludes the complete determination of its underlying
physicochemical structure. Even if one holds this second view one would probably recommend
for biological research no other method than has been pursued in the past decades: attempting
to explain as much as possible on the basis of the known physicochemical laws, and describing
the behavior of organisms carefully and without theoretical prejudices.
The first of these two views is more common among modern biologists than the second; but
the experience available at present is certainly not sufficient to decide between the two views.
The preference that is given by, many biologists to the first view may be due again to the
Cartesian partition, which has penetrated so deeply into the human mind during the past
centuries. Since the `
res cogitans' was confined to men, to the `
I,' the animals could have no
soul, they belonged exclusively to the `res extensa.' Therefore, the animals can be understood,
so it is argued, on the same terms as matter in general,
63
and the laws of physics and chemistry together with the concept of history must be sufficient to
explain their behavior. It is only when the `res cogitans' is brought in that a new situation arises
which will require entirely new concepts. But the Cartesian partition is a dangerous
oversimplification and it is therefore quite possible that the second view is the correct one.
Quite apart from this question, which cannot be settled yet, we are obviously still very far from
such a coherent and closed set of concepts for the description of biological phenomena. The
degree of complication in biology is so discouraging that one can at present not imagine any set
of concepts in which the connections could be so sharply defined that a mathematical
representation could become possible.
If we go beyond biology and include psychology in the discussion, then there can scarcely be
any doubt but that the concepts of physics, chemistry, and evolution together will not be
sufficient to describe the facts. On this point the existence of quantum theory has changed our
attitude from what was believed in the nineteenth century. During that period some scientists
were inclined to think that the psychological phenomena could ultimately be explained on the basis
of physics and chemistry of the brain. From the quantum-theoretical point of view there is no
reason for such an assumption. We would, in spite of the fact that the physical events in the
brain belong to the psychic phenomena, not expect that these could be sufficient to explain them.
We would never doubt that the brain acts as a physicochemical mechanism if treated as such;
but for an understanding of psychic phenomena we would start from the fact that the human
mind enters as object and subject into the scientific process of psychology.
Looking back to the different sets of concepts that have been formed in the past or may possibly
be formed in the future in the attempt to find our way through the world by means of science, we
see that they appear to be ordered by the increasing part played by the subjective element in the
set. Classical physics can be considered as that idealization in which we speak about the world as
entirely separated from ourselves. The first three sets correspond to this idealization. Only the first
set complies entirely with the `a priori' in the philosophy of Kant.
64
In the fourth set, that of quantum theory, man as the subject of science is brought in through
the questions which are put to nature in the a priori terms of human science. Quantum theory
does not allow a completely objective description of nature. In biology it may be important for a
complete understanding that the questions are asked by the species man which itself belongs to
the genus of living organisms, in other words, that we already know what life is even before we
have defined it scientifically. But one should perhaps not enter into speculations about the
possible structure of sets of concepts that have not yet been formed.
When one compares this order with older classifications that belong to earlier stages of natural
science one sees that one has now divided the world not into different groups of objects but into
different groups of connections. In an earlier period of science one distinguished, for instance, as
different groups minerals, plants, animals, men. These objects were taken according to their
group as of different natures, made of different materials, and determined in their behavior by
different forces. Now we know that it is always the same matter, the same various chemical
compounds that may belong to any object, to minerals as well as animals or plants; also the
forces that act between the different parts of matter are ultimately the same in every kind of
object. What can be distinguished is the kind of connection which is primarily important in a
certain phenomenon. For instance, when we speak about the action of chemical forces we mean
a kind of connection which is more complicated or in any case different from that expressed in
Newtonian mechanics. The world thus appears as a complicated tissue of events, in which
connections of different kinds alternate or overlap or combine and thereby determine the texture
of the whole.
When we represent a group of connections by a closed and coherent set of concepts, axioms,
definitions and laws which in turn is rep-resented by a mathematical scheme we have in fact
isolated and idealized this group of connections with the purpose of clarification. But even if
complete clarity has been achieved in this way, it is not known how accurately the set of
concepts describes reality.
These idealizations may be called a part of the human language
65
that has been formed from the interplay between the world and ourselves, a human response to
the challenge of nature. In this respect they may be compared to the different styles of art, say of
architecture or music. A style of art can also be defined by a set of formal rules which are
applied to the material of this special art. These rules can perhaps not be represented in a strict
sense by a set of mathematical concepts and equations, but their fundamental elements are
very closely related to the essential elements of mathematics. Equality and inequality, repetition
and symmetry, certain group structures play the fundamental role both in art and in
mathematics. Usually the work of several generations is needed to develop that formal system
which later is called the style of the art, from its simple beginning to the wealth of elaborate
forms which characterize its completion. The interest of the artist is concentrated on this process
of crystallization, where the material of the art takes, through his action, the various forms that
are initiated by the first formal concepts of this style. After the completion the interest must fade
again, because the word `interest' means: to be with something, to take part in a process of
life, but this process has then come to an end. Here again the question of how far the formal
rules of the style represent that reality of life which is meant by the art cannot be decided from
the formal rules. Art is always an idealization; the ideal is different from reality — at least from
the reality of the shadows, as Plato would have put it — but idealization is necessary for
understanding.
This comparison between the different sets of concepts in natural science with different styles
of art may seem very far from the truth to those who consider the different styles of art as
rather arbitrary products of the human mind. They would argue that in natural science these
different sets of concepts represent objective reality, have been taught to us by nature, are 
therefore by no means arbitrary, and are a necessary consequence of our gradually increasing
experimental knowledge of nature. About these points most scientists would agree; but are the
different styles of art an arbitrary product of the human mind? Here again we must not be
misled by the Cartesian partition. The style arises out of the interplay between the world and
ourselves, or more specifically between the spirit of the time and the artist. The
66
spirit of a time is probably a fact as objective as any fact in natural science, and this spirit brings
out certain features of the world which are even-independent of time, are in this sense eternal.
The artist tries by his work to make these features understandable, and in this attempt he is led to
the forms of the style in which he works.
Therefore, the two processes, that of science and that of art, are not very different. Both science
and art form in the course of the centuries a human language by which we can speak about the
more remote parts of reality, and the coherent sets of concepts as well as the different styles of
art are different words or groups of words in this language.

The Theory of Relativity
Within the field of modern physics the theory of relativity has always played a very important role.
It was in this theory that the necessity for a change in the fundamental principles of physics was 
recognized for the first time. Therefore, a discussion of Those problems that had been raised and
partly solved by the theory of relativity belongs essentially to our treatment of the philosophical
implications of modern physics. In some sense it may be said that — contrary to quantum theory
— the development of the theory of relativity from the final recognition of the difficulties to their
solution has taken only a very short time. The repetition of Michelson's experiment by Morley and
Miller in 1904 was the first definite evidence for the impossibility of detecting the translational
motion of the earth by optical methods, and Einstein's decisive paper appeared less than two
years later. On the other hand, the experiment of Morley and Miller and Einstein's paper were
only the final steps in a development which had started very much earlier and which may be
summarized under the heading `electrodynamics of moving bodies.'
Obviously the electrodynamics of moving bodies had been an important field of physics and
engineering ever since electromotors had been constructed. A serious difficulty had been brought
into this subject, however, by Maxwell's discovery of the electromagnetic nature of light waves.
These waves differ in one essential property from other waves, for instance, from sound waves:
they can be propagated in what seems to be empty space. When a bell rings in a vessel that has
been evacuated, the sound does not penetrate to the outside. But light does penetrate easily
through the evacuated volume. Therefore, one assumed that light waves could be considered as
elastic waves of a
68
very light substance called ether which could be neither seen nor felt but which filled the
evacuated space as well as the space in which other matter, like air or glass, existed. The idea
that electromagnetic waves could be a reality in themselves, independent of any bodies, did at
that time not occur to the physicists. Since this hypothetical substance ether seemed to
penetrate through other matter, the question arose: What happens if the matter is set into
motion? Does the ether participate in this motion and — if this is the case — how is a light wave
propagated in the moving ether?
Experiments which are relevant to this question are difficult for the following reason: The
velocities of moving bodies are usually very small compared to the velocity of light. Therefore,
the motion of these bodies can only produce very small effects which are proportional to the ratio
of the velocity of the body to the velocity of light, or to a higher power of this ratio. Several
experiments by Wilson, Rowland, Roentgen and Eichenwald and Fizeau permitted the
measurement of such effects with an accuracy corresponding to the first power of this ratio. The
theory of the electrons developed by Lorentz in 1895 was able to describe these effects quite
satisfactorily. But then the experiment of Michelson, Morley and Miller created a new situation.
This experiment shall be discussed in some detail. In order to get bigger effects and thereby
more accurate results, it seemed best to do experiments with bodies of very high velocity. The
earth moves around the sun with a velocity of roughly 20 miles/sec. If the ether is at rest with
respect to the sun and does not move with the earth, then this fast motion of the ether with
respect to the earth should make itself felt in a change of the velocity of light. This velocity should
be different depending on whether the light is propagated in a direction parallel or perpendicular
to the direction of the motion of the ether. Even if the ether should partly move with the earth,
there should be some effect due to what one may call wind of the ether, and this effect would
then probably depend on the altitude above sea level at which the experiment is carried out. A
calculation of the expected effect showed that it should be very small, since it is proportional to
the square of the ratio of the velocity of the earth to that of the light, and that one therefore had
to carry out very careful experiments on the
69
interference of two beams of light traveling parallel or perpendicular to the motion of the earth.
The first experiment of this kind, carried out by Michelson in 1881, had not been sufficiently
accurate. But even later repetitions of the experiment did not reveal the slightest signs of the
expected effect. Especially the experiments of Morley and Miller in 1904 could be considered as
definite proof that an effect of the expected order of magnitude did not exist.
This result, strange as it was, met another point that had been discussed by the physicists
some time before. In Newton's mechanics a certain `principle of relativity' is fulfilled that can be
described in the following terms: If in a certain system of reference the mechanical motion of
bodies fulfills the laws of Newtonian mechanics, then this is also true for any other frame of
reference which is in uniform nonrotating motion with respect to the first system. Or, in other
words, a uniform translational motion of a system does not produce any mechanical effects at all
and can therefore not be observed by such effects.
Such a principle of relativity — so it seemed to the physicists — could not be true in optics or
electrodynamics. If the first system is at rest with respect to the ether, the other systems are
not, and therefore their motion with respect to the ether should be recognized by effects of the
type considered by Michelson. The negative result of the experiment of Morley and Miller in 1904
revived the idea that such a principle of relativity could be true in electrodynamics as well as
Newtonian mechanics.
On the other hand, there was an old experiment by Fizeau in 1851 that seemed definitely to
contradict the principle of relativity. Fizeau had measured the velocity of light in a moving liquid. If
the principle of relativity was correct, the total velocity of light in the moving liquid should be the
sum of the velocity of the liquid and the velocity of light in the liquid at rest. But this was not the
case; the experiment of Fizeau showed that the total velocity was somewhat smaller.
Still the negative results of all more recent experiments to recognize the motion `with respect to
the ether' inspired the theoretical physicists and mathematicians at that time to look for
mathematical interpretations that reconciled the wave equation for the propagation of
70
light with the principle of relativity. Lorentz suggested, in 1904, a mathematical transformation
that fulfilled these requirements. He had to introduce the hypothesis that moving bodies are
contracted in the direction of motion by a factor depending on the velocity of the body, and in
different schemes of reference there are different `apparent'
 times which in many ways take the
place of the `
real' time. In this way he could represent something resembling the principle of
relativity: the `apparent' velocity of light was the same in every system of reference. Similar ideas
had been discussed by Poincare, Fitzgerald and other physicists.
The decisive step, however, was taken in the paper by Einstein in 1905 in which he established
the `apparent' time of the Lorentz transformation as the `real' time and abolished what had
been called `
real' time by Lorentz. This was a change in the very foundations of physics; an
unexpected and very radical change that required all the courage of a young and revolutionary
genius. To take this step one needed, in the mathematical representation of nature, nothing
more than the consistent application of the Lorentz transformation. But by its new interpretation
the structure of space and time had changed and many problems of physics appeared in a new
light. The substance ether, for instance, could be abolished too. Since all systems of reference
that are in uniform translation motion with respect to each other are equivalent for the
description of nature, there is no meaning in the statement that there is a substance, the ether,
which is at rest in only one of these systems. Such a substance is in fact not needed and it is
much simpler to say that light waves are propagated through empty space and that
electromagnetic fields are a reality of their own and can exist in empty space.
But the decisive change was in the structure of space and time. It is very difficult to describe
this change in the words of common language, without the use of mathematics, since the
common words `space' and `time' refer to a structure of space and time that is actually an 
idealization and oversimplification of the real structure. But still we have to try to describe the
new structure and we can perhaps do it in the following way:
When we use the term `past' we comprise all those events which
71
we could know at least in principle, about which we could have heard at least in principle. In a
similar manner we comprise by the term `future' all those events which we could influence at least
in principle, which we could try to change or to prevent at least in principle. It is not easy for a
nonphysicist to see why this definition of the terms `past' and `
future'
 should be the most
convenient one. But one can easily see that it corresponds very accurately to our common use of
the terms. If we use the terms in this way, it turns out as a result of many experiments that the
content of `future' or `past' does not depend on the state of motion or other properties of the
observer. We may say that the definition is invariant against the motion of the observer. This is
true both in Newtonian mechanics and in Einstein's theory of relativity.
But the difference is this: In classical theory we assume that future and past are separated by
an infinitely short time interval which we may call the present moment. In the theory of relativity
we have learned that the situation is different: future and past are separated by a finite time
interval the length of which depends on the distance from the observer. Any action can only be
propagated by a velocity smaller than or equal to the velocity of light. Therefore, an observer can
at a given instant neither know of nor influence any event at a distant point which takes place
between two characteristic times. The one time is the instant at which a light signal has to be given
from the point of the event in order to reach the observer at the instant of observation. The other
time is the instant at which a light signal, given by the observer at the instant of the observation,
reaches the point of the event. The whole finite time interval between these two instants may be
said to belong to the `present time' for the observer at the instant of observation. Any event
taking place between the two characteristic times may be called `
simultaneous' with the act of
observation.
The use of the phrase `may be called' points up an ambiguity in the word `
simultaneous,' which
is due to the fact that this term has been formed from the experience of daily life, in which the
velocity of light can always be considered as infinitely high. Actually this term in physics can be
defined also in a slightly different manner and Einstein
72
has in his papers used this second definition. When two events happen at the same point in space
simultaneously, we say that they coincide; this term is quite unambiguous. Let us now imagine
three points in space that lie on a straight line so that the point in the middle has the same
distance from each of the two outer points. If two events happen at the two outer points at such
times that light signals starting from the events coincide when they reach the point in the middle,
we can define the two events as simultaneous. This definition is narrower than the first one. One
of its most important consequences is that when two events are simultaneous for one observer
they may not be simultaneous for another observer, if he is in motion relative to the first
observer. The connection between the two definitions can be established by the statement that
whenever two events are simultaneous in the first sense of the term, one can always find a
frame of reference in which they are simultaneous in the second sense too.
The first definition of the term `
simultaneous' seems to correspond more nearly to its use in
daily life, since the question whether two events are simultaneous does in daily life not depend
on the frame of reference. But in both relativistic definitions the term has acquired a precision
which is lacking in the language of daily life. In quantum theory the physicists had to learn rather 
early that the terms of classical physics describe nature only inaccurately, that their application is
limited by the quantum laws and that one therefore should be cautious in their use. In the theory
of relativity the physicists have tried to change the meaning of the words of classical physics, to
make the terms more precise in such a way that they fit the new situation in nature.
The structure of space and time that has been brought to light by the theory of relativity has
many consequences in different parts of physics. The electrodynamics of moving bodies can be
derived at once from the principle of relativity. This principle itself can be formulated as a quite
general law of nature pertaining not only to electrodynamics or mechanics but to any group of
laws: The laws take the same form in all systems of reference, which are different from each
other only by a uniform translational motion; they are invariant against the Lorentz
transformation.
73
Perhaps the most important consequence of the principle of relativity is the inertia of energy,
or the equivalence of mass and energy. Since the velocity of light is the limiting velocity which
can never be reached by any material body, it is easy to see that it is more difficult to accelerate
a body that is already moving very fast than a body at rest. The inertia has increased with the
kinetic energy. But quite generally any kind of energy will, according to the theory of relativity,
contribute to the inertia, i.e., to the mass, and the mass belonging to a given amount of energy
is just this energy divided by the square of the velocity of light. Therefore, every energy carries
mass with it; but even a rather big energy carries only a very small mass, and this is the reason
why the connection between mass and energy had not been observed before. The two laws of
the conservation of mass and the conservation of charge lose their separate validity and are
combined into one single law which may be called the law of conservation of energy or mass.
Fifty years ago, when the theory of relativity was formulated, this hypothesis of the equivalence
of mass and energy seemed to be a complete revolution in physics, and there was still very little
experimental evidence for it. In our times we see in many experiments how elementary particles
can be created from kinetic energy, and how such particles are annihilated to form radiation;
therefore, the transmutation from energy into mass and vice versa suggests nothing unusual.
The enormous release of energy in an atomic explosion is another and still more spectacular
proof of the correctness of Einstein'
s equation. But we may add here a critical historical remark.
It has sometimes been stated that the enormous energies of atomic explosions are due to a
direct transmutation of mass into energy, and that it is only on the basis of the theory of
relativity that one has been able to predict these energies. This is, however, a misunderstanding.
The huge amount of energy available in the atomic nucleus was known ever since the
experiments of Becquerel, Curie and Rutherford on radioactive decay. Any decaying body like
radium produces an amount of heat about a million times greater than the heat released in a
chemical process in a similar amount of material. The source of energy in the fission process of
uranium is just the same as that in the
74
a-decay of radium, namely, mainly the electrostatic repulsion of the two parts into which the
nucleus is separated. Therefore, the energy of an atomic explosion comes directly from this
source and is not derived from a transmutation of mass into energy. The number of elementary
particles with finite rest mass does not decrease during the explosion. But it is true that the
binding energies of the particles in an atomic nucleus do show up in their masses and therefore
the release of energy is in this indirect manner also connected with changes in the masses of the
nuclei. The equivalence of mass and energy has – besides its great importance in physics – also
raised problems concerning very old philosophical questions. It has been the thesis of several 
philosophical systems of the past that substance or matter cannot be destroyed. In modern
physics, however, many experiments have shown that elementary particles, e.g., positions and
electrons, can be annihilated and transmuted into radiation. Does this mean that these older
philosophical systems have been disproved by modern experience and that the arguments
brought forward by the earlier systems have been misleading?
This would certainly be a rash and unjustified conclusion, since the terms `substance' and
`matter' in ancient or medieval philosophy cannot simply be identified with the term `mass' in
modern physics. If one wished to express our modern experience in the language of older
philosophies, one could consider mass and energy as two different forms of the same `
substance'
and thereby keep the idea of substance as indestructible.
On the other hand, one can scarcely say that one gains much by expressing modern
knowledge in an old language. The philosophic systems of the past were formed from the bulk of
knowledge available at their time and from the lines of thought to which such knowledge had led.
Certainly one should not expect the philosophers of many hundreds of years ago to have
foreseen the development of modern physics or the theory of relativity. Therefore, the concepts
to which the philosophers were led in the process of intellectual clarification a long time ago
cannot possibly be adapted to phenomena that can only be observed by the elaborate technical
tools of our time.
But before going into a discussion of philosophical implications of
75
the theory of relativity its further development has to be described.
The hypothetical substance `ether,' which had played such an important role in the early
discussions on Maxwell's theories in the nineteenth century, had – as has been said before – been
abolished by the theory of relativity. This is sometimes stated by saying that the idea of absolute
space has been abandoned. But such a statement has to be accepted with great caution. It is
true that one cannot point to a special frame of reference in which the substance ether is at rest
and which could therefore deserve the name `absolute space.' But it would be wrong to say that
space has now lost all of its physical properties. The equations of motion for material bodies or
fields still take a different form in a `normal' system of reference from another one which rotates
or is in a nonuniform motion with respect to the `normal' one. The existence of centrifugal forces
in a rotating system proves – so far as the theory of relativity of 1905 and 1906 is concerned – the
existence of physical properties of space which permit the distinction between a rotating and a
nonrotating system.
This may not seem satisfactory from a philosophical point of view, from which one would prefer
to attach physical properties only to physical entities like material bodies or fields and not to empty
space. But so far as the theory of electromagnetic processes or mechanical motions is concerned,
this existence of physical properties of empty space is simply a description of facts that cannot be
disputed.
A careful analysis of this situation about ten years later, in 1916, led Einstein to a very important
extension of the theory of relativity, which is usually called the theory of `general relativity.' Before
going into a description of the main ideas of this new theory it maybe useful to say a few words
about the degree of certainty with which we can rely on the correctness of these two parts of the
theory of relativity. The theory of 1905 and 1906 is based on a very great number of wellestablished facts: on the experiments of Michelson and Morley and many similar ones, on the
equivalence of mass and energy in innumerable radioactive processes, on the dependence of the
lifetime of radioactive bodies on their velocity, etc. Therefore, this theory belongs to the firm
foundations of modern physics and cannot be disputed in our present situation.
76
For the theory of general relativity the experimental evidence is much less convincing, since
the experimental material is very scarce. There are only a few astronomical observations which
allow a checking of the correctness of the assumptions. Therefore, this whole theory is more
hypothetical than the first one.
The cornerstone of the theory of general relativity is the connection between inertia and gravity.
Very careful measurements have shown that the mass of a body as a source of gravity is exactly
proportional to the mass as a measure for the inertia of the body. Even the most accurate
measurements have never shown any deviation from this law. If the law is generally true, the
gravitational forces can be put on the same level with the centrifugal forces or with other forces
that arise as a reaction of the inertia. Since the centrifugal forces had to be considered as due to
physical properties of empty space, as had been discussed before, Einstein turned to the
hypothesis that the gravitational forces also are due to properties of empty space. This was a
very important step which necessitated at once a second step of equal importance. We know that
the forces of gravity are produced by masses. If therefore gravitation is connected with
properties of space, these properties of space must be caused or influenced by the masses. The
centrifugal forces in a rotating system must be produced by the rotation (relative to the system)
of possibly very distant masses.
In order to carry out the program outlined in these few sentences Einstein had to connect the
underlying physical ideas with the mathematical scheme of general geometry that had been
developed by Riemann. Since the properties of space seemed to change continuously with the
gravitational fields, its geometry had to be compared with the geometry on curved surfaces
where the straight line of Euclidean geometry has to be replaced by the geodetical line, the line of
shortest distance, and where the curvature changes continuously. As a final result Einstein was
able to give a mathematical formulation for the connection between the distribution of masses
and the determining parameter of the geometry. This theory did represent the common facts
about gravitation. It was in a very high approximation identical with the conventional theory of
gravitation and predicted furthermore a few interesting effects which were just at the limit of
measurability.
77
There was, for instance, the action of gravity on light. When mono-chromatic light is emitted
from a heavy star, the light quanta lose energy when moving away through the gravitational field
of the star; a red shift of the emitted spectral line follows. There is as yet no experimental
evidence for this red shift, as the discussion of the experiments by Freundlich has clearly shown.
But it would also be premature to conclude that the experiments contradict the prediction of
Einstein's theory. A beam of light that passes near the sun should be deflected by its
gravitational field. The deflection has been found experimentally by Freundlich in the right order
of magnitude; but whether the deflection agrees quantitatively with the value predicted by
Einstein's theory has not yet been decided. The best evidence for the validity of the theory of
general relativity seems to be the procession in the orbital motion of the planet Mercury, which
apparently is in very good agreement with the value predicted by the theory.
Though the experimental basis of general relativity is still rather narrow, the theory contains
ideas of the greatest importance. During the whole period from the mathematicians of ancient
Greece to the nineteenth century, Euclidean geometry had been considered as evident; the
axioms of Euclid were regarded as the foundation of any mathematical geometry, a foundation
that could not be disputed. Then, in the nineteenth century, the mathematicians Bolyai and
Lobachevsky, Gauss and Riemann found that other geometries could be invented which could be
developed with the same mathematical precision as that of Euclid; therefore, the questions as to
which geometry was correct turned out to be an empirical one. But it was only through the work 
of Einstein that the question could really be taken up by the physicists. The geometry discussed
in the theory of general relativity was not concerned with three-dimensional space only but with
the four-dimensional manifold consisting of space and time. The theory established a connection
between the geometry in this manifold and the distribution of masses in the world. Therefore,
this theory raised in an entirely new form the old questions of the behavior of space and time in
the largest dimensions; it could suggest possible answers that could be checked by observations.
Consequently, very old philosophic problems were taken up that
78
had occupied the mind of man since the earliest phases of philosophy and science. Is space finite
or infinite? What was there before the beginning of time? What will happen at the end of time?
Or is there no beginning and no end? These questions had found different answers in different
philosophies and religions. In the philosophy of Aristotle, for instance, the total space of the
universe was finite (though it was infinitely divisible). Space was due to the extension of bodies, it
was connected with the bodies; there was no space where there were no bodies. The universe
consisted of the earth and the sun and the stars: a finite number of bodies. Beyond the sphere of
the stars there was no space; therefore, the space of the universe was finite.
In the philosophy of Kant this question belonged to what he called `antinomies' — questions
that cannot be answered, since two different arguments lead to opposite results. Space cannot be
finite, since we cannot imagine that there should be an end to space; to whichever point in space
we come we can always imagine that we can go beyond. At the same time space cannot be
infinite, because space is something that we can imagine (else the word `space' would not have
been formed) and we cannot imagine an infinite space. For this second thesis the argument of
Kant has not been verbally reproduced. The sentence `
space is infinite' means for us something
negative; we cannot come to an end of space. For Kant it means that the infinity of space is really
given, that it `exists
'
 in a sense that we can scarcely reproduce. Kant'
s result is that a rational
answer to the question whether space is finite or infinite cannot be given because the whole
universe cannot be the object of our experience.
A similar situation is found with respect to the problem of the infinity of time. In the
Confessions of St Augustine, for instance, this question takes the form: What was God doing
before He created the world? Augustine is not satisfied with the joke: `God was busy preparing
Hell for those who ask foolish questions.'
 This, he says, would be too cheap an answer, and he
tries to give a rational analysis of the problem. Only for us is time passing by; it is expected by us
as future; it passes by as the present moment and is remembered by us as past. But God is not
in time; a thousand years are for Him as one day, and one day as a thousand years. Time has
been created together with the
79
world, it belongs to the world, therefore time did not exist before the universe existed. For God
the whole course of the universe is given at once. There was no time before He created the world.
It is obvious that in such statements the word `created' at once raises all the essential difficulties.
This word as it is usually understood means that something has come into being that has not been
before, and in this sense it presupposes the concept of time. Therefore, it is impossible to define
in rational terms what could be meant by the phrase `
time has been created.' This fact reminds
us again of the often discussed lesson that has been learned from modern physics: that every
word or concept, clear as it may seem to be, has only a limited range of applicability.
In the theory of general relativity these questions about the infinity of space and time can be
asked and partly answered on an empirical basis. If the connection between the four-dimensional
geometry in space and time and the distribution of masses in the universe has been correctly 
given by the theory, then the astronomical observations on the distribution of galaxies in space
give us information about the geometry of the universe as a whole. At least one can build
`models' of the universe, cosmological pictures, the consequences of which can be compared with
the empirical facts.
From the present astronomical knowledge one cannot definitely distinguish between several
possible models. It may be that the space filled by the universe is finite. This would not mean that
there is an end of the universe at some place. It would only mean that by proceeding farther and
farther in one direction in the universe one would finally come back to the point from which one
had started. The situation would be similar as in the two-dimensional geometry on the surface of
the earth where we, when starting from a point in an eastward direction, finally come back to
this point from the west.
With respect to time there seems to be something like a beginning. Many observations point to
an origin of the universe about four billion years ago; at least they seem to show that at that time
all matter of the universe was concentrated in a much smaller space than it is now and has
expanded ever since from this small space with different velocities. The same time of four billion
years is found in many different observations (e.g., from the age of meteorites, of minerals
8o
on the earth, etc.), and therefore it would be difficult to find an interpretation essentially
different from this idea of an origin. If it is the correct one it would mean that beyond this time
the concept of time would undergo essential changes. In the present state of astronomical
observations the questions about the space-time geometry on a large scale cannot yet be
answered with any degree of certainty. But it is extremely interesting to see that these questions
may possibly be answered eventually on a solid empirical basis. For the time being even the
theory of general relativity rests on a very narrow experimental foundation and must be
considered as much less certain than the so-called theory of special relativity expressed by the
Lorentz transformation.
Even if one limits the further discussions of this latter theory there is no doubt that the theory of
relativity has deeply changed our views on the structure of space and time. The most exciting
aspect of these changes is perhaps not their special nature but the fact that they have been
possible. The structure of space and time which had been defined by Newton as the basis of his
mathematical description of nature was simple and consistent and corresponded very closely to
the use of the concepts space and time in daily life. This correspondence was in fact so close that
Newton'
s definitions could be considered as the precise mathematical formulation of these
common concepts. Before the theory of relativity it seemed completely obvious that events could
be ordered in time independent of their location in space. We know now that this impression is
created in daily life by the fact that the velocity of light is so very much higher than any other
velocity occurring in practical experience; but this restriction was of course not realized at that
time. And even if we know the restriction now we can scarcely imagine that the time order of
events should depend on their location.
The philosophy of Kant later on drew attention to the fact that the concepts of space and time
belong to our relation to nature, not to nature itself; that we could not describe nature without
using these concepts. Consequently, these concepts are `a priori'
 in some sense, they are the
condition for and not primarily the result of experience, and it was generally believed that they
could not be touched by new experience. Therefore, the necessity of the change appeared as a
great
81
surprise. It was the first time that the scientists learned how cautious they had to be in applying
the concepts of daily life to the refined experience of modern experimental science. Even the 
precise and consistent formulation of these concepts in the mathematical language of Newton'
s
mechanics or their careful analysis in the philosophy of Kant had offered no protection against
the critical analysis possible through extremely accurate measurements. This warning later proved
extremely useful in the development of modern physics, and it would certainly have been still more
difficult to understand quantum theory had not the success of the theory of relativity warned the

Criticism and Counterproposals to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum
Theory
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory has led the physicists far away from the simple
materialistic views that prevailed in the natural science of the nineteenth century. Since these
views had not only been intrinsically connected with natural science of that period but had also
found a systematic analysis in some philosophic systems and had penetrated deeply into the
mind even of the common men on the street, it can be well understood that many attempts have
been made to criticize the Copenhagen interpretation and to replace it by one more in line with
the concepts of classical physics or materialistic philosophy.
These attempts can be divided into three different groups. The first group does not want to
change the Copenhagen interpretation so far as predictions of experimental results are
concerned; but it tries to change the language of this interpretation in order to get a closer
resemblance to classical physics. In other words, it tries to change the philosophy without
changing the physics. Some papers of this first group restrict their agreement with the
experimental predictions of the Copenhagen interpretation to all those experiments that have
hitherto been carried out or that belong to normal electronic physics.
The second group realizes that the Copenhagen interpretation is the only adequate one, if the
experimental results agree everywhere with the predictions of this interpretation. Therefore, the
papers of this group try to change quantum theory to some extent in certain critical points.
The third group, finally, expresses rather its general dissatisfaction with the results of the
Copenhagen interpretation and especially with its philosophical conclusions, without making
definite counter83
proposals. Papers by Einstein, von Laue and Schrodinger belong to this third group which has
historically been the first of the three groups.
However, all the opponents of the Copenhagen interpretation do agree on one point. It would,
in their view, be desirable to return to the reality concept of classical physics or, to use a more
general philosophic term, to the ontology of materialism. They would prefer to come back to the
idea of an objective real world whose smallest parts exist objectively in the same sense as stones
or trees exist, independently of whether or not we observe them.
This, however, is impossible or at least not entirely possible because of the nature of the atomic
phenomena, as has been discussed in some of the earlier chapters. It cannot be our task to
formulate wishes as to how the atomic phenomena should be; our task can only be to
understand them.
When one analyzes the papers of the first group, it is important to realize from the beginning
that their interpretations cannot be refuted by experiment, since they only repeat the
Copenhagen interpretation in a different language. From a strictly positivistic standpoint one may
even say that we are here concerned not with counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation
but with its exact repetition in a different language. Therefore, one can only dispute the
suitability of this language. One group of counterproposals works with the idea of `hidden
parameters.' Since the quantum-theoretical laws determine in general the results of an
experiment only statistically, one would from the classical standpoint be inclined to think that
there exist some hidden parameters which escape observation in any ordinary experiment but
which determine the outcome of the experiment in the normal causal way. Therefore, some
papers try to construct such parameters within the framework of quantum mechanics.
Along this line, for instance, Bohm has made a counter-proposal to the Copenhagen
interpretation, which has recently been taken up to some extent also by de Broglie. Bohm's
interpretation has been worked out in detail. It may therefore serve here as a basis for the
discussions. Bohm considers the particles as `objectively real' structures, like the point masses in
Newtonian mechanics. The waves
84
in configuration space are in his interpretation `objectively real' too, like electric fields.
Configuration space is a space of many dimensions referring to the different co-ordinates of all the
particles belonging to the system. Here we meet a first difficulty: what does it mean to call
waves in configuration space `real'? This space is a very abstract space. The word `real' goes back
to the Latin word `res,' which means `
thing'; but things are in the ordinary three-dimensional
space, not in an abstract configuration space. One may call the waves in configuration space
`objective' when one wants to say that these waves do not depend on any observer; but one
can scarcely call them `real' unless one is willing to change the meaning of the word. Bohm
goes on defining the lines perpendicular to the surfaces of constant wave-phase as the possible
orbits of the particles. Which of these lines is the `real' orbit depends, according to him, on the
history of the system and the measuring apparatus and cannot be decided without knowing more
about the system and the measuring equipment than actually can be known. This history
contains in fact the hidden parameters, the `actual orbit' before the experiment started.
One consequence of this interpretation is, as Pauli has emphasized, that the electrons in the
ground states of many atoms should be at rest, not performing any orbital motion around the
atomic nucleus. This looks like a contradiction of the experiments, since measurements of the
velocity of the electrons in the ground state (for instance, by means of the Compton effect) reveal
always a velocity distribution in the ground state, which is – in conformity with the rules of
quantum mechanics – given by the square of the wave function in momentum or velocity space.
But here Bohm can argue that the measurement can no longer be evaluated by the ordinary
laws. He agrees that the normal evaluation of the measurement would indeed lead to a velocity
distribution; but when the quantum theory for the measuring equipment is taken into account –
especially some strange quantum potentials introduced ad hoc by Bohm – then the statement is
admissible that the electrons `
really'
 always are at rest. In measurements of the position of the
particle, Bohm takes the ordinary interpretation of the experiments as correct; in measurements
of the velocity he rejects it. At this price Bohm considers himself able to assert: `We do not
85
need to abandon the precise, rational and objective description of individual systems in the realm
of quantum theory.' This objective description, however, reveals itself as a kind of `
ideological
superstructure,'
 which has little to do with immediate physical reality; for the hidden parameters
of Bohm's interpretation are of such a kind that they can never occur in the description of real
processes, if quantum theory remains unchanged.
In order to escape this difficulty, Bohm does in fact express the hope that in future
experiments in the range of the elementary particles the hidden parameters may yet play a
physical part, and that quantum theory may thus be proved false. When such strange hopes
were expressed, Bohr used to say that they were similar in structure to the sentence: `We may
hope that it will later turn out that sometimes 2 X 2 = 5, for this would be of great advantage for
our finances.' Actually the fulfillment of Bohm's hopes would cut the ground from beneath not
only quantum theory but also Bohm's interpretation. Of course it must at the same time be
emphasized that the analogy just mentioned, although complete, does not represent a logically
compelling argument against a possible future alteration of quantum theory in the manner
suggested by Bohm. For it would not be fundamentally unimaginable that, for example, a future
extension of mathematical logic might give a certain meaning to the statement that in exceptional
cases 2 X 2 = 5, and it might even be possible that this extended mathematics would be of use
in calculations in the field of economics. We are nevertheless actually convinced, even without
cogent logical grounds, that such changes in mathematics would be of no help to us financially.
Therefore, it is very difficult to understand how the mathematical proposals which the work of
Bohm indicates as a possible realization of his hopes could be used for the description of physical
phenomena.
If we disregard this possible alteration of quantum theory, then Bohm's language, as we have
already pointed out, says nothing about physics that is different from what the Copenhagen
interpretation says. There then remains only the question of the suitability of this language.
Besides the objection already made that in speaking of particle orbits we are concerned with a
superfluous `ideological
86
superstructure,' it must be particularly mentioned here that Bohm's language destroys the
symmetry between position and velocity which is implicit in quantum theory; for the
measurements of position Bohm accepts the usual interpretation, for the measurements of
velocity or momentum he rejects it. Since the symmetry properties always constitute the most
essential features of a theory, it is difficult to see what would be gained by omitting them in the 
corresponding language. Therefore, one cannot consider Bohm'
s counterproposal to the
Copenhagen interpretation as an improvement.
A similar objection can be raised in a somewhat different form against the statistical
interpretations put forward by Bopp and (on a slightly different line) by Fenyes. Bopp considers
the creation or the annihilation of a particle as the fundamental process of quantum theory, the
particle is `real' in the classical sense of the word, in the sense of materialistic ontology, and the
laws of quantum theory are considered as a special case of correlation statistics for such events of
creation and annihilation. This interpretation, which contains many interesting comments on the
mathematical laws of quantum theory, can be carried out in such a manner that it leads, as
regards the physical consequences, to exactly the same conclusions as the Copenhagen
interpretation. So far it is, in the positivistic sense, isomorphic with it, as is Bohm's. But in its
language it destroys the symmetry between particles and waves that otherwise is a characteristic
feature of the mathematical scheme of quantum theory. As early as 1928 it was shown by
Jordan, Klein and Wigner that the mathematical scheme can be interpreted not only as a
quantization of particle motion but also as a quantization of three-dimensional matter waves;
therefore, there is no reason to consider these matter waves as less real than the particles. The
symmetry between waves and particles could be ensured in Bopp's interpretation only if the
corresponding correlation statistics were developed for matter waves in space and time as well,
and if the question was left open whether particles or waves are to be considered as the `actual'
reality.
The assumption that particles are real in the sense of the materialistic ontology will always
lead to the temptation to consider deviations from the uncertainty principle as `basically'
possible. Fenyes, for
87
instance, says that `the existence of the uncertainty principle [which he connects with certain
statistical relations] by no means renders impossible the simultaneous measurement, with
arbitrary accuracy, of position and velocity.' Fenyes does not, however, state how such
measurements should be carried out in practice, and therefore his considerations seem to
remain abstract mathematics.
Weizel, whose counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation are akin to those of Bohm
and Fenyes, relates the `hidden parameters' to a new kind of particle introduced ad hoc, the
`
zeron,'
 which is not otherwise observable. However, such a concept runs into the danger that
the interaction between the real particles and the zerons dissipates the energy among the many
degrees of freedom of the zeron field, so that the whole of thermodynamics becomes a chaos.
Weizel has not explained how he hopes to avoid this danger.
The standpoint of the entire group of publications mentioned so far can perhaps best be
defined by recalling a similar discussion of the theory of special relativity. Anyone who was
dissatisfied with Einstein's negation of the ether, of absolute space and of absolute time could
then argue as follows: The non-existence of absolute space and absolute time is by no means
proved by the theory of special relativity. It has been shown only that true space and true time
do not occur directly in any ordinary experiment; but if this aspect of the laws of nature has
been correctly taken into account, and thus the correct `apparent' times have been introduced
for moving co-ordinate systems, there would be no arguments against the assumption of an
absolute space. It would even be plausible to assume that the center of gravity of our galaxy is
(at least approximately) at rest in absolute space. The critic of the special theory of relativity
might add that we may hope that future measurements will allow the unambiguous definition of
absolute space (that is, of the `hidden parameter' of the theory of relativity) and that the theory
of relativity will thus be refuted.
It is seen at once that this argument cannot be refuted by experiment, since it as yet makes
no assertions which differ from those of the theory of special relativity. But such an 
interpretation would destroy in the language used the decisive symmetry property of the
88
theory, namely, the Lorentz invariance, and it must therefore be considered inappropriate.
The analogy to quantum theory is obvious. The laws of quantum theory are such that the
`hidden parameters,' invented ad hoc, can never be observed. The decisive symmetry properties
are thus destroyed if we introduce the hidden parameters as a fictitious entity into the
interpretation of the theory.
The work of Blochinzev and Alexandrov is quite different in its statement of the problem from
those discussed before. These authors expressly and from the beginning restrict their objections
against the Copenhagen interpretation to the philosophical side of the problem. The physics of
this interpretation is accepted unreservedly.
The external form of the polemic, however, is so much the sharper: `Among the different
idealistic trends in contemporary physics the so-called Copenhagen school is the most
reactionary. The present article is devoted to the unmasking of the idealistic and agnostic
speculations of this school on the basic problems of quantum physics,' writes Blochinzev in his
introduction. The acerbity of the polemic shows that here we have to do not with science alone
but with a confession of faith, with adherence to a certain creed. The aim is expressed at the
end with a quotation from the work of Lenin: `However marvellous, from the point of view of the
common human intellect, the transformation of the unweighable ether into weighable material,
however strange the electrons lack of any but electromagnetic mass, however unusual the
restriction of the mechanical laws of motion to but one realm of natural phenomena and their
subordination to the deeper laws of electromagnetic phenomena, and so on – all this is but
another confirmation of dialectic materialism.' This latter statement seems to make Blochinzev'
s
discussion about the relation of quantum theory to the philosophy of dialectic materialism less
interesting in so far as it seems to degrade it to a staged trial i h which the verdict is known
before the trial has begun. Still it is important to get complete clarity about the arguments
brought for-ward by Blochinzev and Alexandrov.
Here, where the task is to rescue materialistic ontology, the attack is chiefly made against the
introduction of the observer into the
89
interpretation of quantum theory. Alexandrov writes: `We must there-fore understand by "
result
of measurement"
 in quantum theory only the objective effect of the interaction of the electron
with a suitable object. Mention of the observer must be avoided, and we must treat objective
conditions and objective effects. A physical quantity is an objective characteristic of the
phenomenon, but not the result of an observation.'
 According to Alexandrov, the wave function in
con-figuration space characterizes the objective state of the electron.
In his presentation Alexandrov overlooks the fact that the formal-ism of quantum theory does
not allow the same degree of objectivation as that of classical physics. For instance, if the
interaction of a system with the measuring apparatus is treated as a whole according to quantum
mechanics and if both are regarded as cut off from the rest of the world, then the formalism of
quantum theory does not as a rule lead to a definite result; it will not lead, e.g., to the
blackening of the photographic plate at a given point. If one tries to rescue Alexandrov's
`objective effect' by saying that `in reality'
 the plate is blackened at a given point after the
interaction, the rejoinder is that the quantum mechanical treatment of the closed system
consisting of electron, measuring apparatus and plate is no longer being applied. It is the `
factual'
character of an event describable in terms of the concepts of daily life which is not without further
comment contained in the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, and which appears in the 
Copenhagen interpretation by the introduction of the observer. Of course the introduction of the
observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be
brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering
decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an
apparatus or a human being; but the registration, i.e., the transition from the `possible' to the
`actual,'
 is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum
theory. At this point quantum theory is intrinsically connected with thermodynamics in so far as
every act of observation is by its very nature an irreversible process; it is only through such
irreversible processes that the formalism of quantum theory can be consistently connected with
actual events in space and
90
time. Again the irreversibility is – when projected into the mathematical representation of the
phenomena – a consequence of the observer'
s incomplete knowledge of the system and in so
far not completely `objective.'
Blochinzev formulates matter slightly differently from Alexandrov: `In quantum mechanics we
describe not a state of the particle in itself but the fact that the particle belongs to this or that
statistical assembly. This belonging is.completely objective and does not depend on statements
made by the observer.' Such formulations, however, take us very far – probably too far – away
from materialistic ontology. To make this point clear it is useful to recall how this belonging to a
statistical assembly is used in the interpretation of classical thermodynamics. If an observer has
determined the temperature of a system and wants to draw from his results conclusions about
the molecular motions in the system he is able to say that the system is just one sample out of a
canonical ensemble and thus he may consider it as possibly having different energies. `
In reality'
– so we would conclude in classical physics – the system has only one definite energy at a given
time, and none of the others is realized. The observer has been deceived if he considered a
different energy at that moment as possible. The canonical ensemble contains statements not only
about the system itself but also about the observer's incomplete knowledge of the system. If
Blochinzev in quantum theory tries to call a system's belonging to an assembly `completely
objective,' he uses the word `objective' in a different sense from that in classical physics. For in
classical physics this belonging means, as has been said, statements not only about the system but
also about the observer's degree ofknowledge of the system. One exception must be made to this
assertion in quantum theory. If in quantum theory the assembly is characterized by only one wave
function in configuration space (and not, as usual, by a statistical matrix), we meet a special
situation (the so-called `pure case
'
) in which the description can be called objective in some sense
and in which the element of incomplete knowledge does not occur immediately. But since every
measurement would (on account of its irreversible features) reintroduce the element of incomplete
knowledge, the situation would not be fundamentally different.
91
Above all, we see from these formulations how difficult it is when we try to push new ideas
into an old system of concepts belonging to an earlier philosophy – or, to use an old metaphor,
when we attempt to put new wine into old bottles. Such attempts are always distressing, for they
mislead us into continually occupying ourselves with the inevitable cracks in the old bottles
instead of rejoicing over the new wine. We cannot possibly expect those thinkers who a century
ago introduced dialectic materialism to have foreseen the development of quantum theory. Their
concepts of matter and reality could not possibly be adapted to the results of the refined
experimental technique of our days.
Perhaps one should add at this point some general remarks about the attitude of the scientist
to a special creed; it may be a religious or a political creed. The fundamental difference between
the religious and the political creed – that the latter refers to the immediate material reality of the
world around us, while the former has as its object another reality beyond the material world – is
not important for this special question; it is the problem of creed itself that is to be discussed.
From what has been said one would be inclined to demand that the scientist should never rely on
special doctrines, never confine his method of thinking to a special philosophy. He should always
be prepared to have the foundations of his knowledge changed by new experience. But this
demand would again be an oversimplification of our situation in life for two reasons. The first is
that the structure of our thinking is determined in our youth by ideas which we meet at that time
or by getting into contact with strong personalities from whom we learn. This structure will form
an integrating part of all our later work and it may well make it difficult for us to adapt ourselves
to entirely different ideas later on. The second reason is-that we belong to a community or a
society. This community is kept together by common ideas, by a common scale of ethical values,
or by a common language in which one speaks about the general problems of life. The common
ideas may be supported by the authority of a church, a party or the state and, even if this is not
the case; it may be difficult to go away from the common ideas without getting into conflict with
the community. Yet the results of scientific thinking may contradict some
92
of the common ideas. Certainly it would be unwise to demand that the scientist should generally
not be a loyal member of his community, that he should be deprived of the happiness that may
come from belonging to a community, and it would be equally unwise to desire that the common
ideas of society which from the scientific point of view are always simplifications should change
instantaneously with the progress of scientific knowledge, that they should be as variable as
scientific theories must necessarily be. Therefore, at this point we come back even in our time to
the old problem of the `
twofold truth' that has filled the history of Christian religion throughout
the later Middle Ages. There is the very disputable doctrine that `positive religion — whatever
form it may take — is an indispensable need for the mass of the people, while the man of science
seeks the real truth back of religion and seeks it only there."Science is esoteric,' so it is said, `
it is
only for the few.' If in our time political doctrines and social activities take the part of positive
religion in some countries, the problem is still essentially the same. The scientist'
s first claim will
always be intellectual honesty, while the community will frequently ask of the scientist that — in
view of the variability of science — he at least wait a few decades before expressing in public his
dissenting opinions. There is probably no simple solution to this problem, if tolerance alone is not
sufficient; but some consolation may come from the fact that it is certainly an old problem
belonging to human life.
Coming back now to the counterproposals to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory
we have to discuss the second group of proposals, which try to change quantum theory in order
to arrive at a different philosophical interpretation. The most careful attempt in this direction has
been made by Janossy, who has realized that the rigorous validity of quantum mechanics
compels us to depart from the reality concept of classical physics. He therefore seeks to alter
quantum mechanics in such a way that, although many of the results remain true, its structure
approaches that of classical physics. His point of attack is what is called `
the reduction of wave
packets,' i.e., the fact that the wave function or, more generally, the probability function changes
discontinuously when the observer takes cognizance of a result of measurement. Janossy notices
that this reduction cannot
93
be deduced from the differential equations of the mathematical formalism and he believes that
he can conclude from this that there is an inconsistency in the usual interpretation. It is well
known that the `reduction of wave packets' always appears in the Copenhagen interpretation
when the transition is completed from the possible to the actual. The probability function, which
covered a wide range of possibilities, is suddenly reduced to a much narrower range by the fact
that the experiment has led to a definite result, that actually a certain event has happened. In
the formalism this reduction requires that the so-called interference of probabilities, which is the
most characteristic phenomenon of quantum theory, is destroyed by the partly undefinable and
irreversible interactions of the system with the measuring apparatus and the rest of the world.
Janossy now tries to alter quantum mechanics by the introduction of so-called damping terms
into the equations, in such a way that the interference terms disappear of themselves after a
finite time. Even if this corresponds to reality – and there is no reason to suppose this from the
experiments that have been performed – there would still remain a number of alarming
consequences of such an interpretation, as Janossy himself points out (e.g., waves which are
propagated faster than the velocity of light, interchange of the time sequence of cause and
effect, etc.). Therefore, we should hardly be ready to sacrifice the simplicity of quantum theory
for this kind of view until we are compelled by experiments to do so.
Among the remaining opponents of what is sometimes called the `orthodox' interpretation of
quantum theory, Schrodinger has taken an exceptional position inasmuch as he would ascribe
the `objective reality' not to the particles but to the waves and is not prepared to interpret the
waves as `probability waves only.' In his paper entitled `Are There Quantum Jumps?'
 he
attempts to deny the existence of quantum jumps altogether (one may question the suitability of
the term `quantum jump' at this place and could replace it by the less provocative term
`discontinuity'). Now, Schrodinger's work first of all contains some misunderstanding of the
usual interpretation. He overlooks the fact that only the waves in configuration space (or the
`transformation matrices') are probability waves in the usual
94
interpretation, while the three-dimensional matter waves or radiation waves are not. The latter
have just as much and just as little `
reality' as the particles; they have no direct connection with
probability waves but have a continuous density of energy and momentum, like an
electromagnetic field in Maxwell's theory. Schrodinger therefore rightly emphasizes that at this
point the processes can be conceived of as being more continuous than they usually are. But this
interpretation cannot remove the element of discontinuity that is found everywhere in atomic
physics; any scintillation screen or Geiger counter demonstrates this element at once. In the
usual interpretation of quantum theory it is contained in the transition from the possible to the
actual. Schrodinger himself makes no counterproposal as to how he intends to introduce the
element of discontinuity, everywhere observable, in a different manner from the usual
interpretation.
Finally, the criticism which Einstein, Laue and others have expressed in several papers
concentrates on the question whether the Copenhagen interpretation permits a unique, objective
description of the physical facts. Their essential arguments may be stated in the following terms:
The mathematical scheme of quantum theory seems to be a perfectly adequate description of the
statistics of atomic phenomena. But even if its statements about the probability of atomic events
are completely correct, this interpretation does not describe what actually happens independently
of or between the observations. But something must happen, this we cannot doubt; this
something need not be described in terms of electrons or waves or light quanta, but unless it is
described somehow the task of physics is not completed. It cannot be admitted that it refers to the
act of observation only. The physicist must postulate in his science that he is studying a world
which he himself has not made and which would be present, essentially unchanged, if he were not
there. Therefore, the Copenhagen interpretation offers no real understanding of the atomic 
phenomena.
It is easily seen that what this criticism demands is again the old materialistic ontology. But
what can be the answer from the point of view of the Copenhagen interpretation?
We can say that physics is a part of science and as such aims at a description and
undertanding of nature. Any kind of understanding,
95
be deduced from the differential equations of the mathematical formalism and he believes that
he can conclude from this that there is an inconsistency in the usual interpretation. It is well
known that the `reduction of wave packets' always appears in the Copenhagen interpretation
when the transition is completed from the possible to the actual. The probability function, which
covered a wide range of possibilities, is suddenly reduced to a much narrower range by the fact
that the experiment has led to a definite result, that actually a certain event has happened. In
the formalism this reduction requires that the so-called interference of probabilities, which is the
most characteristic phenomenon of quantum theory, is destroyed by the partly undefinable and
irreversible interactions of the system with the measuring apparatus and the rest of the world.
Janossy now tries to alter quantum mechanics by the introduction of so-called damping terms
into the equations, in such a way that the interference terms disappear of themselves after a
finite time. Even if this corresponds to reality – and there is no reason to suppose this from the
experiments that have been performed – there would still remain a number of alarming
consequences of such an interpretation, as Janossy himself points out (e.g., waves which are
propagated faster than the velocity of light, interchange of the time sequence of cause and
effect, etc.). Therefore, we should hardly be ready to sacrifice the simplicity of quantum theory
for this kind of view until we are compelled by experiments to do so.
Among the remaining opponents of what is sometimes called the `orthodox' interpretation of
quantum theory, Schrodinger has taken an exceptional position inasmuch as he would ascribe
the `objective reality' not to the particles but to the waves and is not prepared to interpret the
waves as `probability waves only.' In his paper entitled `Are There Quantum Jumps?' he
attempts to deny the existence of quantum jumps altogether (one may question the suitability of
the term `quantum jump' at this place and could replace it by the less provocative term
`discontinuity'). Now, Schrodinger's work first of all contains some misunderstanding of the
usual interpretation. He overlooks the fact that only the waves in configuration space (or the
`transformation matrices') are probability waves in the usual
96
A few remarks may be added concerning the formal structure of all the counterproposals
hitherto made against the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory. All these proposals
have found themselves compelled to sacrifice the essential symmetry properties of quantum
theory (for instance, the symmetry between waves and particles or between position and
velocity). Therefore, we may well suppose that the Copenhagen interpretation cannot be avoided
if these symmetry properties — like the Lorentz invariance in the theory of relativity — are held to
be a genuine feature of nature; and every experiment yet performed supports this view.

Quantum Theory and the Structure of Matter
The concept of matter has undergone a great number of changes in the history of human
thinking. Different interpretations have been given in different philosophical systems. All these
different meanings of the word are still present in a greater or lesser degree in what we conceive
in our time as the word `matter.'
The early Greek philosophy from Thales to the Atomists, in seeking the unifying principle in the
universal mutability of all things, had formed the concept of cosmic matter, a world substance
which experiences all these transformations, from which all individual things arise and into which
they become again transformed. This matter was partly identified with some specific matter like
water was air or fire; only partly, because it had no other attribute but to be the material from
which all things are made.
Later, in the philosophy of Aristotle, matter was thought of in the relation between form and
matter. All that we perceive in the world of phenomena around us is formed matter. Matter is in
itself not a reality but only a possibility, a `potentia'
; it exists only by means of form. In the
natural process the `essence,'
 as Aristotle calls it, passes over from mere possibility through form
into actuality. The matter of Aristotle is certainly not a specific matter like water or air, nor is it
simply empty space; it is a kind of indefinite corporeal substratum, embodying the possibility of
passing over into actuality by means of the form. The typical examples of this relation between
matter and form in the philosophy of Aristotle are the biological processes in which matter is
formed to become the living organism, and the building and forming activity of man. The statue
is potentially in the marble before it is cut out by the sculptor.
98
Then, much later, starting from the philosophy of Descartes, matter was primarily thought of as
opposed to mind. There were the two complementary aspects of the world, `matter' and `mind,'
or, as Descartes put it, the `res extensa' and the `res cogitans.' Since the new methodical
principles of natural science, especially of mechanics, excluded all tracing of corporeal
phenomena back to spiritual forces, matter could be considered as a reality of its own
independent of the mind and of any supernatural powers. The `matter' of this period is `formed
matter,' the process of formation being interpreted as a causal chain of mechanical interactions; it
has lost its connection with the vegetative soul of Aristotelian philosophy, and therefore the
dualism between matter and form is no longer relevant. It is this concept of matter which
constitutes by far the strongest component in our present use of the word `matter.'
Finally, in the natural science of the nineteenth century another dualism has played some role,
the dualism between matter and force, Matter is that on which forces can act; or matter can
produce forces. Matter, for instance, produces the force of gravity, and this force acts on matter.
Matter and force are two distinctly different aspects of the corporeal world. In so far as the
forces may be formative forces this distinction comes closer to the Aristotelian distinction of
matter and form. On the other hand, in the most recent development of modern physics this
distinction between matter and force is completely lost, since every field of force contains energy
and in so far constitutes matter. To every field of force there belongs a specific kind of elementary
particles with essentially the same properties as all other atomic units of matter.
When natural science investigates the problem of matter it can do so only through a study of
the forms of matter. The infinite variety and mutability of the forms of matter must be the 
immediate object of the investigation and the efforts must be directed toward finding some
natural laws, some unifying principles that can serve as a guide through this immense field.
Therefore, natural science — and especially physics — has concentrated its interest for a long
period on an analysis of the structure of matter and of the forces responsible for this structure.
99
Since the time of Galileo the fundamental method of natural science had been the experiment.
This method made it possible to pass from general experience to specific experience, to single
out characteristic events in nature from which its `laws' could be studied more directly than from
general experience. If one wanted to study the structure of matter one had to do experiments
with matter. One had to expose matter to extreme conditions in order to study its transmutations
there, in the hope of finding the fundamental features of matter which persist under all apparent
changes.
In the early days of modern natural science this was the object of chemistry, and this
endeavor led rather early to the concept of the chemical element. A substance that could not be
further dissolved or disintegrated by any of the means at the disposal of the chemist — boiling,
burning, dissolving, mixing with other substances, etc. — was called an element. The introduction
of this concept was a first and most important step toward an understanding of the structure of
matter. The enormous variety of substances was at least reduced to a comparatively small
number of more fundamental substances, the `elements,' and thereby some order could be
established among the various phenomena of chemistry. The word `atom' was consequently
used to designate the smallest unit of matter belonging to a chemical element, and the smallest
particle of a chemical compound could be pictured as a small group of different atoms. The
smallest particle of the element iron, e.g., was an iron atom, and the smallest particle of water,
the water molecule, consisted of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms.
The next and almost equally important step was the discovery of the conservation of mass in
the chemical process. For instance, when the element carbon is burned into carbon dioxide the
mass of the carbon dioxide is equal to the sum of the masses of the carbon and the oxygen
before the process. It was this discovery that gave a quantitative meaning to the concept of
matter: independent of its chemical properties matter could be measured by its mass.
During the following period, mainly the nineteenth century, a number of new chemical
elements were discovered; in our time this number has reached one hundred. This development
showed quite
100
clearly that the concept of the chemical element had not yet reached the point where one could
understand the unity of matter. It was not satisfactory to believe that there are very many kinds of
matter, qualitatively different and without any connection between one another.
In the beginning of the nineteenth century some evidence for a connection between the
different elements was found in the fact that the atomic weights of different elements frequently
seemed to be integer multiples of a smallest unit near to the atomic weight of hydrogen. The
similarity in the chemical behavior of some elements was another hint leading in the same
direction. But only the discovery of forces much stronger than those applied in chemical processes
could really establish the connection between the different elements and thereby lead to a closer
unification of matter.
These forces were actually found in the radioactive process discovered in 1896 by Becquerel.
Successive investigations by Curie, Rutherford and others revealed the transmutation of elements
in the radioactive process. The a-particles are emitted in these processes as fragments of the
atoms with an energy about a million times greater than the energy of a single atomic particle in 
a chemical process. Therefore, these particles could be used as new tools for investigating the
inner structure of the atom. The result of Rutherford's experiments on the scattering of a-rayswas the nuclear model of the atom in 1911. The most important feature of this well-known model
was the separation of the atom into two distinctly different parts, the atomic nucleus and the
surrounding electronic shells. The nucleus in the middle of the atom occupies only an extremely
small fraction of the space filled by the atom (its radius is about a hundred thousand times smaller
than that of the atom), but contains almost its entire mass. Its positive electric charge, which is
an integer multiple of the so-called elementary charge, determines the number of the surrounding
electrons – the atom as a whole must be electrically neutral – and the shapes of their orbits.
This distinction between the atomic nucleus and the electronic shells at once gave a proper
explanation of the fact that for chemistry the chemical elements are the last units of matter and
that very much stronger forces are required to change the elements into each other.
101
The chemical bond between neighboring atoms is due to an inter-action of the electronic shells,
and the energies of this interaction are comparatively small. An electron that is accelerated in a
discharge tube by a potential of only several volts has sufficient energy to excite the electronic
shells to the emission of radiation, or to destroy the chemical bond in a molecule. But the
chemical behavior of the atom, though it consists of the behavior of its electronic shells, is
determined by the charge of the nucleus. One has to change the nucleus if one wants to change
the chemical properties, and this requires energies about a million times greater.
The nuclear model of the atom, however, if it is thought of as a system obeying Newton's
mechanics, could not explain the stability of the atom. As has been pointed out in an earlier
chapter, only the application of quantum theory to this model through the work of Bohr could
account for the fact that, for example, a carbon atom after having been in interaction with other
atoms or after having emitted radiation always finally remains a carbon atom with the same
electronic shells as before. This stability could be explained simply by those features of quantum
theory that prevent a simple objective description in space and time of the structure of the
atom.
In this way one finally had a first basis for the understanding of matter. The chemical and
other properties of the atoms could be accounted for by applying the mathematical scheme of
quantum theory to the electronic shells. From this basis one could try to extend the analysis of the
structure of matter in two opposite directions. One could either study the interaction of atoms,
their relation to larger units like molecules or crystals or biological objects; or one could try
through the investigation of the atomic nucleus and its components to penetrate to the final
unity of matter. Research has proceeded on both lines during the past decades and we shall in
the following pages be concerned with the role of quantum theory in these two fields.
The forces between neighboring atoms are primarily electric forces, the attraction of opposite
and the repulsion of equal charges; the electrons are attracted by the nuclei and repelled from
each other. But these forces act not according to the laws of Newtonian mechanics but those of
quantum mechanics.
102
This leads to two different types of binding between atoms. In the one type the electron of
one atom passes over to the other one, for example, to fill up a nearly closed electronic shell. In
this case both atoms are finally charged and form what the physicist calls ions, and since their
charges are opposite they attract each other.
In the second type one electron belongs in a way characteristic of quantum theory to both 
atoms. Using the picture of the electronic orbit, one might say that the electron goes around
both nuclei spending a comparable amount of time in the one and in the other atom. This
second type of binding corresponds to what the chemists call a valency bond.
These two types of forces, which may occur in any mixture, cause the formation of various
groupings of atoms and seem to be ultimately responsible for all the complicated structures of
matter in bulk that are studied in physics and chemistry. The formation of chemical compounds
takes place through the formation of small closed groups of different atoms, each group being one
molecule of the compound. The formation of crystals is due to the arrangement of the atoms in
regular lattices. Metals are formed when the atoms are so tightly packed that their outer
electrons can leave their shells and wander through the whole crystal. Magnetism is due to the
spinning motion of the electron, and so on.
In all these cases the dualism between matter and force can still be retained, since one may
consider nuclei and electrons as the fragments of matter that are kept together by means of the
electromagnetic forces.
While in this way physics and chemistry have come to an almost complete union in their
relations to the structure of matter, biology deals with structures of a more complicated and
somewhat different type. It is true that in spite of the wholeness of the living organism a sharp
distinction between animate and inanimate matter can certainly not be made. The development of
biology has supplied us with a great number of examples where one can see that specific
biological functions are carried by special large molecules or groups or chains of such molecules,
and there has been an increasing tendency in modern biology to explain biological processes as
consequences of
103
the laws of physics and chemistry. But the kind of stability that is displayed by the living
organism is of a nature somewhat different from the stability of atoms or crystals. It is a stability
of process or function rather than a stability of form. There can be no doubt that the laws of
quantum theory play a very important role in the biological phenomena. For instance, those
specific quantum-theoretical forces that can be described only inaccurately by the concept of
chemical valency are essential for the understanding of the big organic molecules and their
various geometrical patterns; the experiments on biological mutations produced by radiation
show both the relevance of the statistical quantum-theoretical laws and the existence of amplifying mechanisms. The close analogy between the working of our nervous system and the
functioning of modern electronic computers stresses again the importance of single elementary
processes in the living organism. Still all this does not prove that physics and chemistry will,
together with the concept of evolution, someday offer a complete description of the living
organism. The biological processes must be handled by the experimenting scientist with greater
caution than processes of physics and chemistry. As Bohr has pointed out, it may well be that a
description of the living organism that could be called complete from the standpoint of the
physicist cannot be given, since it would require experiments that interfere too strongly with the
biological functions. Bohr has described this situation by saying that in biology we are concerned
with manifestations of possibilities in that nature to which we belong rather than with outcomes of
experiments which we can ourselves perform. The situation of complementarity to which this
formulation alludes is represented as a tendency in the methods of modern biological research
which, on the one hand, makes full use of all the methods and results of physics and chemistry
and, on the other hand, is based on concepts referring to those features of organic nature that are
not contained in physics or chemistry, like the concept of life itself.
So far we have followed the analysis of the structure of matter in one direction: from the atom
to the more complicated structures consisting of many atoms; from atomic physics to the physics
of solid bodies, to chemistry and to biology. Now we have to turn to the
104
opposite direction and follow the line of research from the outer parts of the atom to the inner
parts and from the nucleus to the elementary particles. It is this line which will possibly lead to
an understanding of the unity of matter. Here we need not be afraid of destroying characteristic
structures by our experiments. When the task is set to test the final unity of matter we may
expose matter to the strongest possible forces, to the most extreme conditions, in order to see
whether any matter can ultimately be transmuted into any other matter.
The first step in this direction was the experimental analysis of the atomic nucleus. In the initial
period of these studies, which filled approximately the first three decades of our century, the only
tools available for experiments on the nucleus were the a-particles emitted from radioactive
bodies. With the help of these particles Rutherford succeeded in 1919 in transmuting nuclei of
light elements; he could, for instance, transmute a nitrogen nucleus into an oxygen nucleus by
adding the a-particle to the nitrogen nucleus and at the same time knocking out one proton. This
was the first example of processes on a nuclear scale that reminded one of chemical processes,
but led to the artificial transmutation of elements. The next substantial progress was, as is well
known, the artificial acceleration of protons by means of high-tension equipment to energies
sufficient to cause nuclear transmutation. Voltages of roughly one million volts are required for
this purpose and Cockcroft and Walton in their first decisive experiment succeeded in
transmuting nuclei of the element lithium into those of helium. This discovery opened up an
entirely new line of research, which may be called nuclear physics in the proper sense and which
very soon led to a qualitative understanding of the structure of the atomic nucleus.
The structure of the nucleus was indeed very simple. The atomic nucleus consists of only two
kinds of elementary particles. The one is the proton which is at the same time simply the
hydrogen nucleus; the other is called neutron, a particle which has roughly the mass of the proton
but is electrically neutral. Every nucleus can be characterized by the number of protons and
neutrons of which it consists. The normal carbon nucleus, for instance, consists of 6 protons and
6 neutrons.
105
There are other carbon nuclei, less frequent in number (called isotopic to the first ones), that
consist of 6 protons and 7 neutrons, etc. So one had finally reached a description of matter in
which, instead of the many different chemical elements, only three fundamental units occurred:
the proton, the neutron and the electron. All matter consists of atoms and therefore is constructed
from these three fundamental building stones. This was not yet the unity of matter, but certainly
a great step toward unification and — perhaps still more important — simplification. There was of
course still a long way to go from the knowledge of the two building stones of the nucleus to a
complete understanding of its structure. The problem here was somewhat different from the
corresponding problem in the outer atomic shells that had been solved in the middle of the
twenties. In the electronic shells the forces between the particles were known with great accuracy,
but the dynamic laws had to be found, and were found in quantum mechanics. In the nucleus
the dynamic laws could well be supposed to be just those of quantum mechanics, but the forces
between the particles were not known beforehand; they had to be derived from the experimental
properties of the nuclei. This problem has not yet been completely solved. The forces have
probably not such a simple form as the electrostatic forces in the electronic shells and therefore
the mathematical difficulty of computing the properties from complicated forces and the inaccuracy
of the experiments make progress difficult. But a qualitative understanding of the structure of the
nucleus has definitely been reached.
Then there remained the final problem, the unity of matter. Are these fundamental building
stones — proton, neutron and electron — final indestructible units of matter, atoms in the sense
of Democritus, without any relation except for the forces that act between them or are they just 
different forms of the same kind of matter? Can they again be transmuted into each other and
possibly into other forms of matter as well? An experimental attack on this problem requires forces
and energies concentrated on atomic particles much larger than those that have been necessary
to investigate the atomic nucleus. Since the energies stored up in atomic nuclei are not big
enough to provide us with a tool for such experiments, the physicists have to rely either on
106
the forces in cosmic dimensions or on the ingenuity and skill of the engineers.
Actually, progress has been made on both lines. In the first case the physicists make use of the
so-called cosmic radiation. The electomagnetic fields on the surface of stars extending over huge
spaces are under certain circumstances able to accelerate charged atomic particles, electrons and
nuclei. The nuclei, owing to their greater inertia, seem to have a better chance of remaining in
the accelerating field for a long distance, and finally when they leave the surface of the star into
empty space they have already traveled through potentials of several thousand million volts.
There may be a further acceleration in the magnetic fields between the stars; in any case the
nuclei seem to be kept within the space of the galaxy for a long time by varying magnetic fields,
and finally they fill this space with what one calls cosmic radiation. This radiation reaches the
earth from the outside and consists of nuclei of practically all kinds, hydrogen and helium and
many heavier elements, having energies from roughly a hundred or a thousand million electron
volts to, again in rare cases, a million times this amount. When the particles of this cosmic
radiation penetrate-into the atmosphere of the earth they hit the nitrogen atoms or oxygen atoms
of the atmosphere or may hit the atoms in any experimental equipment exposed to the radiation.
The other line of research was the construction of big accelerating machines, the prototype of
which was the so-called cyclotron constructed by Lawrence in California in the early thirties. The
underlying idea of these machines is to keep by means of a big magnetic field the charged particles
going round in circles a great number of times so that they can be pushed again and again by
electric fields on their way around. Machines reaching up to energies of several hundred million
electron volt are in use in Great Britain, and through the co-operation of twelve European
countries a very big machine of this type is now being constructed in Geneva which we hope will
reach up to energies of 25,000 million electron volts. The experiments carried out by means of
cosmic radiation or of the big accelerators have revealed new interesting features of matter.
Besides the three fundamental building stones of matter – electron, proton and neutron – new
elementary
107
particles have been found which can be created in these processes of highest energies and
disappear again after a short time. The new particles have similar properties as the old ones
except for their instability. Even the most stable ones have lifetimes of roughly only a millionth part
of a second, and the lifetimes of others are even a thousand times smaller. At the present time
about twenty-five different new elementary particles are known; the most recent one is the
negative proton.
These results seem at first sight to lead away from the idea of the unity of matter, since the
number of fundamental units of matter seems to have again increased to values comparable to
the number of different chemical elements. But this would not be a proper interpretation. The
experiments have at the same time shown that the particles can be created from other particles or
simply from the kinetic energy of such particles, and they can again disintegrate into other
particles. Actually the experiments have shown the complete mutability of matter. All the
elementary particles can, at sufficiently high energies, be transmuted into other particles, or they
can simply be created from kinetic energy and can be annihilated into energy, for instance into 
radiation. Therefore, we have here actually the final proof for the unity of matter. All the
elementary particles are made of the same substance, which we may call energy or universal
matter; they are just different forms in which matter can appear.
If we compare this situation with the Aristotelian concepts of matter and form, we can say that
the matter of Aristotle, which is mere `potentia,' should be compared to our concept of energy,
which gets into `actuality' by means of the form, when the elementary particle is created.
Modern physics is of course not satisfied with only qualitative description of the fundamental
structure of matter; it must try on the basis of careful experimental investigations to get a
mathematical formulation of those natural laws that determine the `forms' of matter, the
elementary particles and their forces. A clear distinction between matter and force can no longer
be made in this part of physics, since each elementary particle not only is producing some forces
and is acted upon by forces, but it is at the same time representing a certain
108
field of force. The quantum-theoretical dualism of waves and particles makes the same entity
appear both as matter and as force.
All the attempts to find a mathematical description for the laws concerning the elementary
particles have so far started from the quantum theory of wave fields. Theoretical work on
theories of this type started early in the thirties. But the very first investigations on this line
revealed serious difficulties the roots of which lay in the combination of quantum theory and the
theory of special relativity. At first sight it would seem that the two theories, quantum theory and
the theory of relativity, refer to such different aspects of nature that they should have practically
nothing to do with each other, that it should be easy to fulfill the requirements of both theories in
the same formalism. A closer inspection, however, shows that the two theories do interfere at
one point, and that it is from this point that all the difficulties arise.
The theory of special relativity had revealed a structure of space and time somewhat different
from the structure that was generally assumed since Newtonian mechanics. The most
characteristic feature of this newly discovered structure is the existence of a maximum velocity
that cannot be surpassed by any moving body or any traveling signal, the velocity of light. As a
consequence of this, two events at distant points cannot have any immediate causal connection if
they take place at such times that a light signal starting at the instant of the event on one point
reaches the other point only after the time the other event has happened there; and vice versa.
In this case the two events may be called simultaneous. Since no action of any kind can reach
from the one event at the one point in time to the other event at the other point, the two events
are not connected by any causal action.
For this reason any action at a distance of the type, say, of the gravitational forces in
Newtonian mechanics was not compatible with the theory of special relativity. The theory had to
replace such action by actions from point to point, from one point only to the points in an
infinitesimal neighborhood. The most natural mathematical expressions for actions of this type
were the differential equations for waves or fields that were invariant for the Lorentz
transformation.
109
Such differential equations exclude any direct action between 'simultaneous' events.
Therefore, the structure of space and time expressed in the theory of special relativity implied
an infinitely sharp boundary between the region of simultaneousness, in which no action could be
transmitted, and the other regions, in which a direct action from event to event could take place.
On the other hand, in quantum theory the uncertainty relations put a definite limit on the
accuracy with which positions and momenta, or time and energy, can be measured 
simultaneously. Since an infinitely sharp boundary means an infinite accuracy with respect to
position in space and time, the momenta or energies must be completely undetermined, or in
fact arbitrarily high momenta and energies must occur with overwhelming probability. Therefore,
any theory which tries to fulfill the requirements of both special relativity and quantum theory will
lead to mathematical inconsistencies, to divergencies in the region of very high energies and
momenta. This sequence of conclusions may perhaps not seem strictly binding, since any formalism of the type under consideration is very complicated and could perhaps offer some
mathematical possibilities for avoiding the clash between quantum theory and relativity. But so
far all the mathematical schemes that have been tried did in fact lead either to divergencies, i.e.,
to mathematical contradictions, or did not fulfill all the requirements of the two theories. And it
was easy to see that the difficulties actually came from the point that has been discussed.
The way in which the convergent mathematical schemes did not fulfill the requirements of
relativity or quantum theory was in itself quite interesting. For instance, one scheme, when
interpreted in terms of actual events in space and time, led to a kind of time reversal; it would
predict processes in which suddenly at some point in space particles are created, the energy of
which is later provided for by some other collision process between elementary particles at some
other point. The physicists are convinced from their experiments that processes of this type do
not occur in nature, at least not if the two processes are separated by measurable distances in
space and time. Another mathematical scheme tried to avoid the divergencies through
110
a mathematical process which is called renormalization; it seemed possible to push the infinities
to a place in the formalism where they could not interfere with the establishment of the welldefined relations between those quantities that can be directly observed. Actually this scheme
has led to very substantial progress in quantum electrodynamics, since it accounts for some
interesting details in the hydrogen spectrum that had not been understood before. A closer
analysis of this mathematical scheme, however, has made it probable that those quantities
which in normal quantum theory must be interpreted as probabilities can under certain
circumstances become negative in the formalism of renormalization. This would prevent the
consistent use of the formalism for the description of matter.
The final solution of these difficulties has not yet been found. It will emerge someday from
the collection of more and more accurate experimental material about the different elementary
particles, their creation and annihilation, the forces between them. In looking for possible
solutions of the difficulties one should perhaps remember that such processes with time reversal
as have been discussed before could not be excluded experimentally, if they took place only
within extremely small regions of space and time outside the range of our present experimental
equipment. Of course one would be reluctant to accept such processes with time reversal if
there could be at any later stage of physics the possibility of following experimentally such events
in the same sense as one follows ordinary atomic events. But here the analysis of quantum
theory and of relativity may again help us to see the problem in a new light.
The theory of relativity is connected with a universal constant in nature, the velocity of light.
This constant determines the relation between space and time and is therefore implicitly
contained in any natural law which must fulfill the requirements of Lorentz invariance. Our natural
language and the concepts of classical physics can apply only to phenomena for which the
velocity of light can be considered as practically infinite.
When we in our experiments approach the velocity of light we must be prepared for results
which cannot be interpreted in these concepts.
111
Quantum theory is connected with another universal constant of nature, Planck's quantum of
action. An objective description for events in space and time is possible only when we have to
deal with objects or processes on a comparatively large scale, where Planck's constant can be
regarded as infinitely small. When our experiments approach the region where the quantum of
action becomes essential we get into all those difficulties with the usual concepts that have been
discussed in earlier chapters of this volume.
There must exist a third universal constant in nature. This is obvious for purely dimensional
reasons. The universal constants determine the scale of nature, the characteristic quantities that
cannot be reduced to other quantities. One needs at least three fundamental units for a complete
set of units. This is most easily seen from such conventions as the use of the c-g-s system
(centimeter, gram, second system) by the physicists. A unit of length, one of time, and one of
mass is sufficient to form a complete set; but one must have at least three units. One could also
replace them by units of length, velocity and mass; or by units of length, velocity and energy,
etc. But at least three fundamental units are necessary. Now, the velocity of light and Planck's
constant of action provide only two of these units. There must be a third one, and only a theory
which contains this third unit can possibly determine the masses and other properties of the
elementary particles. Judging from our present knowledge of these particles the most appropriate
way of introducing the third universal constant would be by the assumption of a universal length
the value of which should be roughly io-13 cm, that is, somewhat smaller than the radii of the light
atomic nuclei. When from such three units one forms an expression which in its dimension
corresponds to a mass, its value has the order of magnitude of the masses of the elementary
particles.
If we assume that the laws of nature do contain a third universal constant of the dimension of
a length and of the order of io3 cm, then we would again expect our usual concepts to apply
only to regions in space and time that are large as compared to the universal constant. We
should again be prepared for phenomena of a qualitatively new character when we in our
experiments approach regions in
112
space and time smaller than the nuclear radii. The phenomenon of time reversal, which has been
discussed and which so far has only resulted from theoretical considerations as a mathematical
possibility, might therefore belong to these smallest regions. If so, it could probably not be
observed in a way that would permit a description in terms of the classical concepts. Such
processes would probably, so far as they can be observed and described in classical terms, obey
the usual time order.
But all these problems will be a matter of future research in atomic physics. One may hope that
the combined effort of experiments in the high energy region and of mathematical analysis will
someday lead to a complete understanding of the unity of matter. The term `complete
understanding' would mean that the forms of matter in the sense of Aristotelian philosophy would
appear as results, as solutions of a closed mathematical scheme representing the natural laws for
matter.

Language and Reality in Modern Physics
Throughout the history of science new discoveries and new ideas have always caused scientific
disputes, have led to polemical publications criticizing the new ideas, and such criticism has often
been helpful in their development; but these controversies have never before reached that
degree of violence which they attained after the discovery of the theory of relativity and in a
lesser degree after quantum theory. In both cases the scientific problems have finally become
connected with political issues, and some scientists have taken recourse to political methods to
carry their views through. This violent reaction on the recent development of modern physics can
only be understood when one realizes that here the foundations of physics have started moving;
and that this motion has caused the feeling that the ground would be cut from science. At the
same time it probably means that one has not yet found the correct language with which to speak
about the new situation and that the incorrect statements published here and there in the
enthusiasm about the new discoveries have caused all kinds of misunderstanding. This is indeed
a fundamental problem. The improved experimental technique of our time brings into the scope
of science new aspects of nature which cannot be described in terms of the common concepts.
But in what language, then, should they be described? The first language that emerges from the
process of scientific clarification is in theoretical physics usually a mathematical language, the
mathematical scheme, which allows one to predict the results of experiments. The physicist may
be satisfied when he has the mathematical scheme and knows how to use it for the interpretation
of the experiments. But he has to speak about his results also to nonphysicists who will not be
satisfied unless some explanation is
114
given in plain language, understandable to anybody. Even for the physicist the description in
plain language will be a criterion of the degree of understanding that has been reached. To what
extent is such a description at all possible? Can one speak about the atom itself? This is a
problem of language as much as of physics, and therefore some remarks are necessary
concerning language in general and scientific language specifically.
Language was formed during the prehistoric age among the human race as a means for
communication and as a basis for thinking. We know little about the various steps in its formation;
but language now contains a great number of concepts which are a suitable tool for more or less
unambiguous communication about events in daily life. These concepts are acquired gradually
without critical analysis by using the language, and after having used a word sufficiently often we
think that we more or less know what it means. It is of course a well-known fact that the words
are not so clearly defined as they seem to be at first sight and that they have only a limited
range of applicability. For instance, we can speak about a piece of iron or a piece of wood, but we
cannot speak about a piece of water. The word `piece'
 does not apply to liquid substances. Or, to
mention another example: In discussions about the limitations of concepts, Bohr likes to tell the
following story: `A little boy goes into a grocer's shop with a penny in his hand and asks: "Could I
have a penny's worth of mixed sweets?
"
 The grocer takes two sweets and hands them to the boy
saying: "Here you have two sweets. You can do the mixing yourself."'' A more serious example of
the problematic relation between words and concepts is the fact that the words `
red
'
 and `green'
are used even by people who are colorblind, though the ranges of applicability of these terms
must be quite different for them from what they are for other people.
This intrinsic uncertainty of the meaning of words was of course recognized very early and has 
brought about the need for definitions, or – as the word `definition' says – for the setting of
boundaries that determine where the word is to be used and where not. But definitions can be
given only with the help of other concepts, and so one will finally have to rely on some concepts
that are taken as they are, unanalyzed and undefined.
115
In Greek philosophy the problem of the concepts in language has been a major theme since
Socrates, whose life was – if we can follow Plato's artistic representation in his dialogues – a
continuous discussion about the content of the concepts in language and about the limitations in
modes of expression. In order to obtain a solid basis for scientific thinking, Aristotle in his logic
started to analyze the forms of language, the formal structure of conclusions and deductions
independent of their content. In this way he reached a degree of abstraction and precision that
had been unknown up to that time in Greek philosophy and he thereby contributed immensely to
the clarification, to the establishment of order in our methods of thought. He actually created the
basis for the scientific language.
On the other hand, this logical analysis of language again involves the danger of an
oversimplification. In logic the attention is drawn to very special structures, unambiguous
connections between premises and deductions, simple patterns of reasoning, and all the other
structures of language are neglected. These other structures may arise from associations
between certain meanings of words; for instance, a secondary meaning of a word which passes
only vaguely through the mind when the word is heard may contribute essentially to the content
of a sentence. The fact that every word may cause many only half-conscious movements in our
mind can be used to represent some part of reality in the language much more clearly than by
the use of the logical patterns. Therefore, the poets have often objected to this emphasis in
language and in thinking on the logical pattern, which – if I interpret their opinions correctly – can
make language less suitable for its purpose. We may recall for instance the words in Goethe's
Faust which Mephistopheles speaks to the young student (quoted from the translation by Anna
Swanwick):
Waste not your time, so fast it flies; Method will teach you time to
win; Hence, my young friend, I would advise, With college logic to
begin.
Then will your mind be so well brac'd, In Spanish boots so tightly
lac'd,
116
That on 'twill circumspectly creep, Thought's beaten track securely keep,
Nor will it, ignis-fatuus like,
Into the path of error strike.
Then many a day they'll teach you how The mind's spontaneous acts, till
now As eating and as drinking free,
Require a process; — one, two, three! In truth the subtle web of thought Is
like the weaver's fabric wrought, One treadle moves a thousand lines, Swift
dart the shuttles to and fro, Unseen the threads unnumber'd flow, A
thousand knots one stroke combines. Then forward steps your sage to show,
And prove to you it must be so; The first being so, and so the second. The
third and fourth deduc'd we see; And if there were no first and second, Nor
third nor fourth would ever be. This, scholars of all countries prize, Yet 'mong
themselves no weavers rise. Who would describe and study aught alive, Seeks 
first the living spirit thence to drive: Then are the lifeless fragments in his
hand, There only fails, alas! — the spirit-band.
This passage contains an admirable description of the structure of language and of the
narrowness of the simple logical patterns.
On the other hand, science must be based upon language as the only means of
communication and there, where the problem of unambiguity is of greatest importance, the
logical patterns must play their role. The characteristic difficulty at this point may be described in
the following way. In natural science we try to derive the particular from the general, to
understand the particular phenomenon as caused by simple general laws. The general laws when
formulated in the
117
language can contain only a few simple concepts — else the law would not be simple and general.
From these concepts are derived an infinite variety of possible phenomena, not only qualitatively
but with complete precision with respect to every detail. It is obvious that the concepts of
ordinary language, inaccurate and only vaguely defined as they are, could never allow such
derivations. When a chain of conclusions follows from given premises, the number of possible links
in the chain depends on the precision of the premises. Therefore, the concepts of the general
laws must in natural science be defined with complete precision, and this can be achieved only
by means of mathematical abstraction.
In other sciences the situation may be somewhat similar in so far as rather precise definitions
are also required; for instance, in law. But here the number of links in the chain of conclusions
need not be very great, complete precision is not needed, and rather precise definitions in terms
of ordinary language are sufficient.
In theoretical physics we try to understand groups of phenomena by introducing mathematical
symbols that can be correlated with facts, namely, with the results of measurements. For the
symbols we use names that visualize their correlation with the measurement. Thus the symbols are
attached to the language. Then the symbols are interconnected by a rigorous system of
definitions and axioms, and finally the natural laws are expressed as equations between the symbols. The infinite variety of solutions of these equations then corresponds to the infinite variety of
particular phenomena that are possible in this part of nature. In this way the mathematical
scheme represents the group of phenomena so far as the correlation between the symbols and the
measurements goes. It is this correlation which permits the expression of natural laws in the
terms of common language, since our experiments consisting of actions and observations can
always be described in ordinary language.
Still, in the process of expansion of scientific knowledge the language also expands; new terms
are introduced and the old ones are applied in a wider field or differently from ordinary language.
Terms such as `energy,"electricity,"entropy'
 are obvious examples. In this way we develop a
scientific language which may be called a natural
118
extension of ordinary language adapted to the added fields of scientific knowledge.
During the past century a number of new concepts have been introduced in physics, and in
some cases it has taken considerable time before the scientists have really grown accustomed to
their use. The term `electromagnetic field,' for instance, which was to some extent already
present in Faraday's work and which later formed the basis of Maxwell's theory, was not easily
accepted by the physicists, who directed their attention primarily to the mechanical motion of
matter. The introduction of the concept really involved a change in scientific ideas as well, and 
such changes are not easily accomplished.
Still, all the concepts introduced up to the end of the last century formed a perfectly
consistent set applicable to a wide field of experience, and, together with the former concepts,
formed a language which not only the scientists but also the technicians and engineers could
successfully apply in their work. To the underlying fundamental ideas of this language belonged
the assumptions that the order of events in time is entirely independent of their order in space,
that Euclidean geometry is valid in real space, and that the events `happen' in space and time
independently of whether they are observed or not. It was not denied that every observation had
some influence on the phenomenon to be observed but it was generally assumed that by doing
the experiments cautiously this influence could be made arbitrarily small. This seemed in fact a
necessary condition for the ideal of objectivity which was considered as the basis of all natural
science.
Into this rather peaceful state of physics broke quantum theory and the theory of special
relativity as a sudden, at first slow and then gradually increasing, movement in the foundations of
natural science. The first violent discussions developed around the problems of space and time
raised by the theory of relativity. How should one speak about the new situation? Should one
consider the Lorentz contraction of moving bodies as a real contraction or only as an apparent
contraction? Should one say that the structure of space and time was really different from what it
had been assumed to be or should one only say that the experimental results could be connected
mathematically in a way corresponding to this new structure, while space and time, being
119
the universal and necessary mode in which things appear to us, remain what they had always
been? The real problem behind these many controversies was the fact that no language existed
in which one could speak consistently about the new situation. The ordinary language was based
upon the old concepts of space and time and this language offered the only unambiguous means
of communication about the setting up and the results of the measurements. Yet the
experiments showed that the old concepts could not be applied everywhere.
The obvious starting point for the interpretation of the theory of relativity was therefore the
fact that in the limiting case of small velocities (small compared with the velocity of light) the new
theory was practically identical with the old one. Therefore, in this part of the theory it was
obvious in which way the mathematical symbols had to be correlated with the measurements and
with the terms of ordinary language; actually it was only through this correlation that the Lorentz
transformation had been found. There was no ambiguity about the meaning of the words and
the symbols in this region. In fact this correlation was already sufficient for the application of the
theory to the whole field of experimental research connected with the problem of relativity.
Therefore, the controversial questions about the `real' or the `apparent' Lorentz contraction, or
about the definition of the word `
simultaneous'
 etc., did not concern the facts but rather the
language.
With regard to the language, on the other hand, one has gradually recognized that one should
perhaps not insist too much on certain principles. It is always difficult to find general convincing
criteria for which terms should be used in the language and how they should be used. One
should simply wait for the development of the language, which adjusts itself after some time to
the new situation. Actually in the theory of special relativity this adjustment has already taken
place to a large extent during the past fifty years. The distinction between `real' and `apparent'
contraction, for instance, has simply disappeared. The word `simultaneous' is used in line with
the definition given by Einstein, while for the wider definition discussed in an earlier chapter the
term `at a space-like distance' is commonly used, etc.
In the theory of general relativity the idea of a non-Euclidean geometry in real space was
strongly contradicted by some philosophers
120
who pointed out that our whole method of setting up the experiments already presupposed
Euclidean geometry.
In fact if. a mechanic tries to prepare a perfectly plane surface, he can do it in the following
way. He first prepares three surfaces of, roughly, the same size which are, roughly, plane. Then
he tries to bring any two of the three surfaces into contact by putting them against each other in
different relative positions. The degree to which this contact is possible on the whole surface is a
measure of the degree of accuracy with which the surfaces can be called `plane.' He will be
satisfied with his three surfaces only if the contact between any two of them is complete
everywhere. If this happens one can prove mathematically that Euclidean geometry holds on the
three surfaces. In this way, it was argued, Euclidean geometry is just made correct by our own
measures.
From the point of view of general relativity, of course, one can answer that this argument
proves the validity of Euclidean geometry only in small dimensons, in the dimensions of our
experimental equipment. The accuracy with which it holds in this region is so high that the above
process for getting plane surfaces can always be carried out. The extremely slight deviations from
Euclidean geometry which still exist in this region will not be realized since the surfaces are made
of material which is not strictly rigid but allows for very small deformations and since the concept
of `
contact' cannot be defined with complete precision. For surfaces on a cosmic scale the
process that has been described would just not work; but this is not a problem of experimental
physics.
Again, the obvious starting point for the physical interpretation of the mathematical scheme in
general relativity is the fact that the geometry is very nearly Euclidean in small dimensions; the
theory approaches the classical theory in this region. Therefore, here the correlation between the
mathematical symbols and the measurements and the concepts in ordinary language is
unambiguous. Still, one can speak about a non-Euclidean geometry in large dimensions. In fact a
long time before the theory of general relativity had even been developed the possibility of a
non-Euclidean geometry in real space seems to have been considered by the mathematicians,
especially by
121
Gauss in Gottingen. When he carried out very accurate geodetic measurements on a triangle
formed by three mountains – the Brocken in the Harz Mountains, the Inselberg in Thuringia, and
the Hohenhagen near Gottingen – he is said to have checked very carefully whether the sum of
the three angles was actually equal to 18o degrees; and that he considered a difference which
would prove deviations from Euclidean geometry as being possible. Actually he did not find any
deviations within his accuracy of measurement.
In the theory of general relativity the language by which we describe the general laws actually
now follows the scientific language of the mathematicians, and for the description of the
experiments them-selves we can use the ordinary concepts, since Euclidean geometry is valid with
sufficient accuracy in small dimensions.
The most difficult problem, however, concerning the use of the language arises in quantum
theory. Here we have at first no simple guide for correlating the mathematical symbols with
concepts of ordinary language; and the only thing we know from the start is the fact that our
common concepts cannot be applied to the structure of the atoms. Again the obvious starting
point for the physical interpretation of the formalism seems to be the fact that the mathematical
scheme of quantum mechanics approaches that of classical mechanics in dimensions which are
large as compared to the size of the atoms. But even this statement must be made with some
reservations. Even in large dimensions there are many solutions of the quantum-theoretical
equations to which no analogous solutions can be found in classical physics. In these solutions 
the phenomenon of the `interference of probabilities' would show up, as was discussed in the
earlier chapters; it does not exist in classical physics. Therefore, even in the limit of large
dimensions the correlation between the mathematical symbols, the measurements, and the
ordinary concepts is by no means trivial. In order to get to such an unambiguous correlation one
must take another feature of the problem into account. It must be observed that the system which
is treated by the methods of quantum. mechanics is in fact a part of a much bigger system
(eventually the whole world); it is interacting with this bigger system; and one must add that the
microscopic properties of the bigger system are (at least to a large
122
extent) unknown. This statement is undoubtedly a correct description of the actual situation.
Since the system could not be the object of measurements and of theoretical investigations, it
would in fact not belong to the world of phenomena if it had no interactions with such a bigger
system of which the observer is a part. The interaction with the bigger system with its undefined
microscopic properties then introduces a new statistical element into the description – both the
quantum-theoretical and the classical one – of the system under consideration. In the limiting
case of the large dimensions this statistical element destroys the effects of the `
interference of
probabilities' in such a manner that now the quantum-mechanical scheme really approaches the
classical one in the limit. Therefore, at this point the correlation between the mathematical
symbols of quantum theory and the concepts of ordinary language is unambiguous, and this
correlation suffices for the interpretation of the experiments. The remaining problems again
concern the language rather than the facts, since it belongs to the concept `fact' that it can be
described in ordinary language.
But the problems of language here are really serious. We wish to speak in some way about the
structure of the atoms and not only about the `facts' – the latter being, for instance, the black
spots on a photographic plate or the water droplets in a cloud chamber. But we cannot speak
about the atoms in ordinary language.
The analysis can now be carried further in two entirely different ways. We can either ask which
language concerning the atoms has actually developed among the physicists in the thirty years
that have elapsed since the formulation of quantum mechanics. Or we can describe the attempts
for defining a precise scientific language that corresponds to the mathematical scheme.
In answer to the first question one may say that the concept of complementarity introduced by
Bohr into the interpretation of quantum theory has encouraged the physicists to use an
ambiguous rather than an unambiguous language, to use the classical concepts in a somewhat
vague manner in conformity with the principle of uncertainty, to apply alternatively different
classical concepts which would lead to contradictions if used simultaneously. In this way one
123
speaks about electronic orbits, about matter waves and charge density, about energy and
momentum, etc., always conscious of the fact that these concepts have only a very limited range
of applicability. When this vague and unsystematic use of the language leads into difficulties, the
physicist has to withdraw into the mathematical scheme and its unambiguous correlation with the
experimental facts.
This use of the language is in many ways quite satisfactory, since it reminds us of a similar use
of the language in daily life or in poetry. We realize that the situation of complementarity is not
confined to the atomic world alone; we meet it when we reflect about a decision and the motives
for our decision or when we have the choice between enjoying music and analyzing its structure.
On the other hand, when the classical concepts are used in this manner, they always retain a
certain vagueness, they acquire in their relation to `reality' only the same statistical significance
as the concepts of classical thermodynamics in its statistical interpretation. Therefore, a short 
discussion of these statistical concepts of thermodynamics may be useful.
The concept `temperature' in classical thermodynamics seems to describe an objective feature
of reality, an objective property of matter. In daily life it is quite easy to define with the help of a
thermometer what we mean by stating that a piece of matter has a certain temperature. But
when we try to define what the temperature of an atom could mean we are, even in classical
physics, in a much more difficult position. Actually we cannot correlate this concept `temperature
of the atom' with a well-defined property of the atom but have to connect it at least partly with our
insufficient knowledge of it. We can correlate the value of the temperature with certain statistical
expectations about the properties of the atom, but it seems rather doubtful whether an
expectation should be called objective. The concept `temperature of the atom'
 is not much better
defined than the concept `mixing' in the story about the boy who bought mixed sweets.
In a similar way in quantum theory all the classical concepts are, when applied to the atom,
just as well and just as little defined as the `temperature of the atom'; they are correlated with
statistical expectations; only in rare cases may the expectation become the equivalent of
certainty. Again, as in classical thermodynamics, it is
124
difficult to call the expectation objective. One might perhaps call it an objective tendency or
possibility, a `potentia' in the sense of Aristotelian philosophy. In fact, I believe that the language
actually used by physicists when they speak about atomic events produces in their minds similar
notions as the concept `potentia.' So the physicists have gradually become accustomed to
considering the electronic orbits, etc., not as reality but rather as a kind of `potentia.' The
language has already adjusted itself, at least to some extent, to this true situation. But it is not a
precise language in which one could use the normal logical patterns; it is a language that
produces pictures in our mind, but together with them the notion that the pictures have only a
vague connection with reality, that they represent only a tendency toward reality.
The vagueness of this language in use among the physicists has therefore led to attempts to
define a different precise language which follows definite logical patterns in complete conformity
with the mathematical scheme of quantum theory. The result of these attempts by Birkhoff and
Neumann and more recently by Weizsacker can be stated by saying that the mathematical
scheme of quantum theory can be interpreted as an extension or modification of classical logic.
It is especially one fundamental principle of classical logic which seems to require a modification.
In classical logic it is assumed that, if a statement has any meaning at all, either the statement
or the negation of the statement must be correct. Of `here is a table
'
 or `here is not a table,'
either the first or the second statement must be correct. `Tertium non datur,' a third possibility
does not exist. It may be that we do not know whether the statement or its negation is correct;
but in `
reality' one of the. two is correct.
In quantum theory this law `
tertium non datur' is to be modified. Against any modification of
this fundamental principle one can of course at once argue that the principle is assumed in
common language and that we have to speak at least about our eventual modification of logic in
the natural language. Therefore, it would be a self-contradiction to describe in natural language
a logical scheme that does not apply to natural language. There, however, Weizsacker points out
that one may distinguish various levels of language.
125
One level refers to the objects — for instance, to the atoms or the electrons. A second level
refers to statements about objects. A third level may refer to statements about statements about
objects, etc. It would then be possible to have different logical patterns at the different levels. It is
true that finally we have to go back to the natural language and thereby to the classical logical
patterns. But Weizsacker suggests that classical logic may be in a similar manner a priori to 
quantum logic, as classical physics is to quantum theory. Classical logic would then be contained
as a kind of limiting case in quantum logic, but the latter would constitute the more general
logical pattern.
The possible modification of the classical logical pattern shall, then, first refer to the level
concerning the objects. Let us consider an atom moving in a closed box which is divided by a
wall into two equal parts. The wall may have a very small hole so that the atom can go through.
Then the atom can, according to classical logic, be either in the left half of the box or in the right
half. There is no third possibility: `
tertium non datur.' In quantum theory, however, we have to
admit — if we use the words `atom'
 and `box' at all — that there are other possibilities which are
in a strange way mixtures of the two former possibilities. This is necessary for explaining the
results of our experiments. We could, for instance, observe light that has been scattered by the
atom. We could perform three experiments: first the atom is (for instance, by closing the hole in
the wall) confined to the left half of the box, and the intensity distribution of the scattered light is
measured; then it is confined to the right half and again the scattered light is measured; and
finally the atom can move freely in the whole box and again the intensity distribution of the
scattered light is measured. If the atom would always be in either the left half or the right half of
the box, the final intensity distribution should be a mixture (according to the fraction of time
spent by the atom in each of the two parts) of the two former intensity distributions. But this is in
general not true experimentally. The real intensity distribution is modified by the `interference of
probabilities'; this has been discussed before.
In order to cope with this situation Weizsacker has introduced the concept `degree of truth.'
For any simple statement in an alternative
126
like `The atom is in the left (or in the right) half of the box' a complex number is defined as a
measure for its `degree of truth.' If the number is 1, it means that the statement is true; if the
number is o, it means that it is false. But other values are possible. The absolute square of the
complex number gives the probability for the statement's being true; the sum of the two
probabilities referring to the two parts in the alternative (either `left' or `
right'
 in our case) must
be unity. But each pair of complex numbers referring to the two parts of the alternative
represents, according to Weizsacker's definitions, a `statement' which is certainly true if the
numbers have just these values; the two numbers, for instance, are sufficient for determining the
intensity distribution of scattered light in our experiment. If one allows the use of the term
`
statement'
 in this way one can introduce the term `
complementarity' by the following definition:
Each statement that is not identical with either of the two alternative statements — in our case
with the statements: `the atom is in the left half' or `
the atom is in the right half of the box' — is
called complementary to these statements. For each complementary statement the question
whether the atom is left or right is not decided. But the term `not decided' is by no means
equivalent to the term `not known.' `Not known' would mean that the atom is `really' left or
right, only we do not know where it is. But `not decided' indicates a different situation,
expressible only by a complementary statement.
This general logical pattern, the details of which cannot be described here, corresponds precisely
to the mathematical formalism of quantum theory. It forms the basis of a precise language that
can be used to describe the structure of the atom. But the application of such a language raises a
number of difficult problems of which we shall discuss only two here: the relation between the
different `levels' of language and the consequences for the underlying ontology.
In classical logic the relation between the different levels of language is a one-to-one
correspondence. The two statements, `The atom is in the left half'
 and It is true that the atom is
in the left half,' belong logically to different levels. In classical logic these statements are
completely equivalent, i.e., they are either both true or both false. It is not possible that the one
is true and the other false. But in the
127
logical pattern of complementarity this relation is more complicated. The correctness or
incorrectness of the first statement still implies the correctness or incorrectness of the second
statement. But the incorrectness of the second statement does not imply the incorrectness of the
first statement. If the second statement is incorrect, it may be undecided whether the atom is in
the left half; the atom need not necessarily be in the right half. There is still complete
equivalence between the two levels of language with respect to the correctness of a statement,
but not with respect to the incorrectness. From this connection one can understand the
persistence of the classical laws in quantum theory: wherever a definite result can be derived in a
given experiment by the application of the classical laws the result will also follow from quantum
theory, and it will hold experimentally.
The final aim of Weizsacker's attempt is to apply the modified logical patterns also in the
higher levels of language, but these questions cannot be discussed here.
The other problem concerns the ontology that underlies the modified logical patterns. If the
pair of complex numbers represents a `statement' in the sense just described, there should exist
a `state' or a `situation' in nature in which the statement is correct. We will use the word `
state'
in this connection. The `states' corresponding to complementary statements are then called
`
coexistent states' by Weizsacker. This term `coexistent' describes the situation correctly; it
would in fact be difficult to call them `different states,' since every state contains to some extent
also the other `coexistent states.' This concept of `state' would then form a first definition
concerning the ontology of quantum theory. One sees at once that this use of the word `state,'
especially the term `coexistent state,' is so different from the usual materialistic ontology that one
may doubt whether one is using a convenient terminology. On the other hand, if one considers
the word `state' as describing some potentiality rather than a reality — one may even simply
replace the term `state' by the term `potentiality' — then the concept of `
coexistent potentialities'
is quite plausible, since one potentiality may involve or overlap other potentialities.
All these difficult definitions and distinctions can be avoided if one confines the language to the
description of facts, i.e., experimental
128
results. However, if one wishes to speak about the atomic particles themselves one must either
use the mathematical scheme as the only supplement to natural language or one must combine
it with a language that makes use of a modified logic or of no well-defined logic at all. In the
experiments about atomic events we have to do with things and facts, with phenomena that are
just as real as any phenomena in daily life. But the atoms or the elementary particles themselves
are not as real; they form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than one of things or
facts.
