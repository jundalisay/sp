This starts from a paradox. 

Any physics experiment is described in the terms of classical physics.

The concepts of classical physics describe the arrangement of our experiments and state the results.

Yet the application of these concepts is limited by the relations of uncertainty. 

We must keep in mind this limited range of applicability of the classical
concepts while using them, but we cannot and should not try to improve them.
For a better understanding of this paradox it is useful to compare the procedure for the
theoretical interpretation of an experiment in classical physics and in quantum theory. 

In Newton's mechanics, we can measure the position and speed of a planet.

This leads to the planet's:
- co-ordinates
- momenta

Then the equations of motion are used to derive from these values of the coordinates and momenta.

In this way, the astronomer can predict the position of the planet at a later time.

It is different in quantum theory.

We can get the initial position and speed of the electron in a gas chamber.

But this determination will not be accurate.

These inaccuracies lead to the mathematical scheme of quantum theory. 

A probability function represents:
- the experimental situation at the time of the measurement
- the possible errors of the measurement

This probability function represents:


1. A fact 

2. Our knowledge of a fact

The function assigns at the initial time the probability unity (i.e., complete certainty) to the initial situation: the electron moving with the observed velocity at the observed position; 

`observed' means observed within the accuracy of the experiment. 

It represents our knowledge in so far as another observer could perhaps know the position of the electron more accurately. The error in the experiment does – at least to some extent – not represent a property of the electron but a deficiency in our knowledge of the electron. 

This deficiency of knowledge is expressed in the probability function.

In classical physics one should in a careful investigation also consider the error of the
observation. 

As a result one would get a probability distribution for the initial values of the coordinates and velocities and therefore something very similar to the probability function in
quantum mechanics. Only the necessary uncertainty due to the uncertainty relations is lacking in
classical physics.

When the probability function in quantum theory has been deter-mined at the initial time from
the observation, one can from the laws of quantum theory calculate the probability function at
any later time and can thereby determine the probability for a measurement giving a specified
value of the measured quantity. We can, for instance, predict the probability for finding the
electron at a later time at a given point in the cloud chamber. It should be emphasized, however,
that the probability function does not in itself represent a course of events in the course of time.
It represents a tendency for events and our knowledge of events. The probability function can be
connected with reality only if one essential condition is fulfilled: if a new measure1 6
ment is made to determine a certain property of the system. Only then does the probability
function allow us to calculate the probable result of the new measurement. The result of the
measurement again will be stated in terms of classical physics.
Therefore, the theoretical interpretation of an experiment requires three distinct steps: (1) the
translation of the initial experimental situation into a probability function; (2) the following up of
this function in the course of time; (3) the statement of a new measurement to be made of the
system, the result of which can then be calculated from the probability function. For the first step
the fulfillment of the uncertainty relations is a necessary condition. The second step cannot be
described in terms of the classical concepts; there is no description of what happens to the system
between the initial observation and the next measurement. It is only in the third step that we
change over again from the `possible' to the `actual.'
Let us illustrate these three steps in a simple ideal experiment. It has been said that the atom
consists of a nucleus and electrons moving around the nucleus; it has also been stated that the
concept of an electronic orbit is doubtful. One could argue that it should at least in principle be
possible to observe the electron in its orbit. One should simply look at the atom through a
microscope of a very high resolving power, then one would see the electron moving in its orbit.
Such a high resolving power could to be sure not be obtained by a microscope using ordinary light,
since the inaccuracy of the measurement of the position can never be smaller than the wave
length of the light. But a microscope using y-rays with a wave length smaller than the size of the
atom would do. Such a microscrope has not yet been constructed but that should not prevent us
from discussing the ideal experiment.
Is the first step, the translation of the result of the observation into a probability function,
possible? It is possible only if the uncertainty relation is fulfilled after the observation. The
position of the electron will be known with an accuracy given by the wave length of the y-ray. The
electron may have been practically at rest before the observation. But in the act of observation at
least one light quantum of the y-ray must have passed the microscope and must first have been
deflected by the electron. Therefore, the electron has been pushed by the light
1 7
quantum, it has changed its momentum and its velocity, and one can show that the uncertainty
of this change is just big enough to guarantee the validity of the uncertainty relations. Therefore,
there is no difficulty with the first step.
At the same time one can easily see that there is no way of observing the orbit of the electron
around the nucleus. The second step shows a wave pocket moving not around the nucleus but
away from the atom, because the first light quantum will have knocked the electron out from the
atom. The momentum of light quantum of the y-ray is much bigger than the original momentum
of the electron if the wave length of the y-ray is much smaller than the size of the atom.
Therefore, the first light quantum is sufficient to knock the electron out of the atom and one can
never observe more than one point in the orbit of the electron; therefore, there is no orbit in the
ordinary sense. The next observation – the third step – will show the electron on its path from the
atom. Quite generally there is no way of describing what happens between two consecutive
observations. It is of course tempting to say that the electron must have been somewhere
between the two observations and that therefore the electron must have described some kind of
path or orbit even if it may be impossible to . know which path. This would be a reasonable
argument in classical physics. But in quantum theory it would be a misuse of the language which,
as we will see later, cannot be justified. We can leave it open for the moment, whether this
warning is a statement about the way in which we should talk about atomic events or a
statement about the events themselves, whether it refers to epistemology or to ontology. In any
case we have to be very cautious about the wording of any statement concerning the behavior of
atomic particles.
Actually we need not speak of particles at all. For many experiments it is more convenient to
speak of matter waves; for instance, of stationary matter waves around the atomic nucleus. Such
a description would directly contradict the other description if one does not pay attention to the
limitations given by the uncertainty relations. Through the limitations the contradiction is
avoided. The use of `matter waves' is convenient, for example, when dealing with the radiation
emitted by the atom. By means of its frequencies and
intensities the radiation gives information about the oscillating charge distribution in the atom, and
there the wave picture comes much nearer to the truth than the particle picture. Therefore, Bohr
advocated the use of both pictures, which he called `complementary' to each other. The two
pictures are of course mutually exclusive, because a certain thing cannot at the same time be a
particle (i.e., substance confined to a very small volume) and a wave (i.e., a field spread out over
a large space), but the two complement each other. By playing with both pictures, by going from
the one picture to the other and back again, we finally get the right impression of the strange
kind of reality behind our atomic experiments. Bohr uses the concept of `complementarity' at
several places in the interpretation of quantum theory. The knowledge of the position of a
particle is complementary to the knowledge of its velocity or momentum. If we know the one
with high accuracy we cannot know the other with high accuracy; still we must know both for
determining the behavior of the system. The space-time description of the atomic events is
complementary to their deterministic description. The probability function obeys an equation of 
motion as the co-ordinates did in Newtonian mechanics; its change in the course of time is
completely determined by the quantum mechanical equation, but it does not allow a description
in space and time. The observation, on the other hand, enforces the description in space and
time but breaks the determined continuity of the probability function by changing our knowledge
of the system.
Generally the dualism between two different descriptions of the same reality is no longer a difficulty since we know from the mathematical formulation of the theory that contradictions cannot arise. The dualism between the two complementary pictures – waves and particles – is also clearly brought out in the flexibility of the mathematical scheme. The formalism is normally written to resemble Newtonian mechanics, with equations of motion for the co-ordinates and the momenta of the particles. But by a simple transformation it can be rewritten to resemble a wave equation for an ordinary three-dimensional matter wave. Therefore, this possibility of playing with different complementary pictures has its analogy in the different transformations of the mathematical scheme; it does not lead to any
1 9
difficulties in the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory.
A real difficulty in the understanding of this interpretation arises, however, when one asks the
famous question: But what happens `really' in an atomic event? It has been said before that the
mechanism and the results of an observation can always be stated in terms of the classical
concepts. But what one deduces from an observation is a probability function, a mathematical
expression that combines statements about possibilities or tendencies with statements about our
knowledge of facts. So we cannot completely objectify the result of an observation, we cannot
describe what `happens' between this observation and the next. This looks as if we had
introduced an element of subjectivism into the theory, as if we meant to say: what happens
depends on our way of observing it or on the fact that we observe it. Before discussing this
problem of subjectivism it is necessary to explain quite clearly why one would get into hopeless
difficulties if one tried to describe what happens between two consecutive observations.
For this purpose it is convenient to discuss the following ideal experiment: We assume that a
small source of monochromatic light radiates toward a black screen with two small holes in it. The
diameter of the holes may be not much bigger than the wave length of the light, but their distance
will be very much bigger. At some distance behind the screen a photographic plate registers the
incident light. If one describes this experiment in terms of the wave picture, one says that the
primary wave penetrates through the two holes; there will be secondary spherical waves starting
from the holes that interfere with one another, and the interference will produce a pattern of
varying intensity on the photographic plate.
The blackening of the photographic plate is a quantum process, a chemical reaction produced
by single light quanta. Therefore, it must also be possible to describe the experiment in terms of
light quanta. If it would be permissible to say what happens to the single light quantum between
its emission from the light source and its absorption in the photographic plate, one could argue as
follows: The single light quantum can come through the first hole or through the second one. If it
goes through the first hole and is scattered there, its probability
20
for being absorbed at a certain point of the photographic plate cannot depend upon whether the
second hole is closed or open. The probability distribution on the plate will be the same as if
only the first hole was open. If the experiment is repeated many times and one takes together
all cases in which the light quantum has gone through the first hole, the blackening of the plate 
due to these cases will correspond to this probability distribution. If one considers only those light
quanta that go through the second hole, the blackening should correspond to a probability
distribution derived from the assumption that only the second hole is open. The total blackening,
therefore, should just be the sum of the blackenings in the two cases; in other words, there
should be no interference pattern. But we know this is not correct, and the experiment will show
the interference pattern. Therefore, the statement that any light quantum must have gone either
through the first or through the second hole is problematic and leads to contradictions. This
example shows clearly that the concept of the probability function does not allow a description
of what happens between two observations. Any attempt to find such a description would lead
to contradictions; this must mean that the term `happens' is restricted to the observation.
Now, this is a very strange result, since it seems to indicate that the observation plays a
decisive role in the event and that the reality varies, depending upon whether we observe it or
not. To make this point clearer we have to analyze the process of observation more closely.
To begin with, it is important to remember that in natural science we are not interested in the
universe as a whole, including ourselves, but we direct our attention to some part of the universe
and make that the object of our studies. In atomic physics this part is usually a very small
object, an atomic particle or a group of such particles, sometimes much larger—the size does not
matter; but it is important that a large part of the universe, including ourselves, does not belong to
the object.
Now, the theoretical interpretation of an experiment starts with the two steps that have been
discussed. In the first step we have to describe the arrangement of the experiment, eventually
combined
21
with a first observation, in terms of classical physics and translate this description into a probability
function. This probability function follows the laws of quantum theory, and its change in the
course of time, which is continuous, can be calculated from the initial conditions; this is the
second step. The probability function combines objective and subjective elements. It contains
statements about possibilities or better tendencies ('potentia' in Aristotelian philosophy), and
these statements are completely objective, they do not depend on any observer; and it contains
statements about our knowledge of the system, which of course are subjective in so far as they
may be different for different observers. In ideal cases the subjective element in the probability
function may be practically negligible as compared with the objective one. The physicists then
speak of a `pure case.'
When we now come to the next observation, the result of which should be predicted from the
theory, it is very important to realize that our object has to be in contact with the other part of
the world, namely, the experimental arrangement, the measuring rod, etc., before or at least at the
moment of observation. This means that the equation of motion for the probability function does
now contain the influence of the interaction with the measuring device. This influence introduces a
new element of uncertainty, since the measuring device is necessarily described in the terms of
classical physics; such a description contains all the uncertainties concerning the microscopic
structure of the device which we know from thermodynamics, and since the device is connected
with the rest of the world, it contains in fact the uncertainties of the microscopic structure of the
whole world. These uncertainties may be called objective in so far as they are simply a
consequence of the description in the terms of classical physics and do not depend on any
observer. They may be called subjective in so far as they refer to our incomplete knowledge of
the world.
After this interaction has taken place, the probability function contains the objective element of
tendency and the subjective element of incomplete knowledge, even if it has been a `pure case
'
before. It is for this reason that the result of the observation cannot generally be predicted with
certainty; what can be predicted is the probability of a certain result of the observation, and this
statement about the
22
probability can be checked by repeating the experiment many times. The probability function
does — unlike the common procedure in Newtonian mechanics — not describe a certain event
but, at least during the process of observation, a whole ensemble of possible events.
The observation itself changes the probability function discontinuously; it selects of all possible
events the actual one that has taken place. Since through the observation our knowledge of the
system has changed discontinuously, its mathematical representation also has undergone the
discontinuous change and we speak of a `quantum jump.' When the old adage Natura non facit
saltus' is used as a basis for criticism of quantum theory, we can reply that certainly our
knowledge can change suddenly and that this fact justifies the use of the term `quantum jump.'
Therefore, the transition from the `possible' to the `actual'
 takes place during the act of
observation. If we want to describe what happens in an atomic event, we have to realize that the
word `happens' can apply only to the observation, not to the state of affairs between two
observations. It applies to the physical, not the psychical act of observation, and we may say that
the transition from the `possible' to the `actual' takes place as soon as the interaction of the
object with the measuring device, and thereby with the rest of the world, has come into play; it
is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer. The
discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration,
because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its
image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.
To what extent, then, have we finally come to an objective description of the world, especially of
the atomic world? In classical physics science started from the belief — or should one say from the
illusion? — that we could describe the world or at least parts of the world without any reference
to ourselves. This is actually possible to a large extent. We know that the city of London exists
whether we see it or not. It may be said that classical physics is just that idealization in which we
can speak about parts of the world without any reference
23
to ourselves. Its success has led to the general ideal of an objective description of the world.
Objectivity has become the first criterion for the value of any scientific result. Does the
Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory still comply with this ideal? One may perhaps say
that quantum theory corresponds to this ideal as far as possible. Certainly quantum theory does
not contain genuine subjective features, it does not introduce the mind of the physicist as a part
of the atomic event. But it starts from the division of the world into the `object' and the rest of
the world, and from the fact that at least for the rest of the world we use the classical concepts in
our description. This division is arbitrary and historically a direct consequence of our scientific
method; the use of the classical concepts is finally a consequence of the general human way of
thinking. But this is already a reference to ourselves and in so far our description is not completely
objective.
It has been stated in the beginning that the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory
starts with a paradox. It starts from the fact that we describe our experiments in the terms of
classical physics and at the same time from the knowledge that these concepts do not fit nature
accurately. The tension between these two starting points is the root of the statistical character
of quantum theory. Therefore, it has sometimes been suggested that one should depart from the
classical concepts altogether and that a radical change in the concepts used for describing the
experiments might possibly lead back to a nonstatical, completely objective description of nature.
This suggestion, however, rests upon a misunderstanding. The concepts of classical physics
are just a refinement of the concepts of daily life and are an essential part of the language
which forms the basis of all natural science. Our actual situation in science is such that we do use
the classical concepts for the description of the experiments, and it was the problem of quantum 
theory to find theoretical interpretation of the experiments on this basis. There is no use in
discussing what could be done if we were other beings than we are. At this point we have to
realize, as von Weizsacker has put it, that `Nature is earlier than man, but man is earlier than
natural science.' The first part of the sentence justifies classical physics, with its ideal of
complete
24
objectivity. The second part tells us why we cannot escape the paradox of quantum theory,
namely, the necessity of using the classical concepts.
We have to add some comments on the actual procedure in the quantum-theoretical
interpretation of atomic events. It has been said that we always start with a division of the world
into an object, which we are going to study, and the rest of the world, and that this division is to
some extent arbitrary. It should indeed not make any difference in the final result if we, e.g., add
some part of the measuring device or the whole device to the object and apply the laws of
quantum theory to this more complicated object. It can be shown that such an alteration of the
theoretical treatment would not alter the predictions concerning a given experiment. This follows
mathematically from the fact that the laws of quantum theory are for the phenomena in which
Planck's constant can be considered as a very small quantity, approximately identical with the
classical laws. But it would be a mistake to believe that this application of the quantumtheoretical laws to the measuring device could help to avoid the fundamental paradox of
quantum theory.
The measuring device deserves this name only if it is in close contact with the rest of the world, if
there is an interaction between the device and the observer. Therefore, the uncertainty with
respect to the microscopic behavior of the world will enter into the quantum-theoretical system
here just as well as in the first interpretation. If the measuring device would be isolated from the
rest of the world, it would be neither a measuring device nor could it be described in the terms of
classical physics at all.
With regard to this situation Bohr has emphasized that it is more realistic to state that the
division into the object and the rest of the world is not arbitrary. Our actual situation in research
work in atomic physics is usually this: we wish to understand a certain phenomenon, we wish to
recognize how this phenomenon follows from the general laws of nature. Therefore, that part of
matter or radiation which takes part in the phenomenon is the natural `object' in the theoretical
treatment and should be separated in this respect from the tools used to study the phenomenon.
This again emphasizes a subjective element
25
in the description of atomic events, since the measuring device has been constructed by the
observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature
exposed to our method of questioning. Our scientific work in physics consists in asking questions
about nature in the language that we possess and trying to get an answer from experiment by
the means that are at our disposal. In this way quantum theory reminds us, as Bohr has put it, of
the old wisdom that when searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama
of existence we are ourselves both players and spectators. It is understandable that in our
scientific relation to nature our own activity becomes very important when we have to deal with
parts of nature into which we can penetrate only by using the most elaborate tools.
