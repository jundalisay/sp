A body determined by its own boundary must be either hard or soft.
- It either yields or does not. 

It must also be concrete or else it could not be so determined. 

Everything that is determined and solid is either hard or soft.
- These qualities are due to concretion, all composite and determined bodies must involve concretion. Concretion therefore must be discussed.

There are 2 causes besides matter:

1. The agent

This is the efficient cause

2. The quality brought about

This is the formal cause. 

Hence concretion and disaggregation, drying and moistening, must have these 2 causes. 

But since concretion is a form of drying let us speak of the latter first. 

The agent operates through 2 qualities.

The patient is acted on in virtue of 2 qualities.

Action takes place by means of heat or cold, and the quality is produced either by the presence or by the absence of heat or cold; but that which is acted upon is moist or dry or a compound of both. 

Water is the element characterized by the moist, earth that characterized by the dry, for these among the elements that admit the qualities moist and dry are passive. 

Therefore cold, too, being found in water and earth (both of which we recognize to be cold), must be reckoned rather as a passive quality. 

It is active only as contributing to destruction or incidentally in the manner described before; for cold is sometimes actually said to burn and to warm, but not in the same way as heat does, but by collecting and concentrating heat.

The subjects of drying are water and the various watery fluids and those bodies which contain water either foreign or connatural. By foreign I mean like the water in wool, by connatural, like that in milk. 

The watery fluids are wine, urine, whey, and in general those fluids which have no sediment or only a little, except where this absence of sediment is due to viscosity. For in some cases, in oil and pitch for instance, it is the viscosity which prevents any sediment from appearing.

A process of heating or cooling dries things.

But the agent in both cases is heat, either internal or external. 

Even when things are dried by cooling, like a garment, where the moisture exists separately it is the internal heat that dries them. It carries off the moisture in the shape of vapour (if there is not too much of it), being itself driven out by the surrounding cold. 

So everything is dried, as we have said, by a process either of heating or cooling, but the agent is always heat, either internal or external, carrying off the moisture in vapour. By external heat I mean as where things are boiled: by internal where the heat breathes out and takes away and uses up its moisture.
