What are the forms taken by the passive qualities the moist and the dry.

The elements of bodies, that is, the passive ones, are the moist and the dry; the bodies themselves are compounded of
them and whichever predominates determines the nature of the body;
thus some bodies partake more of the dry, others of the moist. All
the forms to be described will exist either actually, or potentially
and in their opposite: for instance, there is actual melting and on
the other hand that which admits of being melted. 

Since the moist is easily determined and the dry determined with difficulty,
their relation to one another is like that of a dish and its condiments.

The moist is what makes the dry determinable, and each serves as a
sort of glue to the other-as Empedocles said in his poem on Nature,
'glueing meal together by means of water.' Thus the determined body
involves them both. Of the elements earth is especially representative
of the dry, water of the moist, and therefore all determinate bodies
in our world involve earth and water. Every body shows the quality
of that element which predominates in it. It is because earth and
water are the material elements of all bodies that animals live in
them alone and not in air or fire. 

Of the qualities of bodies hardness and softness are those which must
primarily belong to a determined thing, for anything made up of the
dry and the moist is necessarily either hard or soft. Hard is that
the surface of which does not yield into itself; soft that which does
yield but not by interchange of place: water, for instance, is not
soft, for its surface does not yield to pressure or sink in but there
is an interchange of place. Those things are absolutely hard and soft
which satisfy the definition absolutely, and those things relatively
so which do so compared with another thing. Now relatively to one
another hard and soft are indefinable, because it is a matter of degree,
but since all the objects of sense are determined by reference to
the faculty of sense it is clearly the relation to touch which determines
that which is hard and soft absolutely, and touch is that which we
use as a standard or mean. So we call that which exceeds it hard and
that which falls short of it soft. 

Part 5

A body determined by its own boundary must be either hard or soft;
for it either yields or does not. 

It must also be concrete: or it could not be so determined. So since
everything that is determined and solid is either hard or soft and
these qualities are due to concretion, all composite and determined
bodies must involve concretion. Concretion therefore must be discussed.

Now there are two causes besides matter, the agent and the quality
brought about, the agent being the efficient cause, the quality the
formal cause. Hence concretion and disaggregation, drying and moistening,
must have these two causes. 

But since concretion is a form of drying let us speak of the latter
first. 

As we have explained, the agent operates by means of two qualities
and the patient is acted on in virtue of two qualities: action takes
place by means of heat or cold, and the quality is produced either
by the presence or by the absence of heat or cold; but that which
is acted upon is moist or dry or a compound of both. Water is the
element characterized by the moist, earth that characterized by the
dry, for these among the elements that admit the qualities moist and
dry are passive. Therefore cold, too, being found in water and earth
(both of which we recognize to be cold), must be reckoned rather as
a passive quality. It is active only as contributing to destruction
or incidentally in the manner described before; for cold is sometimes
actually said to burn and to warm, but not in the same way as heat
does, but by collecting and concentrating heat. 

The subjects of drying are water and the various watery fluids and
those bodies which contain water either foreign or connatural. By
foreign I mean like the water in wool, by connatural, like that in
milk. The watery fluids are wine, urine, whey, and in general those
fluids which have no sediment or only a little, except where this
absence of sediment is due to viscosity. For in some cases, in oil
and pitch for instance, it is the viscosity which prevents any sediment
from appearing. 

It is always a process of heating or cooling that dries things, but
the agent in both cases is heat, either internal or external. For
even when things are dried by cooling, like a garment, where the moisture
exists separately it is the internal heat that dries them. It carries
off the moisture in the shape of vapour (if there is not too much
of it), being itself driven out by the surrounding cold. So everything
is dried, as we have said, by a process either of heating or cooling,
but the agent is always heat, either internal or external, carrying
off the moisture in vapour. By external heat I mean as where things
are boiled: by internal where the heat breathes out and takes away
and uses up its moisture. So much for drying.
