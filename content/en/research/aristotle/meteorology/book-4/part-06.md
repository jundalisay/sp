Liquefaction is, first, condensation into water; second, the melting
of a solidified body. The first, condensation, is due to the cooling
of vapour: what melting is will appear from the account of solidification.

Whatever solidifies is either water or a mixture of earth and water,
and the agent is either dry heat or cold. Hence those of the bodies
solidified by heat or cold which are soluble at all are dissolved
by their opposites. Bodies solidified by the dry-hot are dissolved
by water, which is the moist-cold, while bodies solidified by cold
are dissolved by fire, which is hot. Some things seem to be solidified
by water, e.g. boiled honey, but really it is not the water but the
cold in the water which effects the solidification. Aqueous bodies
are not solidified by fire: for it is fire that dissolves them, and
the same cause in the same relation cannot have opposite effects upon
the same thing. Again, water solidifies owing to the departure of
heat; so it will clearly be dissolved by the entry into it of heat:
cold, therefore, must be the agent in solidifying it. 

Hence aqueous bodies do not thicken when they solidify; for thickening
occurs when the moisture goes off and the dry matter comes together,
but water is the only liquid that does not thicken. Those bodies that
are made up of both earth and water are solidified both by fire and
by cold and in either case are thickened. The operation of the two
is in a way the same and in a way different. Heat acts by drawing
off the moisture, and as the moisture goes off in vapour the dry matter
thickens and collects. Cold acts by driving out the heat, which is
accompanied by the moisture as this goes off in vapour with it. Bodies
that are soft but not liquid do not thicken but solidify when the
moisture leaves them, e.g. potter's clay in process of baking: but
those mixed bodies that are liquid thicken besides solidifying, like
milk. Those bodies which have first been thickened or hardened by
cold often begin by becoming moist: thus potter's clay at first in
the process of baking steams and grows softer, and is liable to distortion
in the ovens for that reason. 

Now of the bodies solidified by cold which are made up both of earth
and water but in which the earth preponderates, those which solidify
by the departure of heat melt by heat when it enters into them again;
this is the case with frozen mud. But those which solidify by refrigeration,
where all the moisture has gone off in vapour with the heat, like
iron and horn, cannot be dissolved except by excessive heat, but they
can be softened-though manufactured iron does melt, to the point of
becoming fluid and then solidifying again. This is how steel is made.
The dross sinks to the bottom and is purged away: when this has been
done often and the metal is pure we have steel. The process is not
repeated often because the purification of the metal involves great
waste and loss of weight. But the iron that has less dross is the
better iron. The stone pyrimachus, too, melts and forms into drops
and becomes fluid; after having been in a fluid state it solidifies
and becomes hard again. Millstones, too, melt and become fluid: when
the fluid mass begins to solidify it is black but its consistency
comes to be like that of lime. and earth, too 

Of the bodies which are solidified by dry heat some are insoluble,
others are dissolved by liquid. Pottery and some kinds of stone that
are formed out of earth burnt up by fire, such as millstones, cannot
be dissolved. Natron and salt are soluble by liquid, but not all liquid
but only such as is cold. Hence water and any of its varieties melt
them, but oil does not. For the opposite of the dry-hot is the cold-moist
and what the one solidified the other will dissolve, and so opposites
will have opposite effects.
