Sometimes on a fine night we see a variety of appearances that form in the sky: 'chasms' for instance and 'trenches' and blood-red colours.

These, too, have the same cause. For we have seen that the upper air condenses into an inflammable condition and that the combustion sometimes
takes on the appearance of a burning flame, sometimes that of moving
torches and stars. So it is not surprising that this same air when
condensing should assume a variety of colours. For a weak light shining
through a dense air, and the air when it acts as a mirror, will cause
all kinds of colours to appear, but especially crimson and purple.
For these colours generally appear when fire-colour and white are
combined by superposition. Thus on a hot day, or through a smoky,
medium, the stars when they rise and set look crimson. The light will
also create colours by reflection when the mirror is such as to reflect
colour only and not shape. 

These appearances do not persist long, because the condensation of
the air is transient. 

'Chasms' get their appearance of depth from light breaking out of
a dark blue or black mass of air. When the process of condensation
goes further in such a case we often find 'torches' ejected. When
the 'chasm' contracts it presents the appearance of a 'trench'.

In general, white in contrast with black creates a variety of colours;
like flame, for instance, through a medium of smoke. But by day the
sun obscures them, and, with the exception of crimson, the colours
are not seen at night because they are dark. 

These then must be taken to be the causes of 'shooting-stars' and
the phenomena of combustion and also of the other transient appearances
of this kind. 

Part 6

Let us go on to explain the nature of comets and the 'milky way',
after a preliminary discussion of the views of others. 

Anaxagoras and Democritus declare that comets are a conjunction of
the planets approaching one another and so appearing to touch one
another. 

Some of the Italians called Pythagoreans say that the comet is one
of the planets, but that it appears at great intervals of time and
only rises a little above the horizon. This is the case with Mercury
too; because it only rises a little above the horizon it often fails
to be seen and consequently appears at great intervals of time.

A view like theirs was also expressed by Hippocrates of Chios and
his pupil Aeschylus. Only they say that the tail does not belong to
the comet iself, but is occasionally assumed by it on its course in
certain situations, when our sight is reflected to the sun from the
moisture attracted by the comet. It appears at greater intervals than
the other stars because it is slowest to get clear of the sun and
has been left behind by the sun to the extent of the whole of its
circle before it reappears at the same point. It gets clear of the
sun both towards the north and towards the south. In the space between
the tropics it does not draw water to itself because that region is
dried up by the sun on its course. When it moves towards the south
it has no lack of the necessary moisture, but because the segment
of its circle which is above the horizon is small, and that below
it many times as large, it is impossible for the sun to be reflected
to our sight, either when it approaches the southern tropic, or at
the summer solstice. Hence in these regions it does not develop a
tail at all. But when it is visible in the north it assumes a tail
because the arc above the horizon is large and that below it small.
For under these circumstances there is nothing to prevent our vision
from being reflected to the sun. 

These views involve impossibilities, some of which are common to all
of them, while others are peculiar to some only. 

This is the case, first, with those who say that the comet is one
of the planets. For all the planets appear in the circle of the zodiac,
whereas many comets have been seen outside that circle. Again more
comets than one have often appeared simultaneously. Besides, if their
tail is due to reflection, as Aeschylus and Hippocrates say, this
planet ought sometimes to be visible without a tail since, as they
it does not possess a tail in every place in which it appears. But,
as a matter of fact, no planet has been observed besides the five.
And all of them are often visible above the horizon together at the
same time. Further, comets are often found to appear, as well when
all the planets are visible as when some are not, but are obscured
by the neighbourhood of the sun. Moreover the statement that a comet
only appears in the north, with the sun at the summer solstice, is
not true either. The great comet which appeared at the time of the
earthquake in Achaea and the tidal wave rose due west; and many have
been known to appear in the south. Again in the archonship of Euclees,
son of Molon, at Athens there appeared a comet in the north in the
month Gamelion, the sun being about the winter solstice. Yet they
themselves admit that reflection over so great a space is an impossibility.

An objection that tells equally against those who hold this theory
and those who say that comets are a coalescence of the planets is,
first, the fact that some of the fixed stars too get a tail. For this
we must not only accept the authority of the Egyptians who assert
it, but we have ourselves observed the fact. For a star in the thigh
of the Dog had a tail, though a faint one. If you fixed your sight
on it its light was dim, but if you just glanced at it, it appeared
brighter. Besides, all the comets that have been seen in our day have
vanished without setting, gradually fading away above the horizon;
and they have not left behind them either one or more stars. For instance
the great comet we mentioned before appeared to the west in winter
in frosty weather when the sky was clear, in the archonship of Asteius.
On the first day it set before the sun and was then not seen. On the
next day it was seen, being ever so little behind the sun and immediately
setting. But its light extended over a third part of the sky like
a leap, so that people called it a 'path'. This comet receded as far
as Orion's belt and there dissolved. Democritus however, insists upon
the truth of his view and affirms that certain stars have been seen
when comets dissolve. But on his theory this ought not to occur occasionally
but always. Besides, the Egyptians affirm that conjunctions of the
planets with one another, and with the fixed stars, take place, and
we have ourselves observed Jupiter coinciding with one of the stars
in the Twins and hiding it, and yet no comet was formed. Further,
we can also give a rational proof of our point. It is true that some
stars seem to be bigger than others, yet each one by itself looks
indivisible. Consequently, just as, if they really had been indivisible,
their conjunction could not have created any greater magnitude, so
now that they are not in fact indivisible but look as if they were,
their conjunction will not make them look any bigger. 

Enough has been said, without further argument, to show that the causes
brought forward to explain comets are false.
