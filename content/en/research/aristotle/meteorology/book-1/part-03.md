I will first recall my original principles and then explain the 'milky way' and comets and the other phenomena akin to these. 

Fire, air, water, earth, we assert, originate from one another, and
each of them exists potentially in each, as all things do that can
be resolved into a common and ultimate substrate. 

The first difficulty is raised by what is called the air. What are
we to take its nature to be in the world surrounding the earth? And
what is its position relatively to the other physical elements. (For
there is no question as to the relation of the bulk of the earth to
the size of the bodies which exist around it, since astronomical demonstrations
have by this time proved to us that it is actually far smaller than
some individual stars. As for the water, it is not observed to exist
collectively and separately, nor can it do so apart from that volume
of it which has its seat about the earth: the sea, that is, and rivers,
which we can see, and any subterranean water that may be hidden from
our observation.) The question is really about that which lies between
the earth and the nearest stars. Are we to consider it to be one kind
of body or more than one? And if more than one, how many are there
and what are the bounds of their regions? 

We have already described and characterized the first element, and
explained that the whole world of the upper motions is full of that
body. 

This is an opinion we are not alone in holding: it appears to be an
old assumption and one which men have held in the past, for the word
ether has long been used to denote that element. Anaxagoras, it is
true, seems to me to think that the word means the same as fire. For
he thought that the upper regions were full of fire, and that men
referred to those regions when they spoke of ether. In the latter
point he was right, for men seem to have assumed that a body that
was eternally in motion was also divine in nature; and, as such a
body was different from any of the terrestrial elements, they determined
to call it 'ether'. 

For the um opinions appear in cycles among men not once nor twice,
but infinitely often. 

Now there are some who maintain that not only the bodies in motion
but that which contains them is pure fire, and the interval between
the earth and the stars air: but if they had considered what is now
satisfactorily established by mathematics, they might have given up
this puerile opinion. For it is altogether childish to suppose that
the moving bodies are all of them of a small size, because they so
to us, looking at them from the earth. 

This a matter which we have already discussed in our treatment of
the upper region, but we may return to the point now. 

If the intervals were full of fire and the bodies consisted of fire
every one of the other elements would long ago have vanished.

However, they cannot simply be said to be full of air either; for
even if there were two elements to fill the space between the earth
and the heavens, the air would far exceed the quantitu required to
maintain its proper proportion to the other elements. For the bulk
of the earth (which includes the whole volume of water) is infinitesimal
in comparison with the whole world that surrounds it. Now we find
that the excess in volume is not proportionately great where water
dissolves into air or air into fire. Whereas the proportion between
any given small quantity of water and the air that is generated from
it ought to hold good between the total amount of air and the total
amount of water. Nor does it make any difference if any one denies
that the elements originate from one another, but asserts that they
are equal in power. For on this view it is certain amounts of each
that are equal in power, just as would be the case if they actually
originated from one another. 

So it is clear that neither air nor fire alone fills the intermediate
space. 

It remains to explain, after a preliminary discussion of difficulties,
the relation of the two elements air and fire to the position of the
first element, and the reason why the stars in the upper region impart
heat to the earth and its neighbourhood. Let us first treat of the
air, as we proposed, and then go on to these questions. 

Since water is generated from air, and air from water, why are clouds
not formed in the upper air? They ought to form there the more, the
further from the earth and the colder that region is. For it is neither
appreciably near to the heat of the stars, nor to the rays relected
from the earth. It is these that dissolve any formation by their heat
and so prevent clouds from forming near the earth. For clouds gather
at the point where the reflected rays disperse in the infinity of
space and are lost. To explain this we must suppose either that it
is not all air which water is generated, or, if it is produced from
all air alike, that what immediately surrounds the earth is not mere
air, but a sort of vapour, and that its vaporous nature is the reason
why it condenses back to water again. But if the whole of that vast
region is vapour, the amount of air and of water will be disproportionately
great. For the spaces left by the heavenly bodies must be filled by
some element. This cannot be fire, for then all the rest would have
been dried up. Consequently, what fills it must be air and the water
that surrounds the whole earth-vapour being water dissolved.

After this exposition of the difficulties involved, let us go on to
lay down the truth, with a view at once to what follows and to what
has already been said. The upper region as far as the moon we affirm
to consist of a body distinct both from fire and from air, but varying
degree of purity and in kind, especially towards its limit on the
side of the air, and of the world surrounding the earth. Now the circular
motion of the first element and of the bodies it contains dissolves,
and inflames by its motion, whatever part of the lower world is nearest
to it, and so generates heat. From another point of view we may look
at the motion as follows. The body that lies below the circular motion
of the heavens is, in a sort, matter, and is potentially hot, cold,
dry, moist, and possessed of whatever other qualities are derived
from these. But it actually acquires or retains one of these in virtue
of motion or rest, the cause and principle of which has already been
explained. So at the centre and round it we get earth and water, the
heaviest and coldest elements, by themselves; round them and contiguous
with them, air and what we commonly call fire. It is not really fire,
for fire is an excess of heat and a sort of ebullition; but in reality,
of what we call air, the part surrounding the earth is moist and warm,
because it contains both vapour and a dry exhalation from the earth.
But the next part, above that, is warm and dry. For vapour is naturally
moist and cold, but the exhalation warm and dry; and vapour is potentially
like water, the exhalation potentially like fire. So we must take
the reason why clouds are not formed in the upper region to be this:
that it is filled not with mere air but rather with a sort of fire.

However, it may well be that the formation of clouds in that upper
region is also prevented by the circular motion. For the air round
the earth is necessarily all of it in motion, except that which is
cut off inside the circumference which makes the earth a complete
sphere. In the case of winds it is actually observable that they originate
in marshy districts of the earth; and they do not seem to blow above
the level of the highest mountains. It is the revolution of the heaven
which carries the air with it and causes its circular motion, fire
being continuous with the upper element and air with fire. Thus its
motion is a second reason why that air is not condensed into water.

But whenever a particle of air grows heavy, the warmth in it is squeezed
out into the upper region and it sinks, and other particles in turn
are carried up together with the fiery exhalation. Thus the one region
is always full of air and the other of fire, and each of them is perpetually
in a state of change. 

So much to explain why clouds are not formed and why the air is not
condensed into water, and what account must be given of the space
between the stars and the earth, and what is the body that fills it.

As for the heat derived from the sun, the right place for a special
and scientific account of it is in the treatise about sense, since
heat is an affection of sense, but we may now explain how it can be
produced by the heavenly bodies which are not themselves hot.

We see that motion is able to dissolve and inflame the air; indeed,
moving bodies are often actually found to melt. Now the sun's motion
alone is sufficient to account for the origin of terrestrial warmth
and heat. For a motion that is to have this effect must be rapid and
near, and that of the stars is rapid but distant, while that of the
moon is near but slow, whereas the sun's motion combines both conditions
in a sufficient degree. That most heat should be generated where the
sun is present is easy to understand if we consider the analogy of
terrestrial phenomena, for here, too, it is the air that is nearest
to a thing in rapid motion which is heated most. This is just what
we should expect, as it is the nearest air that is most dissolved
by the motion of a solid body. 

This then is one reason why heat reaches our world. Another is that
the fire surrounding the air is often scattered by the motion of the
heavens and driven downwards in spite of itself. 

Shooting-stars further suffix to prove that the celestial sphere is
not hot or fiery: for they do not occur in that upper region but below:
yet the more and the faster a thing moves, the more apt it is to take
fire. Besides, the sun, which most of all the stars is considered
to be hot, is really white and not fiery in colour.
