Let us go on to treat of the region which follows next in order after
this and which immediately surrounds the earth. It is the region common
to water and air, and the processes attending the formation of water
above take place in it. 

We must consider the principles and causes
of all these phenomena too as before. The efficient and chief and
first cause is the circle in which the sun moves. For the sun as it
approaches or recedes, obviously causes dissipation and condensation
and so gives rise to generation and destruction. 

The earth remains but the moisture surrounding it is made to evaporate by the sun's
rays and the other heat from above, and rises. But when the heat which
was raising it leaves it, in part dispersing to the higher region,
in part quenched through rising so far into the upper air, then the
vapour cools because its heat is gone and because the place is cold,
and condenses again and turns from air into water. And after the water
has formed it falls down again to the earth. 

The exhalation of water is vapour: air condensing into water is cloud.
Mist is what is left over when a cloud condenses into water, and is
therefore rather a sign of fine weather than of rain; for mist might
be called a barren cloud. So we get a circular process that follows
the course of the sun. For according as the sun moves to this side
or that, the moisture in this process rises or falls. We must think
of it as a river flowing up and down in a circle and made up partly
of air, partly of water. When the sun is near, the stream of vapour
flows upwards; when it recedes, the stream of water flows down: and
the order of sequence, at all events, in this process always remains
the same. So if 'Oceanus' had some secret meaning in early writers,
perhaps they may have meant this river that flows in a circle about
the earth. 

So the moisture is always raised by the heat and descends to the earth
again when it gets cold. These processes and, in some cases, their
varieties are distinguished by special names. When the water falls
in small drops it is called a drizzle; when the drops are larger it
is rain. 


## Part 10

Some of the vapour that is formed by day does not rise high because
the ratio of the fire that is raising it to the water that is being
raised is small. When this cools and descends at night it is called
dew and hoar-frost. When the vapour is frozen before it has condensed
to water again it is hoar-frost; and this appears in winter and is
commoner in cold places. It is dew when the vapour has condensed into
water and the heat is not so great as to dry up the moisture that
has been raised nor the cold sufficient (owing to the warmth of the
climate or season) for the vapour itself to freeze. For dew is more
commonly found when the season or the place is warm, whereas the opposite,
as has been said, is the case with hoar-frost. For obviously vapour
is warmer than water, having still the fire that raised it: consequently
more cold is needed to freeze it. 

Both dew and hoar-frost are found when the sky is clear and there
is no wind. For the vapour could not be raised unless the sky were
clear, and if a wind were blowing it could not condense.

The fact that hoar-frost is not found on mountains contributes to
prove that these phenomena occur because the vapour does not rise
high. One reason for this is that it rises from hollow and watery
places, so that the heat that is raising it, bearing as it were too
heavy a burden cannot lift it to a great height but soon lets it fall
again. A second reason is that the motion of the air is more pronounced
at a height, and this dissolves a gathering of this kind.

Everywhere, except in Pontus, dew is found with south winds and not
with north winds. There the opposite is the case and it is found with
north winds and not with south. The reason is the same as that which
explains why dew is found in warm weather and not in cold. For the
south wind brings warm, and the north, wintry weather. For the north
wind is cold and so quenches the heat of the evaporation. But in Pontus
the south wind does not bring warmth enough to cause evaporation,
whereas the coldness of the north wind concentrates the heat by a
sort of recoil, so that there is more evaporation and not less. This
is a thing which we can often observe in other places too. Wells,
for instance, give off more vapour in a north than in a south wind.
Only the north winds quench the heat before any considerable quantity
of vapour has gathered, while in a south wind the evaporation is allowed
to accumulate. 

Water, once formed, does not freeze on the surface of the earth, in
the way that it does in the region of the clouds.
