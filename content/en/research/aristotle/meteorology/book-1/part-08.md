What is the origin, cause, and nature of the milky way?

(1) Of the so-called Pythagoreans some say that this is the path of one of the stars that fell from heaven at the time of Phaethon's downfall.

Others say that the sun used once to move in this circle and that this region was scorched or met with some other affection of this
kind, because of the sun and its motion.  

But it is absurd not to see that if this were the reason the circle
of the Zodiac ought to be affected in the same way, and indeed more
so than that of the milky way, since not the sun only but all the
planets move in it. We can see the whole of this circle (half of it
being visible at any time of the night), but it shows no signs of
any such affection except where a part of it touches the circle of
the milky way. 

(2) Anaxagoras, Democritus, and their schools say that the milky way
is the light of certain stars. For, they say, when the sun passes
below the earth some of the stars are hidden from it. Now the light
of those on which the sun shines is invisible, being obscured by the
of the sun. But the milky way is the peculiar light of those stars
which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays. 

This, too, is obviously impossible. The milky way is always unchanged
and among the same constellations (for it is clearly a greatest circle),
whereas, since the sun does not remain in the same place, what is
hidden from it differs at different times. Consequently with the change
of the sun's position the milky way ought to change its position too:
but we find that this does not happen. Besides, if astronomical demonstrations
are correct and the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth
and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than
that of the sun (just as the sun is further from the earth than the
moon), then the cone made by the rays of the sun would terminate at
no great distance from the earth, and the shadow of the earth (what
we call night) would not reach the stars. On the contrary, the sun
shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.

(3) There is a third theory about the milky way. Some say that it
is a reflection of our sight to the sun, just as they say that the
comet is. 

But this too is impossible. For if the eye and the mirror and the
whole of the object were severally at rest, then the same part of
the image would appear at the same point in the mirror. But if the
mirror and the object move, keeping the same distance from the eye
which is at rest, but at different rates of speed and so not always
at the same interval from one another, then it is impossible for the
same image always to appear in the same part of the mirror. Now the
constellations included in the circle of the milky way move; and so
does the sun, the object to which our sight is reflected; but we stand
still. And the distance of those two from us is constant and uniform,
but their distance from one another varies. For the Dolphin sometimes
rises at midnight, sometimes in the morning. But in each case the
same parts of the milky way are found near it. But if it were a reflection
and not a genuine affection of these this ought not to be the case.

Again, we can see the milky way reflected at night in water and similar
mirrors. But under these circumstances it is impossible for our sight
to be reflected to the sun. 

These considerations show that the milky way is not the path of one
of the planets, nor the light of imperceptible stars, nor a reflection.
And those are the chief theories handed down by others hitherto.

Let us recall our fundamental principle and then explain our views.
We have already laid down that the outermost part of what is called
the air is potentially fire and that therefore when the air is dissolved
by motion, there is separated off a kind of matter-and of this matter
we assert that comets consist. We must suppose that what happens is
the same as in the case of the comets when the matter does not form
independently but is formed by one of the fixed stars or the planets.
Then these stars appear to be fringed, because matter of this kind
follows their course. In the same way, a certain kind of matter follows
the sun, and we explain the halo as a reflection from it when the
air is of the right constitution. Now we must assume that what happens
in the case of the stars severally happens in the case of the whole
of the heavens and all the upper motion.

For it is natural to suppose
that, if the motion of a single star excites a flame, that of all
the stars should have a similar result, and especially in that region
in which the stars are biggest and most numerous and nearest to one
another. Now the circle of the zodiac dissolves this kind of matter
because of the motion of the sun and the planets, and for this reason
most comets are found outside the tropic circles. Again, no fringe
appears round the sun or moon: for they dissolve such matter too quickly
to admit of its formation. But this circle in which the milky way
appears to our sight is the greatest circle, and its position is such
that it extends far outside the tropic circles. 

Besides the region
is full of the biggest and brightest constellations and also of what
called 'scattered' stars (you have only to look to see this clearly).
So for these reasons all this matter is continually and ceaselessly
collecting there. A proof of the theory is this: In the circle itself
the light is stronger in that half where the milky way is divided,
and in it the constellations are more numerous and closer to one another
than in the other half; which shows that the cause of the light is
the motion of the constellations and nothing else. For if it is found
in the circle in which there are most constellations and at that point
in the circle at which they are densest and contain the biggest and
the most stars, it is natural to suppose that they are the true cause
of the affection in question. The circle and the constellations in
it may be seen in the diagram. 

The so-called 'scattered' stars it
is not possible to set down in the same way on the sphere because
none of them have an evident permanent position; but if you look up
to the sky the point is clear. For in this circle alone are the intervals
full of these stars: in the other circles there are obvious gaps.
Hence if we accept the cause assigned for the appearance of comets
as plausible we must assume that the same kind of thing holds good
of the milky way. For the fringe which in the former case is an affection
of a single star here forms in the same way in relation to a whole
circle. So if we are to define the milky way we may call it 'a fringe
attaching to the greatest circle, and due to the matter secreted'.
This, as we said before, explains why there are few comets and why
they appear rarely; it is because at each revolution of the heavens
this matter has always been and is always being separated off and
gathered into this region. 

We have now explained the phenomena that occur in that part of the
terrestrial world which is continuous with the motions of the heavens,
namely, shooting-stars and the burning flame, comets and the milky
way, these being the chief affections that appear in that region.
