The same parts of the earth are not always moist or dry, but they
change according as rivers come into existence and dry up. And so
the relation of land to sea changes too and a place does not always
remain land or sea throughout all time, but where there was dry land
there comes to be sea, and where there is now sea, there one day comes
to be dry land. But we must suppose these changes to follow some order
and cycle. 

The principle and cause of these changes is that the interior of the earth grows and decays, like the bodies of plants and animals.
Only in the case of these latter the process does not go on by parts,
but each of them necessarily grows or decays as a whole, whereas it
does go on by parts in the case of the earth. Here the causes are
cold and heat, which increase and diminish on account of the sun and
its course. It is owing to them that the parts of the earth come to
have a different character, that some parts remain moist for a certain
time, and then dry up and grow old, while other parts in their turn
are filled with life and moisture. Now when places become drier the
springs necessarily give out, and when this happens the rivers first
decrease in size and then finally become dry; and when rivers change
and disappear in one part and come into existence correspondingly
in another, the sea must needs be affected. 

If the sea was once pushed out by rivers and encroached upon the land
anywhere, it necessarily leaves that place dry when it recedes; again,
if the dry land has encroached on the sea at all by a process of silting
set up by the rivers when at their full, the time must come when this
place will be flooded again. 

But the whole vital process of the earth takes place so gradually
and in periods of time which are so immense compared with the length
of our life, that these changes are not observed, and before their
course can be recorded from beginning to end whole nations perish
and are destroyed. Of such destructions the most utter and sudden
are due to wars; but pestilence or famine cause them too. Famines,
again, are either sudden and severe or else gradual. In the latter
case the disappearance of a nation is not noticed because some leave
the country while others remain; and this goes on until the land is
unable to maintain any inhabitants at all. So a long period of time
is likely to elapse from the first departure to the last, and no one
remembers and the lapse of time destroys all record even before the
last inhabitants have disappeared. In the same way a nation must be
supposed to lose account of the time when it first settled in a land
that was changing from a marshy and watery state and becoming dry.
Here, too, the change is gradual and lasts a long time and men do
not remember who came first, or when, or what the land was like when
they came. This has been the case with Egypt. Here it is obvious that
the land is continually getting drier and that the whole country is
a deposit of the river Nile. But because the neighbouring peoples
settled in the land gradually as the marshes dried, the lapse of time
has hidden the beginning of the process. However, all the mouths of
the Nile, with the single exception of that at Canopus, are obviously
artificial and not natural. And Egypt was nothing more than what is
called Thebes, as Homer, too, shows, modern though he is in relation
to such changes. For Thebes is the place that he mentions; which implies
that Memphis did not yet exist, or at any rate was not as important
as it is now. That this should be so is natural, since the lower land
came to be inhabited later than that which lay higher. For the parts
that lie nearer to the place where the river is depositing the silt
are necessarily marshy for a longer time since the water always lies
most in the newly formed land. But in time this land changes its character,
and in its turn enjoys a period of prosperity. For these places dry
up and come to be in good condition while the places that were formerly
well-tempered some day grow excessively dry and deteriorate. This
happened to the land of Argos and Mycenae in Greece. In the time of
the Trojan wars the Argive land was marshy and could only support
a small population, whereas the land of Mycenae was in good condition
(and for this reason Mycenae was the superior). But now the opposite
is the case, for the reason we have mentioned: the land of Mycenae
has become completely dry and barren, while the Argive land that was
formerly barren owing to the water has now become fruitful. Now the
same process that has taken place in this small district must be supposed
to be going on over whole countries and on a large scale.

Men whose outlook is narrow suppose the cause of such events to be
change in the universe, in the sense of a coming to be of the world
as a whole. Hence they say that the sea being dried up and is growing
less, because this is observed to have happened in more places now
than formerly. But this is only partially true. It is true that many
places are now dry, that formerly were covered with water. But the
opposite is true too: for if they look they will find that there are
many places where the sea has invaded the land. But we must not suppose
that the cause of this is that the world is in process of becoming.
For it is absurd to make the universe to be in process because of
small and trifling changes, when the bulk and size of the earth are
surely as nothing in comparison with the whole world. Rather we must
take the cause of all these changes to be that, just as winter occurs
in the seasons of the year, so in determined periods there comes a
great winter of a great year and with it excess of rain. But this
excess does not always occur in the same place. The deluge in the
time of Deucalion, for instance, took place chiefly in the Greek world
and in it especially about ancient Hellas, the country about Dodona
and the Achelous, a river which has often changed its course. Here
the Selli dwelt and those who were formerly called Graeci and now
Hellenes. When, therefore, such an excess of rain occurs we must suppose
that it suffices for a long time. We have seen that some say that
the size of the subterranean cavities is what makes some rivers perennial
and others not, whereas we maintain that the size of the mountains
is the cause, and their density and coldness; for great, dense, and
cold mountains catch and keep and create most water: whereas if the
mountains that overhang the sources of rivers are small or porous
and stony and clayey, these rivers run dry earlier. We must recognize
the same kind of thing in this case too. Where such abundance of rain
falls in the great winter it tends to make the moisture of those places
almost everlasting. But as time goes on places of the latter type
dry up more, while those of the former, moist type, do so less: until
at last the beginning of the same cycle returns. 

Since there is necessarily some change in the whole world, but not
in the way of coming into existence or perishing (for the universe
is permanent), it must be, as we say, that the same places are not
for ever moist through the presence of sea and rivers, nor for ever
dry. And the facts prove this. The whole land of the Egyptians, whom
we take to be the most ancient of men, has evidently gradually come
into existence and been produced by the river. This is clear from
an observation of the country, and the facts about the Red Sea suffice
to prove it too. One of their kings tried to make a canal to it (for
it would have been of no little advantage to them for the whole region
to have become navigable; Sesostris is said to have been the first
of the ancient kings to try), but he found that the sea was higher
than the land. So he first, and Darius afterwards, stopped making
the canal, lest the sea should mix with the river water and spoil
it. So it is clear that all this part was once unbroken sea. For the
same reason Libya-the country of Ammon-is, strangely enough, lower
and hollower than the land to the seaward of it. For it is clear that
a barrier of silt was formed and after it lakes and dry land, but
in course of time the water that was left behind in the lakes dried
up and is now all gone. Again the silting up of the lake Maeotis by
the rivers has advanced so much that the limit to the size of the
ships which can now sail into it to trade is much lower than it was
sixty years ago. Hence it is easy to infer that it, too, like most
lakes, was originally produced by the rivers and that it must end
by drying up entirely. 

Again, this process of silting up causes a continuous current through
the Bosporus; and in this case we can directly observe the nature
of the process. Whenever the current from the Asiatic shore threw
up a sandbank, there first formed a small lake behind it. Later it
dried up and a second sandbank formed in front of the first and a
second lake. This process went on uniformly and without interruption.
Now when this has been repeated often enough, in the course of time
the strait must become like a river, and in the end the river itself
must dry up. 

So it is clear, since there will be no end to time and the world is
eternal, that neither the Tanais nor the Nile has always been flowing,
but that the region whence they flow was once dry: for their effect
may be fulfilled, but time cannot. And this will be equally true of
all other rivers. But if rivers come into existence and perish and
the same parts of the earth were not always moist, the sea must needs
change correspondingly. And if the sea is always advancing in one
place and receding in another it is clear that the same parts of the
whole earth are not always either sea or land, but that all this changes
in course of time. 

So we have explained that the same parts of the earth are not always
land or sea and why that is so: and also why some rivers are perennial
and others not.
