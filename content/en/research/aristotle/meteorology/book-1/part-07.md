We consider a satisfactory explanation of phenomena inaccessible to
observation to have been given when our account of them is free from
impossibilities. 

The observations before us suggest the following
account of the phenomena we are now considering. We know that the
dry and warm exhalation is the outermost part of the terrestrial world
which falls below the circular motion. It, and a great part of the
air that is continuous with it below, is carried round the earth by
the motion of the circular revolution. 

In the course of this motion
it often ignites wherever it may happen to be of the right consistency,
and this we maintain to be the cause of the 'shooting' of scattered
'stars'. We may say, then, that a comet is formed when the upper motion
introduces into a gathering of this kind a fiery principle not of
such excessive strength as to burn up much of the material quickly,
nor so weak as soon to be extinguished, but stronger and capable of
burning up much material, and when exhalation of the right consistency
rises from below and meets it. 

The kind of comet varies according
to the shape which the exhalation happens to take. If it is diffused
equally on every side the star is said to be fringed, if it stretches
out in one direction it is called bearded. We have seen that when
a fiery principle of this kind moves we seem to have a shooting-star:
similarly when it stands still we seem to have a star standing still.
We may compare these phenomena to a heap or mass of chaff into which
a torch is thrust, or a spark thrown. That is what a shooting-star
is like. The fuel is so inflammable that the fire runs through it
quickly in a line. Now if this fire were to persist instead of running
through the fuel and perishing away, its course through the fuel would
stop at the point where the latter was densest, and then the whole
might begin to move. Such is a comet-like a shooting-star that contains
its beginning and end in itself. 

When the matter begins to gather in the lower region independently
the comet appears by itself. But when the exhalation is constituted
by one of the fixed stars or the planets, owing to their motion, one
of them becomes a comet. The fringe is not close to the stars themselves.
Just as haloes appear to follow the sun and the moon as they move,
and encircle them, when the air is dense enough for them to form along
under the sun's course, so too the fringe. It stands in the relation
of a halo to the stars, except that the colour of the halo is due
to reflection, whereas in the case of comets the colour is something
that appears actually on them. 

Now when this matter gathers in relation to a star the comet necessarily
appears to follow the same course as the star. But when the comet
is formed independently it falls behind the motion of the universe,
like the rest of the terrestrial world. It is this fact, that a comet
often forms independently, indeed oftener than round one of the regular
stars, that makes it impossible to maintain that a comet is a sort
of reflection, not indeed, as Hippocrates and his school say, to the
sun, but to the very star it is alleged to accompany-in fact, a kind
of halo in the pure fuel of fire. 

As for the halo we shall explain its cause later. 
The fact that comets when frequent foreshadow wind and drought must
be taken as an indication of their fiery constitution. For their origin
is plainly due to the plentiful supply of that secretion. Hence the
air is necessarily drier and the moist evaporation is so dissolved
and dissipated by the quantity of the hot exhalation as not readily
to condense into water.-But this phenomenon too shall be explained
more clearly later when the time comes to speak of the winds.-So when
there are many comets and they are dense, it is as we say, and the
years are clearly dry and windy. When they are fewer and fainter this
effect does not appear in the same degree, though as a rule the is
found to be excessive either in duration or strength. For instance
when the stone at Aegospotami fell out of the air-it had been carried
up by a wind and fell down in the daytime-then too a comet happened
to have appeared in the west. And at the time of the great comet the
winter was dry and north winds prevailed, and the wave was due to
an opposition of winds. For in the gulf a north wind blew and outside
it a violent south wind. Again in the archonship of Nicomachus a comet
appeared for a few days about the equinoctial circle (this one had
not risen in the west), and simultaneously with it there happened
the storm at Corinth. 

That there are few comets and that they appear rarely and outside
the tropic circles more than within them is due to the motion of the
sun and the stars. For this motion does not only cause the hot principle
to be secreted but also dissolves it when it is gathering. But the
chief reason is that most of this stuff collects in the region of
the milky way.
