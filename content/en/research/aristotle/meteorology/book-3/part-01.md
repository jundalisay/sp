When exhalation is secreted in small and scattered quantities and frequently, and is transitory,
and its constitution rare, it gives rise to thunder and lightning.

But if it is secreted in a body and is denser, that is, less rare,
we get a hurricane. 

The fact that it issues in body explains its violence:
it is due to the rapidity of the secretion. Now when this secretion
issues in a great and continuous current the result corresponds to
what we get when the opposite development takes place and rain and
a quantity of water are produced. 

As far as the matter from which
they are developed goes both sets of phenomena are the same. As soon
as a stimulus to the development of either potentiality appears, that
of which there is the greater quantity present in the cloud is at
once secreted from it, and there results either rain, or, if the other
exhalation prevails, a hurricane. 

Sometimes the exhalation in the cloud, when it is being secreted,
collides with another under circumstances like those found when a
wind is forced from an open into a narrow space in a gateway or a
road. It often happens in such cases that the first part of the moving
body is deflected because of the resistance due either to the narrowness
or to a contrary current, and so the wind forms a circle and eddy.
It is prevented from advancing in a straight line: at the same time
it is pushed on from behind; so it is compelled to move sideways in
the direction of least resistance. 

The same thing happens to the next
part, and the next, and so on, till the series becomes one, that is,
till a circle is formed: for if a figure is described by a single
motion that figure must itself be one. This is how eddies are generated
on the earth, and the case is the same in the clouds as far as the
beginning of them goes. Only here (as in the case of the hurricane
which shakes off the cloud without cessation and becomes a continuous
wind) the cloud follows the exhalation unbroken, and the exhalation,
failing to break away from the cloud because of its density, first
moves in a circle for the reason given and then descends, because
clouds are always densest on the side where the heat escapes. This
phenomenon is called a whirlwind when it is colourless; and it is
a sort of undigested hurricane. There is never a whirlwind when the
weather is northerly, nor a hurricane when there is snow. The reason
is that all these phenomena are 'wind', and wind is a dry and warm
evaporation. Now frost and cold prevail over this principle and quench
it at its birth: that they do prevail is clear or there could be no
snow or northerly rain, since these occur when the cold does prevail.

So the whirlwind originates in the failure of an incipient hurricane
to escape from its cloud: it is due to the resistance which generates
the eddy, and it consists in the spiral which descends to the earth
and drags with it the cloud which it cannot shake off. It moves things
by its wind in the direction in which it is blowing in a straight
line, and whirls round by its circular motion and forcibly snatches
up whatever it meets. 

When the cloud burns as it is drawn downwards, that is, when the exhalation
becomes rarer, it is called a fire-wind, for its fire colours the
neighbouring air and inflames it. 

When there is a great quantity of exhalation and it is rare and is
squeezed out in the cloud itself we get a thunderbolt. If the exhalation
is exceedingly rare this rareness prevents the thunderbolt from scorching
and the poets call it 'bright': if the rareness is less it does scorch
and they call it 'smoky'. The former moves rapidly because of its
rareness, and because of its rapidity passes through an object before
setting fire to it or dwelling on it so as to blacken it: the slower
one does blacken the object, but passes through it before it can actually
burn it. Further, resisting substances are affected, unresisting ones
are not. For instance, it has happened that the bronze of a shield
has been melted while the woodwork remained intact because its texture
was so loose that the exhalation filtered through without affecting
it. So it has passed through clothes, too, without burning them, and
has merely reduced them to shreds. 

Such evidence is enough by itself to show that the exhalation is at
work in all these cases, but we sometimes get direct evidence as well,
as in the case of the conflagration of the temple at Ephesus which
we lately witnessed. There independent sheets of flame left the main
fire and were carried bodily in many directions. Now that smoke is
exhalation and that smoke burns is certain, and has been stated in
another place before; but when the flame moves bodily, then we have
ocular proof that smoke is exhalation. On this occasion what is seen
in small fires appeared on a much larger scale because of the quantity
of matter that was burning. The beams which were the source of the
exhalation split, and a quantity of it rushed in a body from the place
from which it issued forth and went up in a blaze: so that the flame
was actually seen moving through the air away and falling on the houses.
For we must recognize that exhalation accompanies and precedes thunderbolts
though it is colourless and so invisible. Hence, where the thunderbolt
is going to strike, the object moves before it is struck, showing
that the exhalation leads the way and falls on the object first. Thunder,
too, splits things not by its noise but because the exhalation that
strikes the object and that which makes the noise are ejected simultaneously.
This exhalation splits the thing it strikes but does not scorch it
at all. 

We have now explained thunder and lightning and hurricane, and further
firewinds, whirlwinds, and thunderbolts, and shown that they are all
of them forms of the same thing and wherein they all differ.
