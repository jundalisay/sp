The rainbow can never be a circle nor a segment of a circle greater than a semicircle. The consideration of the diagram will prove this and the other properties of the rainbow. (See diagram.) 

Let A be a hemisphere resting on the circle of the horizon, let its centre be K and let H be another point appearing on the horizon. Then, if the lines that fall in a cone from K have HK as their axis, and,
K and M being joined, the lines KM are reflected from the hemisphere
to H over the greater angle, the lines from K will fall on the circumference
of a circle. If the reflection takes place when the luminous body
is rising or setting the segment of the circle above the earth which
is cut off by the horizon will be a semi-circle; if the luminous body
is above the horizon it will always be less than a semicircle, and
it will be smallest when the luminous body culminates.

First let the
luminous body be appearing on the horizon at the point H, and let
KM be reflected to H, and let the plane in which A is, determined
by the triangle HKM, be produced. Then the section of the sphere will
be a great circle. Let it be A (for it makes no difference which of
the planes passing through the line HK and determined by the triangle
KMH is produced). Now the lines drawn from H and K to a point on the
semicircle A are in a certain ratio to one another, and no lines drawn
from the same points to another point on that semicircle can have
the same ratio. For since both the points H and K and the line KH
are given, the line MH will be given too; consequently the ratio of
the line MH to the line MK will be given too. So M will touch a given
circumference. Let this be NM. Then the intersection of the circumferences
is given, and the same ratio cannot hold between lines in the same
plane drawn from the same points to any other circumference but MN.

Draw a line DB outside of the figure and divide it so that D:B=MH:MK.
But MH is greater than MK since the reflection of the cone is over
the greater angle (for it subtends the greater angle of the triangle
KMH). Therefore D is greater than B. Then add to B a line Z such that
B+Z:D=D:B. Then make another line having the same ratio to B as KH
has to Z, and join MI. 

Then I is the pole of the circle on which the lines from K fall. For
the ratio of D to IM is the same as that of Z to KH and of B to KI.
If not, let D be in the same ratio to a line indifferently lesser
or greater than IM, and let this line be IP. Then HK and KI and IP
will have the same ratios to one another as Z, B, and D. But the ratios
between Z, B, and D were such that Z+B:D=D: B. Therefore Ih:IP=IP:IK.
Now, if the points K, H be joined with the point P by the lines HP,
KP, these lines will be to one another as IH is to IP, for the sides
of the triangles HIP, KPI about the angle I are homologous. Therefore,
HP too will be to KP as HI is to IP. But this is also the ratio of
MH to MK, for the ratio both of HI to IP and of Mh to MK is the same
as that of D to B. Therefore, from the points H, K there will have
been drawn lines with the same ratio to one another, not only to the
circumference MN but to another point as well, which is impossible.
Since then D cannot bear that ratio to any line either lesser or greater
than IM (the proof being in either case the same), it follows that
it must stand in that ratio to MI itself. Therefore as MI is to IK
so IH will be to MI and finally MH to Mk. 

If, then, a circle be described with I as pole at the distance MI
it will touch all the angles which the lines from H and K make by
their reflection. If not, it can be shown, as before, that lines drawn
to different points in the semicircle will have the same ratio to
one another, which was impossible. If, then, the semicircle A be revolved
about the diameter HKI, the lines reflected from the points H, K at
the point M will have the same ratio, and will make the angle KMH
equal, in every plane. Further, the angle which HM and MI make with
HI will always be the same. So there are a number of triangles on
HI and KI equal to the triangles HMI and KMI. Their perpendiculars
will fall on HI at the same point and will be equal. Let O be the
point on which they fall. Then O is the centre of the circle, half
of which, MN, is cut off by the horizon. (See diagram.) 

Next let the horizon be ABG but let H have risen above the horizon.
Let the axis now be HI. The proof will be the same for the rest as
before, but the pole I of the circle will be below the horizon Ag
since the point H has risen above the horizon. But the pole, and the
centre of the circle, and the centre of that circle (namely HI) which
now determines the position of the sun are on the same line. But since
KH lies above the diameter AG, the centre will be at O on the line
KI below the plane of the circle AG determined the position of the
sun before. So the segment YX which is above the horizon will be less
than a semicircle. For YXM was a semicircle and it has now been cut
off by the horizon AG. So part of it, YM, will be invisible when the
sun has risen above the horizon, and the segment visible will be smallest
when the sun is on the meridian; for the higher H is the lower the
pole and the centre of the circle will be. 

In the shorter days after the autumn equinox there may be a rainbow
at any time of the day, but in the longer days from the spring to
the autumn equinox there cannot be a rainbow about midday. The reason
for this is that when the sun is north of the equator the visible
arcs of its course are all greater than a semicircle, and go on increasing,
while the invisible arc is small, but when the sun is south of the
equator the visible arc is small and the invisible arc great, and
the farther the sun moves south of the equator the greater is the
invisible arc. Consequently, in the days near the summer solstice,
the size of the visible arc is such that before the point H reaches
the middle of that arc, that is its point of culmination, the point
is well below the horizon; the reason for this being the great size
of the visible arc, and the consequent distance of the point of culmination
from the earth. But in the days near the winter solstice the visible
arcs are small, and the contrary is necessarily the case: for the
sun is on the meridian before the point H has risen far.
