The nature and cause of halo, rainbow, mock suns, and rods, since the same account applies to them all. 

We must first describe the phenomena and the circumstances in which
each of them occurs. The halo often appears as a complete circle:
it is seen round the sun and the moon and bright stars, by night as
well as by day, and at midday or in the afternoon, more rarely about
sunrise or sunset. 

The rainbow never forms a full circle, nor any segment greater than
a semicircle. At sunset and sunrise the circle is smallest and the
segment largest: as the sun rises higher the circle is larger and
the segment smaller. After the autumn equinox in the shorter days
it is seen at every hour of the day, in the summer not about midday.
There are never more than two rainbows at one time. Each of them is
three-coloured; the colours are the same in both and their number
is the same, but in the outer rainbow they are fainter and their position
is reversed. In the inner rainbow the first and largest band is red;
in the outer rainbow the band that is nearest to this one and smallest
is of the same colour: the other bands correspond on the same principle.
These are almost the only colours which painters cannot manufacture:
for there are colours which they create by mixing, but no mixing will
give red, green, or purple. These are the colours of the rainbow,
though between the red and the green an orange colour is often seen.

Mock suns and rods are always seen by the side of the sun, not above
or below it nor in the opposite quarter of the sky. They are not seen
at night but always in the neighbourhood of the sun, either as it
is rising or setting but more commonly towards sunset. They have scarcely
ever appeared when the sun was on the meridian, though this once happened
in Bosporus where two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it
all through the day till sunset. 

These are the facts about each of these phenomena: the cause of them
all is the same, for they are all reflections. But they are different
varieties, and are distinguished by the surface from which and the
way in which the reflection to the sun or some other bright object
takes place. 

The rainbow is seen by day, and it was formerly thought that it never
appeared by night as a moon rainbow. This opinion was due to the rarity
of the occurrence: it was not observed, for though it does happen
it does so rarely. The reason is that the colours are not so easy
to see in the dark and that many other conditions must coincide, and
all that in a single day in the month. For if there is to be one it
must be at full moon, and then as the moon is either rising or setting.
So we have only met with two instances of a moon rainbow in more than
fifty years. 

We must accept from the theory of optics the fact that sight is reflected
from air and any object with a smooth surface just as it is from water;
also that in some mirrors the forms of things are reflected, in others
only their colours. Of the latter kind are those mirrors which are
so small as to be indivisible for sense. It is impossible that the
figure of a thing should be reflected in them, for if it is the mirror
will be sensibly divisible since divisibility is involved in the notion
of figure. But since something must be reflected in them and figure
cannot be, it remains that colour alone should be reflected. The colour
of a bright object sometimes appears bright in the reflection, but
it sometimes, either owing to the admixture of the colour of the mirror
or to weakness of sight, gives rise to the appearance of another colour.

However, we must accept the account we have given of these things
in the theory of sensation, and take some things for granted while
we explain others.
