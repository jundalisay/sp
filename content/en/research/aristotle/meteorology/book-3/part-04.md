The rainbow is a reflection: we have now to explain what sort of reflection it is, to describe its various
concomitants, and to assign their causes. 

Sight is reflected from all smooth surfaces, such as are air and water
among others. 

Air must be condensed if it is to act as a mirror, though
it often gives a reflection even uncondensed when the sight is weak.


Such was the case of a man whose sight was faint and indistinct. He
always saw an image in front of him and facing him as he walked. This
was because his sight was reflected back to him. 

Its morbid condition
made it so weak and delicate that the air close by acted as a mirror,
just as distant and condensed air normally does, and his sight could
not push it back. So promontories in the sea 'loom' when there is
a south-east wind, and everything seems bigger, and in a mist, too,
things seem bigger: so, too, the sun and the stars seem bigger when
rising and setting than on the meridian. But things are best reflected
from water, and even in process of formation it is a better mirror
than air, for each of the particles, the union of which constitutes
a raindrop, is necessarily a better mirror than mist. Now it is obvious
and has already been stated that a mirror of this kind renders the
colour of an object only, but not its shape. Hence it follows that
when it is on the point of raining and the air in the clouds is in
process of forming into raindrops but the rain is not yet actually
there, if the sun is opposite, or any other object bright enough to
make the cloud a mirror and cause the sight to be reflected to the
object then the reflection must render the colour of the object without
its shape. Since each of the mirrors is so small as to be invisible
and what we see is the continuous magnitude made up of them all, the
reflection necessarily gives us a continuous magnitude made up of
one colour; each of the mirrors contributing the same colour to the
whole. We may deduce that since these conditions are realizable there
will be an appearance due to reflection whenever the sun and the cloud
are related in the way described and we are between them. But these
are just the conditions under which the rainbow appears. So it is
clear that the rainbow is a reflection of sight to the sun.

So the rainbow always appears opposite the sun whereas the halo is
round it. They are both reflections, but the rainbow is distinguished
by the variety of its colours.

The reflection in the one case is from water which is dark and from a distance; in the other from air which
is nearer and lighter in colour. 

White light through a dark medium or on a dark surface (it makes no difference) looks red. 

We know how red the flame of green wood is: this is because so much smoke is mixed with the bright white firelight: so, too, the sun appears red through smoke and mist.

That is why in the rainbow reflection the outer circumference is red (the reflection being from small particles of water), but not
in the case of the halo. The other colours shall be explained later.

Again, a condensation of this kind cannot persist in the neighbourhood
of the sun: it must either turn to rain or be dissolved, but opposite
to the sun there is an interval during which the water is formed.

If there were not this distinction haloes would be coloured like the
rainbow. Actually no complete or circular halo presents this colour,
only small and fragmentary appearances called 'rods'. But if a haze
due to water or any other dark substance formed there we should have
had, as we maintain, a complete rainbow like that which we do find
lamps. 

A rainbow appears round these in winter, generally with southerly winds.

Persons whose eyes are moist see it most clearly because their
sight is weak and easily reflected. It is due to the moistness of
the air and the soot which the flame gives off and which mixes with
the air and makes it a mirror, and to the blackness which that mirror
derives from the smoky nature of the soot. The light of the lamp appears
as a circle which is not white but purple. It shows the colours of
the rainbow; but because the sight that is reflected is too weak and
the mirror too dark, red is absent. The rainbow that is seen when
oars are raised out of the sea involves the same relative positions
as that in the sky, but its colour is more like that round the lamps,
being purple rather than red. The reflection is from very small particles
continuous with one another, and in this case the particles are fully
formed water. We get a rainbow, too, if a man sprinkles fine drops
in a room turned to the sun so that the sun is shining in part of
the room and throwing a shadow in the rest. Then if one man sprinkles
in the room, another, standing outside, sees a rainbow where the sun's
rays cease and make the shadow. Its nature and colour is like that
from the oars and its cause is the same, for the sprinkling hand corresponds
to the oar. 

That the colours of the rainbow are those we described and how the
other colours come to appear in it will be clear from the following
considerations. We must recognize, as we have said, and lay down:
first, that white colour on a black surface or seen through a black
medium gives red; second, that sight when strained to a distance becomes
weaker and less; third, that black is in a sort the negation of sight:
an object is black because sight fails; so everything at a distance
looks blacker, because sight does not reach it. The theory of these
matters belongs to the account of the senses, which are the proper
subjects of such an inquiry; we need only state about them what is
necessary for us. At all events, that is the reason why distant objects
and objects seen in a mirror look darker and smaller and smoother,
why the reflection of clouds in water is darker than the clouds themselves.
This latter is clearly the case: the reflection diminishes the sight
that reaches them. It makes no difference whether the change is in
the object seen or. in the sight, the result being in either case
the same. The following fact further is worth noticing. When there
is a cloud near the sun and we look at it does not look coloured at
all but white, but when we look at the same cloud in water it shows
a trace of rainbow colouring. Clearly, then, when sight is reflected
it is weakened and, as it makes dark look darker, so it makes white
look less white, changing it and bringing it nearer to black. When
the sight is relatively strong the change is to red; the next stage
is green, and a further degree of weakness gives violet. No further
change is visible, but three completes the series of colours (as we
find three does in most other things), and the change into the rest
is imperceptible to sense. Hence also the rainbow appears with three
colours; this is true of each of the two, but in a contrary way. The
outer band of the primary rainbow is red: for the largest band reflects
most sight to the sun, and the outer band is largest. The middle band
and the third go on the same principle. So if the principles we laid
down about the appearance of colours are true the rainbow necessarily
has three colours, and these three and no others. The appearance of
yellow is due to contrast, for the red is whitened by its juxtaposition
with green. We can see this from the fact that the rainbow is purest
when the cloud is blackest; and then the red shows most yellow. (Yellow
in the rainbow comes between red and green.) So the whole of the red
shows white by contrast with the blackness of the cloud around: for
it is white compared to the cloud and the green. Again, when the rainbow
is fading away and the red is dissolving, the white cloud is brought
into contact with the green and becomes yellow. But the moon rainbow
affords the best instance of this colour contrast. It looks quite
white: this is because it appears on the dark cloud and at night.
So, just as fire is intensified by added fire, black beside black
makes that which is in some degree white look quite white. Bright
dyes too show the effect of contrast. In woven and embroidered stuffs
the appearance of colours is profoundly affected by their juxtaposition
with one another (purple, for instance, appears different on white
and on black wool), and also by differences of illumination. Thus
embroiderers say that they often make mistakes in their colours when
they work by lamplight, and use the wrong ones. 

We have now shown why the rainbow has three colours and that these
are its only colours.

The same cause explains the double rainbow and the faintness of the colours in the outer one and their inverted order.
When sight is strained to a great distance the appearance of the distant
object is affected in a certain way: and the same thing holds good
here. So the reflection from the outer rainbow is weaker because it
takes place from a greater distance and less of it reaches the sun,
and so the colours seen are fainter. Their order is reversed because
more reflection reaches the sun from the smaller, inner band. For
that reflection is nearer to our sight which is reflected from the
band which is nearest to the primary rainbow. Now the smallest band
in the outer rainbow is that which is nearest, and so it will be red;
and the second and the third will follow the same principle. Let B
be the outer rainbow, A the inner one; let R stand for the red colour,
G for green, V for violet; yellow appears at the point Y. Three rainbows
or more are not found because even the second is fainter, so that
the third reflection can have no strength whatever and cannot reach
the sun at all. (See diagram.)
