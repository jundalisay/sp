Why is the halo a circle and why it appears round the sun or the moon or one of the other stars:
the explanation being in all these cases the same. 

Sight is reflected in this way when air and vapour are condensed into
a cloud and the condensed matter is uniform and consists of small
parts. Hence in itself it is a sign of rain, but if it fades away,
of fine weather, if it is broken up, of wind. For if it does not fade
away and is not broken up but is allowed to attain its normal state,
it is naturally a sign of rain since it shows that a process of condensation
is proceeding which must, when it is carried to an end, result in
rain. For the same reason these haloes are the darkest. It is a sign
of wind when it is broken up because its breaking up is due to a wind
which exists there but has not reached us. This view finds support
in the fact that the wind blows from the quarter in which the main
division appears in the halo. Its fading away is a sign of fine weather
because if the air is not yet in a state to get the better of the
heat it contains and proceed to condense into water, this shows that
the moist vapour has not yet separated from the dry and firelike exhalation:
and this is the cause of fine weather. 

So much for the atmospheric conditions under which the reflection
takes place. The reflection is from the mist that forms round the
sun or the moon, and that is why the halo is not seen opposite the
sun like the rainbow. 

Since the reflection takes place in the same way from every point
the result is necessarily a circle or a segment of a circle: for if
the lines start from the same point and end at the same point and
are equal, the points where they form an angle will always lie on
a circle. 

Let AGB and AZB and ADB be lines each of which goes from the point
A to the point B and forms an angle. Let the lines AG, AZ, AD be equal
and those at B, GB, ZB, DB equal too. (See diagram.) 

Draw the line AEB. Then the triangles are equal; for their base Aeb
is equal. Draw perpendiculars to AEB from the angles; GE from G, Ze
from Z, DE from D. Then these perpendiculars are equal, being in equal
triangles. And they are all in one plane, being all at right angles
to AEB and meeting at a single point E. So if you draw the line it
will be a circle and E its centre. Now B is the sun, A the eye, and
the circumference passing through the points GZD the cloud from which
the line of sight is reflected to the sun. 

The mirrors must be thought of as contiguous: each of them is too
small to be visible, but their contiguity makes the whole made up
of them all to seem one. The bright band is the sun, which is seen
as a circle, appearing successively in each of the mirrors as a point
indivisible to sense. The band of cloud next to it is black, its colour
being intensified by contrast with the brightness of the halo. The
halo is formed rather near the earth because that is calmer: for where
there is wind it is clear that no halo can maintain its position.

Haloes are commoner round the moon because the greater heat of the
sun dissolves the condensations of the air more rapidly.

Haloes are formed round stars for the same reasons, but they are not
prognostic in the same way because the condensation they imply is
so insignificant as to be barren.
