Wet and dry both cause evaporation. 

Earthquakes are a necessary consequence of this evaporation.

The earth is dry. But rain fills it with moisture. 

Then the sun and its own fire warm it and give rise to a quantity of wind both outside and inside it. 

This wind sometimes flows outwards in a single body, sometimes inwards, and sometimes it is divided. All these are necessary laws.

Next we must find out what body has the greatest motive force. This will certainly be the body that naturally moves farthest and is most violent.

That which has the most rapid motion is necessarily
the most violent; for its swiftness gives its impact the greatest
force. 

Again, the rarest body, that which can most readily pass through
every other body, is that which naturally moves farthest. Wind satisfies
these conditions in the highest degree (fire only becomes flame and
moves rapidly when wind accompanies it): so that not water nor earth
is the cause of earthquakes but wind-that is, the inrush of the external
evaporation into the earth. 

Hence, since the evaporation generally follows in a continuous body
in the direction in which it first started, and either all of it flows
inwards or all outwards, most earthquakes and the greatest are accompanied
by calm. It is true that some take place when a wind is blowing, but
this presents no difficulty. We sometimes find several winds blowing
simultaneously. If one of these enters the earth we get an earthquake
attended by wind. Only these earthquakes are less severe because their
source and cause is divided. 

Again, most earthquakes and the severest occur at night or, if by
day, about noon, that being generally the calmest part of the day.
For when the sun exerts its full power (as it does about noon) it
shuts the evaporation into the earth. Night, too, is calmer than day.
The absence of the sun makes the evaporation return into the earth
like a sort of ebb tide, corresponding to the outward flow; especially
towards dawn, for the winds, as a rule, begin to blow then, and if
their source changes about like the Euripus and flows inwards the
quantity of wind in the earth is greater and a more violent earthquake
results. 

The severest earthquakes take place where the sea is full of currents
or the earth spongy and cavernous: so they occur near the Hellespont
and in Achaea and Sicily, and those parts of Euboea which correspond
to our description-where the sea is supposed to flow in channels below
the earth. The hot springs, too, near Aedepsus are due to a cause
of this kind. It is the confined character of these places that makes
them so liable to earthquakes. A great and therefore violent wind
is developed, which would naturally blow away from the earth: but
the onrush of the sea in a great mass thrusts it back into the earth.
The countries that are spongy below the surface are exposed to earthquakes
because they have room for so much wind. 

For the same reason earthquakes usually take place in spring and autumn
and in times of wet and of drought-because these are the windiest
seasons. Summer with its heat and winter with its frost cause calm:
winter is too cold, summer too dry for winds to form. In time of drought
the air is full of wind; drought is just the predominance of the dry
over the moist evaporation. Again, excessive rain causes more of the
evaporation to form in the earth. Then this secretion is shut up in
a narrow compass and forced into a smaller space by the water that
fills the cavities. Thus a great wind is compressed into a smaller
space and so gets the upper hand, and then breaks out and beats against
the earth and shakes it violently. 

We must suppose the action of the wind in the earth to be analogous
to the tremors and throbbings caused in us by the force of the wind
contained in our bodies. Thus some earthquakes are a sort of tremor,
others a sort of throbbing. Again, we must think of an earthquake
as something like the tremor that often runs through the body after
passing water as the wind returns inwards from without in one volume.

The force wind can have may be gathered not only from what happens
in the air (where one might suppose that it owed its power to produce
such effects to its volume), but also from what is observed in animal
bodies. Tetanus and spasms are motions of wind, and their force is
such that the united efforts of many men do not succeed in overcoming
the movements of the patients. We must suppose, then (to compare great
things with small), that what happens in the earth is just like that.
Our theory has been verified by actual observation in many places.
It has been known to happen that an earthquake has continued until
the wind that caused it burst through the earth into the air and appeared
visibly like a hurricane. This happened lately near Heracleia in Pontus
and some time past at the island Hiera, one of the group called the
Aeolian islands. Here a portion of the earth swelled up and a lump
like a mound rose with a noise: finally it burst, and a great wind
came out of it and threw up live cinders and ashes which buried the
neighbouring town of Lipara and reached some of the towns in Italy.
The spot where this eruption occurred is still to be seen.

Indeed, this must be recognized as the cause of the fire that is generated
in the earth: the air is first broken up in small particles and then
the wind is beaten about and so catches fire. 

A phenomenon in these islands affords further evidence of the fact
that winds move below the surface of the earth. When a south wind
is going to blow there is a premonitory indication: a sound is heard
in the places from which the eruptions issue. This is because the
sea is being pushed on from a distance and its advance thrusts back
into the earth the wind that was issuing from it. The reason why there
is a noise and no earthquake is that the underground spaces are so
extensive in proportion to the quantity of the air that is being driven
on that the wind slips away into the void beyond. 

Again, our theory is supported by the facts that the sun appears hazy
and is darkened in the absence of clouds, and that there is sometimes
calm and sharp frost before earthquakes at sunrise. The sun is necessarily
obscured and darkened when the evaporation which dissolves and rarefies
the air begins to withdraw into the earth. The calm, too, and the
cold towards sunrise and dawn follow from the theory. The calm we
have already explained. There must as a rule be calm because the wind
flows back into the earth: again, it must be most marked before the
more violent earthquakes, for when the wind is not part outside earth,
part inside, but moves in a single body, its strength must be greater.
The cold comes because the evaporation which is naturally and essentially
hot enters the earth. (Wind is not recognized to be hot, because it
sets the air in motion, and that is full of a quantity of cold vapour.
It is the same with the breath we blow from our mouth: close by it
is warm, as it is when we breathe out through the mouth, but there
is so little of it that it is scarcely noticed, whereas at a distance
it is cold for the same reason as wind.) Well, when this evaporation
disappears into the earth the vaporous exhalation concentrates and
causes cold in any place in which this disappearance occurs.

A sign which sometimes precedes earthquakes can be explained in the
same way. Either by day or a little after sunset, in fine weather,
a little, light, long-drawn cloud is seen, like a long very straight
line. This is because the wind is leaving the air and dying down.
Something analogous to this happens on the sea-shore. When the sea
breaks in great waves the marks left on the sand are very thick and
crooked, but when the sea is calm they are slight and straight (because
the secretion is small). As the sea is to the shore so the wind is
to the cloudy air; so, when the wind drops, this very straight and
thin cloud is left, a sort of wave-mark in the air. 

An earthquake sometimes coincides with an eclipse of the moon for
the same reason. When the earth is on the point of being interposed,
but the light and heat of the sun has not quite vanished from the
air but is dying away, the wind which causes the earthquake before
the eclipse, turns off into the earth, and calm ensues. For there
often are winds before eclipses: at nightfall if the eclipse is at
midnight, and at midnight if the eclipse is at dawn. They are caused
by the lessening of the warmth from the moon when its sphere approaches
the point at which the eclipse is going to take place. So the influence
which restrained and quieted the air weakens and the air moves again
and a wind rises, and does so later, the later the eclipse.

A severe earthquake does not stop at once or after a single shock,
but first the shocks go on, often for about forty days; after that,
for one or even two years it gives premonitory indications in the
same place. The severity of the earthquake is determined by the quantity
of wind and the shape of the passages through which it flows. Where
it is beaten back and cannot easily find its way out the shocks are
most violent, and there it must remain in a cramped space like water
that cannot escape. Any throbbing in the body does not cease suddenly
or quickly, but by degrees according as the affection passes off.
So here the agency which created the evaporation and gave it an impulse
to motion clearly does not at once exhaust the whole of the material
from which it forms the wind which we call an earthquake. So until
the rest of this is exhausted the shocks must continue, though more
gently, and they must go on until there is too little of the evaporation
left to have any perceptible effect on the earth at all.

Subterranean noises, too, are due to the wind; sometimes they portend
earthquakes but sometimes they have been heard without any earthquake
following. Just as the air gives off various sounds when it is struck,
so it does when it strikes other things; for striking involves being
struck and so the two cases are the same. The sound precedes the shock
because sound is thinner and passes through things more readily than
wind. But when the wind is too weak by reason of thinness to cause
an earthquake the absence of a shock is due to its filtering through
readily, though by striking hard and hollow masses of different shapes
it makes various noises, so that the earth sometimes seems to 'bellow'
as the portentmongers say. 

Water has been known to burst out during an earthquake. But that does
not make water the cause of the earthquake. The wind is the efficient
cause whether it drives the water along the surface or up from below:
just as winds are the causes of waves and not waves of winds. Else
we might as well say that earth was the cause; for it is upset in
an earthquake, just like water (for effusion is a form of upsetting).
No, earth and water are material causes (being patients, not agents):
the true cause is the wind. 

The combination of a tidal wave with an earthquake is due to the presence
of contrary winds. It occurs when the wind which is shaking the earth
does not entirely succeed in driving off the sea which another wind
is bringing on, but pushes it back and heaps it up in a great mass
in one place. Given this situation it follows that when this wind
gives way the whole body of the sea, driven on by the other wind,
will burst out and overwhelm the land. This is what happened in Achaea.
There a south wind was blowing, but outside a north wind; then there
was a calm and the wind entered the earth, and then the tidal wave
came on and simultaneously there was an earthquake. This was the more
violent as the sea allowed no exit to the wind that had entered the
earth, but shut it in. So in their struggle with one another the wind
caused the earthquake, and the wave by its settling down the inundation.

Earthquakes are local and often affect a small district only. Whereas winds are not local. Such phenomena are local when the evaporations at a given place are joined by those from the next and unite; this,
as we explained, is what happens when there is drought or excessive
rain locally. 

Earthquakes do come about in this way but winds
do not. 

For earthquakes, rains, and droughts have their source and
origin inside the earth, so that the sun is not equally able to direct
all the evaporations in one direction. 

But on the evaporations in
the air the sun has more influence so that, when once they have been
given an impulse by its motion, which is determined by its various
positions, they flow in one direction. 

When the wind is present in sufficient quantity there is an earthquake. 

The shocks are horizontal like a tremor; except occasionally, in a few places, where they act vertically, upwards from below, like a throbbing. It is the vertical direction which makes this kind of earthquake so rare. 

The motive force does not easily accumulate in great quantity in the position required, since the surface of the earth secretes far more of the evaporation than its depths. 

Wherever an earthquake of this kind does occur a quantity of stones comes to the surface of the earth (as when you throw up things in a winnowing fan), as we see from Sipylus and the Phlegraean plain and the district in Liguria, which were devastated by this kind of earthquake.

Islands in the middle of the sea are less exposed to earthquakes than those near land.

First, the volume of the sea cools the evaporations and overpowers them by its weight and so crushes them. Then, currents and not shocks are produced in the sea by the action of the winds.

Again, it is so extensive that evaporations do not collect in it but issue from it, and these draw the evaporations from the earth after them. Islands near the continent really form part of it: the intervening sea is not enough to make any difference; but those in the open sea can only be shaken if the whole of the sea that surrounds them is shaken too.

We have now explained earthquakes, their nature and cause, and the
most important of the circumstances attendant on their appearance.
