What is the origin of the sea, if it has an origin, and the cause of its salt and bitter taste. 

What made earlier writers consider the sea to be the original and
main body of water is this. It seems reasonable to suppose that to
be the case on the analogy of the other elements. Each of them has
a main bulk which by reason of its mass is the origin of that element,
and any parts which change and mix with the other elements come from
it. Thus the main body of fire is in the upper region; that of air
occupies the place next inside the region of fire; while the mass
of the earth is that round which the rest of the elements are seen
to lie. So we must clearly look for something analogous in the case
of water. But here we can find no such single mass, as in the case
of the other elements, except the sea. River water is not a unity,
nor is it stable, but is seen to be in a continuous process of becoming
from day to day. It was this difficulty which made people regard the
sea as the origin and source of moisture and of all water. And so
we find it maintained that rivers not only flow into the sea but originate
from it, the salt water becoming sweet by filtration. 

But this view involves another difficulty. If this body of water is
the origin and source of all water, why is it salt and not sweet?
The reason for this, besides answering this question, will ensure
our having a right first conception of the nature of the sea.

The earth is surrounded by water, just as that is by the sphere of
air, and that again by the sphere called that of fire (which is the
outermost both on the common view and on ours). Now the sun, moving
as it does, sets up processes of change and becoming and decay, and
by its agency the finest and sweetest water is every day carried up
and is dissolved into vapour and rises to the upper region, where
it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth. This,
as we have said before, is the regular course of nature.

Hence all my predecessors who supposed that the sun was nourished
by moisture are absurdly mistaken. Some go on to say that the solstices
are due to this, the reason being that the same places cannot always
supply the sun with nourishment and that without it he must perish.
For the fire we are familiar with lives as long as it is fed, and
the only food for fire is moisture. As if the moisture that is raised
could reach the sun! or this ascent were really like that performed
by flame as it comes into being, and to which they supposed the case
of the sun to be analogous! Really there is no similarity. A flame
is a process of becoming, involving a constant interchange of moist
and dry. It cannot be said to be nourished since it scarcely persists
as one and the same for a moment. This cannot be true of the sun;
for if it were nourished like that, as they say it is, we should obviously
not only have a new sun every day, as Heraclitus says, but a new sun
every moment. Again, when the sun causes the moisture to rise, this
is like fire heating water. So, as the fire is not fed by the water
above it, it is absurd to suppose that the sun feeds on that moisture,
even if its heat made all the water in the world evaporate. Again,
it is absurd, considering the number and size of the stars, that these
thinkers should consider the sun only and overlook the question how
the rest of the heavenly bodies subsist. Again, they are met by the
same difficulty as those who say that at first the earth itself was
moist and the world round the earth was warmed by the sun, and so
air was generated and the whole firmament grew, and the air caused
winds and solstices. The objection is that we always plainly see the
water that has been carried up coming down again. Even if the same
amount does not come back in a year or in a given country, yet in
a certain period all that has been carried up is returned. This implies
that the celestial bodies do not feed on it, and that we cannot distinguish
between some air which preserves its character once it is generated
and some other which is generated but becomes water again and so perishes;
on the contrary, all the moisture alike is dissolved and all of it
condensed back into water. 

The drinkable, sweet water, then, is light and is all of it drawn
up: the salt water is heavy and remains behind, but not in its natural
place. For this is a question which has been sufficiently discussed
(I mean about the natural place that water, like the other elements,
must in reason have), and the answer is this. The place which we see
the sea filling is not its natural place but that of water. It seems
to belong to the sea because the weight of the salt water makes it
remain there, while the sweet, drinkable water which is light is carried
up. The same thing happens in animal bodies. Here, too, the food when
it enters the body is sweet, yet the residuum and dregs of liquid
food are found to be bitter and salt. This is because the sweet and
drinkable part of it has been drawn away by the natural animal heat
and has passed into the flesh and the other parts of the body according
to their several natures. Now just as here it would be wrong for any
one to refuse to call the belly the place of liquid food because that
disappears from it soon, and to call it the place of the residuum
because this is seen to remain, so in the case of our present subject.
This place, we say, is the place of water. Hence all rivers and all
the water that is generated flow into it: for water flows into the
deepest place, and the deepest part of the earth is filled by the
sea. Only all the light and sweet part of it is quickly carried off
by the sun, while herest remains for the reason we have explained.
It is quite natural that some people should have been puzzled by the
old question why such a mass of water leaves no trace anywhere (for
the sea does not increase though innumerable and vast rivers are flowing
into it every day.) But if one considers the matter the solution is
easy. The same amount of water does not take as long to dry up when
it is spread out as when it is gathered in a body, and indeed the
difference is so great that in the one case it might persist the whole
day long while in the other it might all disappear in a moment-as
for instance if one were to spread out a cup of water over a large
table. This is the case with the rivers: all the time they are flowing
their water forms a compact mass, but when it arrives at a vast wide
place it quickly and imperceptibly evaporates. 

But the theory of the Phaedo about rivers and the sea is impossible.
There it is said that the earth is pierced by intercommunicating channels
and that the original head and source of all waters is what is called
Tartarus-a mass of water about the centre, from which all waters,
flowing and standing, are derived. This primary and original water
is always surging to and fro, and so it causes the rivers to flow
on this side of the earth's centre and on that; for it has no fixed
seat but is always oscillating about the centre. Its motion up and
down is what fills rivers. Many of these form lakes in various places
(our sea is an instance of one of these), but all of them come round
again in a circle to the original source of their flow, many at the
same point, but some at a point opposite to that from which they issued;
for instance, if they started from the other side of the earth's centre,
they might return from this side of it. They descend only as far as
the centre, for after that all motion is upwards. Water gets its tastes
and colours from the kind of earth the rivers happened to flow through.

But on this theory rivers do not always flow in the same sense. For
since they flow to the centre from which they issue forth they will
not be flowing down any more than up, but in whatever direction the
surging of Tartarus inclines to. But at this rate we shall get the
proverbial rivers flowing upwards, which is impossible. Again, where
is the water that is generated and what goes up again as vapour to
come from? For this must all of it simply be ignored, since the quantity
of water is always the same and all the water that flows out from
the original source flows back to it again. This itself is not true,
since all rivers are seen to end in the sea except where one flows
into another. Not one of them ends in the earth, but even when one
is swallowed up it comes to the surface again. And those rivers are
large which flow for a long distance through a lowying country, for
by their situation and length they cut off the course of many others
and swallow them up. This is why the Istrus and the Nile are the greatest
of the rivers which flow into our sea. Indeed, so many rivers fall
into them that there is disagreement as to the sources of them both.
All of which is plainly impossible on the theory, and the more so
as it derives the sea from Tartarus. 

Enough has been said to prove that this is the natural place of water
and not of the sea, and to explain why sweet water is only found in
rivers, while salt water is stationary, and to show that the sea is
the end rather than the source of water, analogous to the residual
matter of all food, and especially liquid food, in animal bodies.
