The sun both checks the formation of winds and stimulates it. When the evaporation is small in amount and faint the sun wastes it and
dissipates by its greater heat the lesser heat contained in the evaporation.

It also dries up the earth, the source of the evaporation, before the latter has appeared in bulk: just as, when you throw a little
fuel into a great fire, it is often burnt up before giving off any
smoke. In these ways the sun checks winds and prevents them from rising
at all: it checks them by wasting the evaporation, and prevents their
rising by drying up the earth quickly. Hence calm is very apt to prevail
about the rising of Orion and lasts until the coming of the Etesiae
and their 'forerunners'. 

Calm is due to two causes. Either cold quenches the evaporation, for
instance a sharp frost: or excessive heat wastes it. In the intermediate
periods, too, the causes are generally either that the evaporation
has not had time to develop or that it has passed away and there is
none as yet to replace it. 

Both the setting and the rising of Orion are considered to be treacherous
and stormy, because they place at a change of season (namely of summer
or winter; and because the size of the constellation makes its rise
last over many days) and a state of change is always indefinite and
therefore liable to disturbance. 

The Etesiae blow after the summer solstice and the rising of the dog-star:
not at the time when the sun is closest nor when it is distant; and
they blow by day and cease at night. The reason is that when the sun
is near it dries up the earth before evaporation has taken place,
but when it has receded a little its heat and the evaporation are
present in the right proportion; so the ice melts and the earth, dried
by its own heat and that of the sun, smokes and vapours. They abate
at night because the cold pf the nights checks the melting of the
ice. What is frozen gives off no evaporation, nor does that which
contains no dryness at all: it is only where something dry contains
moisture that it gives off evaporation under the influence of heat.

Why do the north winds which we call the Etesiae blow continuously after the summer solstice, when there are no corresponding south winds after the winter solstice? The facts are reasonable enough: for the so-called 'white south winds' do blow
at the corresponding season, though they are not equally continuous
and so escape observation and give rise to this inquiry. The reason
for this is that the north wind I from the arctic regions which are
full of water and snow. The sun thaws them and so the Etesiae blow:
after rather than at the summer solstice. (For the greatest heat is
developed not when the sun is nearest to the north, but when its heat
has been felt for a considerable period and it has not yet receded
far. The 'bird winds' blow in the same way after the winter solstice.
They, too, are weak Etesiae, but they blow less and later than the
Etesiae. They begin to blow only on the seventieth day because the
sun is distant and therefore weaker. They do not blow so continuously
because only things on the surface of the earth and offering little
resistance evaporate then, the thoroughly frozen parts requiring greater
heat to melt them. So they blow intermittently till the true Etesiae
come on again at the summer solstice: for from that time onwards the
wind tends to blow continuously.) But the south wind blows from the
tropic of Cancer and not from the antarctic region. 

There are two inhabitable sections of the earth: one near our upper,
or nothern pole, the other near the other or southern pole; and their
shape is like that of a tambourine. If you draw lines from the centre
of the earth they cut out a drum-shaped figure. The lines form two
cones; the base of the one is the tropic, of the other the ever visible
circle, their vertex is at the centre of the earth. Two other cones
towards the south pole give corresponding segments of the earth. These
sections alone are habitable. Beyond the tropics no one can live:
for there the shade would not fall to the north, whereas the earth
is known to be uninhabitable before the sun is in the zenith or the
shade is thrown to the south: and the regions below the Bear are uninhabitable
because of the cold. 

(The Crown, too, moves over this region: for it is in the zenith when
it is on our meridian.) 

So we see that the way in which they now describe the geography of
the earth is ridiculous. They depict the inhabited earth as round,
but both ascertained facts and general considerations show this to
be impossible. If we reflect we see that the inhabited region is limited
in breadth, while the climate admits of its extending all round the
earth. For we meet with no excessive heat or cold in the direction
of its length but only in that of its breadth; so that there is nothing
to prevent our travelling round the earth unless the extent of the
sea presents an obstacle anywhere. The records of journeys by sea
and land bear this out. They make the length far greater than the
breadth. If we compute these voyages and journeys the distance from
the Pillars of Heracles to India exceeds that from Aethiopia to Maeotis
and the northernmost Scythians by a ratio of more than 5 to 3, as
far as such matters admit of accurate statement. Yet we know the whole
breadth of the region we dwell in up to the uninhabited parts: in
one direction no one lives because of the cold, in the other because
of the heat. 

But it is the sea which divides as it seems the parts beyond India
from those beyond the Pillars of Heracles and prevents the earth from
being inhabited all round. 

Now since there must be a region bearing the same relation to the
southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole, it will clearly
correspond in the ordering of its winds as well as in other things.
So just as we have a north wind here, they must have a corresponding
wind from the antarctic. This wind cannot reach us since our own north
wind is like a land breeze and does not even reach the limits of the
region we live in. The prevalence of north winds here is due to our
lying near the north. Yet even here they give out and fail to penetrate
far: in the southern sea beyond Libya east and west winds are always
blowing alternately, like north and south winds with us. So it is
clear that the south wind is not the wind that blows from the south
pole. It is neither that nor the wind from the winter tropic. For
symmetry would require another wind blowing from the summer tropic,
which there is not, since we know that only one wind blows from that
quarter. So the south wind clearly blows from the torrid region. Now
the sun is so near to that region that it has no water, or snow which
might melt and cause Etesiae. But because that place is far more extensive
and open the south wind is greater and stronger and warmer than the
north and penetrates farther to the north than the north wind does
to the south. 

The origin of these winds and their relation to one another has now
been explained.
