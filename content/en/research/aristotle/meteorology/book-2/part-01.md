Why is the sea salty?

The old writers who invented theogonies say that the sea has springs, for they want earth and sea to have foundations and roots of their own. 

Presumably they thought that this view was grander and more impressive
as implying that our earth was an important part of the universe.
For they believed that the whole world had been built up round our
earth and for its sake, and that the earth was the most important
and primary part of it. Others, wiser in human knowledge, give an
account of its origin. At first, they say, the earth was surrounded
by moisture. Then the sun began to dry it up, part of it evaporated
and is the cause of winds and the turnings back of the sun and the
moon, while the remainder forms the sea. So the sea is being dried
up and is growing less, and will end by being some day entirely dried
up. Others say that the sea is a kind of sweat exuded by the earth
when the sun heats it, and that this explains its saltness: for all
sweat is salt. Others say that the saltness is due to the earth. Just
as water strained through ashes becomes salt, so the sea owes its
saltness to the admixture of earth with similar properties.

We must now consider the facts which prove that the sea cannot possibly
have springs. The waters we find on the earth either flow or are stationary.
All flowing water has springs. (By a spring, as we have explained
above, we must not understand a source from which waters are ladled
as it were from a vessel, but a first point at which the water which
is continually forming and percolating gathers.) Stationary water
is either that which has collected and has been left standing, marshy
pools, for instance, and lakes, which differ merely in size, or else
it comes from springs. In this case it is always artificial, I mean
as in the case of wells, otherwise the spring would have to be above
the outlet. Hence the water from fountains and rivers flows of itself,
whereas wells need to be worked artificially. All the waters that
exist belong to one or other of these classes. 

On the basis of this division we can sec that the sea cannot have
springs. For it falls under neither of the two classes; it does not
flow and it is not artificial; whereas all water from springs must
belong to one or other of them. Natural standing water from springs
is never found on such a large scale. 

Again, there are several seas that have no communication with one
another at all. The Red Sea, for instance, communicates but slightly
with the ocean outside the straits, and the Hyrcanian and Caspian
seas are distinct from this ocean and people dwell all round them.
Hence, if these seas had had any springs anywhere they must have been
discovered. 

It is true that in straits, where the land on either side contracts
an open sea into a small space, the sea appears to flow. But this
is because it is swinging to and fro. In the open sea this motion
is not observed, but where the land narrows and contracts the sea
the motion that was imperceptible in the open necessarily strikes
the attention. 

The whole of the Mediterranean does actually flow. The direction of
this flow is determined by the depth of the basins and by the number
of rivers. Maeotis flows into Pontus and Pontus into the Aegean. After
that the flow of the remaining seas is not so easy to observe. The
current of Maeotis and Pontus is due to the number of rivers (more
rivers flow into the Euxine and Maeotis than into the whole Mediterranean
with its much larger basin), and to their own shallowness. For we
find the sea getting deeper and deeper. Pontus is deeper than Maeotis,
the Aegean than Pontus, the Sicilian sea than the Aegean; the Sardinian
and Tyrrhenic being the deepest of all. (Outside the pillars of Heracles
the sea is shallow owing to the mud, but calm, for it lies in a hollow.)
We see, then, that just as single rivers flow from mountains, so it
is with the earth as a whole: the greatest volume of water flows from
the higher regions in the north. Their alluvium makes the northern
seas shallow, while the outer seas are deeper. Some further evidence
of the height of the northern regions of the earth is afforded by
the view of many of the ancient meteorologists. They believed that
the sun did not pass below the earth, but round its northern part,
and that it was the height of this which obscured the sun and caused
night. 

So much to prove that there cannot be sources of the sea and to explain
its observed flow.
