What are lightning and thunder, and whirlwind, fire-wind, and thunderbolts?

Their cause is the same.

There are 2 kinds of exhalation, moist and dry. 

The atmosphere contains them both potentially. It condenses into cloud. The density of the clouds is highest at their upper limit. 

For they must be denser and colder on the side where the heat escapes to the upper region and leaves
them. 

This explains why hurricanes and thunderbolts and all analogous phenomena move downwards in spite of the fact that everything hot
has a natural tendency upwards. Just as the pips that we squeeze between our fingers are heavy but often jump upwards: so these things are
necessarily squeezed out away from the densest part of the cloud.

The heat that escapes disperses to the up region. But if any of
the dry exhalation is caught in the process as the air cools, it is
squeezed out as the clouds contract, and collides in its rapid course
with the neighbouring clouds, and the sound of this collision is what
we call thunder.

This collision is analogous, to compare small with
great, to the sound we hear in a flame which men call the laughter
or the threat of Hephaestus or of Hestia. This occurs when the wood
dries and cracks and the exhalation rushes on the flame in a body.

So in the clouds, the exhalation is projected and its impact on dense
clouds causes thunder: the variety of the sound is due to the irregularity
of the clouds and the hollows that intervene where their density is
interrupted. This then, is thunder, and this its cause. 

It usually happens that the exhalation that is ejected is inflamed
and burns with a thin and faint fire: this is what we call lightning,
where we see as it were the exhalation coloured in the act of its
ejection. It comes into existence after the collision and the thunder,
though we see it earlier because sight is quicker than hearing. The
rowing of triremes illustrates this: the oars are going back again
before the sound of their striking the water reaches us.

However, there are some who maintain that there is actually fire in
the clouds. Empedocles says that it consists of some of the sun's
rays which are intercepted: Anaxagoras that it is part of the upper
ether (which he calls fire) which has descended from above. Lightning,
then, is the gleam of this fire, and thunder the hissing noise of
its extinction in the cloud. 

But this involves the view that lightning actually is prior to thunder
and does not merely appear to be so. Again, this intercepting of the
fire is impossible on either theory, but especially it is said to
be drawn down from the upper ether. Some reason ought to be given
why that which naturally ascends should descend, and why it should
not always do so, but only when it is cloudy. When the sky is clear
there is no lightning: to say that there is, is altogether wanton.

The view that the heat of the sun's rays intercepted in the clouds
is the cause of these phenomena is equally unattractive: this, too,
is a most careless explanation. Thunder, lightning, and the rest must
have a separate and determinate cause assigned to them on which they
ensue. But this theory does nothing of the sort. It is like supposing
that water, snow, and hail existed all along and were produced when
the time came and not generated at all, as if the atmosphere brought
each to hand out of its stock from time to time. They are concretions
in the same way as thunder and lightning are discretions, so that
if it is true of either that they are not generated but pre-exist,
the same must be true of the other. Again, how can any distinction
be made about the intercepting between this case and that of interception
in denser substances such as water? Water, too, is heated by the sun
and by fire: yet when it contracts again and grows cold and freezes
no such ejection as they describe occurs, though it ought on their
the. to take place on a proportionate scale. Boiling is due to the
exhalation generated by fire: but it is impossible for it to exist
in the water beforehand; and besides they call the noise 'hissing',
not 'boiling'. But hissing is really boiling on a small scale: for
when that which is brought into contact with moisture and is in process
of being extinguished gets the better of it, then it boils and makes
the noise in question. Some-Cleidemus is one of them-say that lightning
is nothing objective but merely an appearance. They compare it to
what happens when you strike the sea with a rod by night and the water
is seen to shine. They say that the moisture in the cloud is beaten
about in the same way, and that lightning is the appearance of brightness
that ensues. 

This theory is due to ignorance of the theory of reflection, which
is the real cause of that phenomenon. The water appears to shine when
struck because our sight is reflected from it to some bright object:
hence the phenomenon occurs mainly by night: the appearance is not
seen by day because the daylight is too in, tense and obscures it.

These are the theories of others about thunder and lightning: some
maintaining that lightning is a reflection, the others that lightning
is fire shining through the cloud and thunder its extinction, the
fire not being generated in each case but existing beforehand. We
say that the same stuff is wind on the earth, and earthquake under
it, and in the clouds thunder. The essential constituent of all these
phenomena is the same: namely, the dry exhalation. If it flows in
one direction it is wind, in another it causes earthquakes; in the
clouds, when they are in a process of change and contract and condense
into water, it is ejected and causes thunder and lightning and the
other phenomena of the same nature.
