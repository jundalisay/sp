Some philosophers assert that it is possible for the same thing to exist and not to exist. 

Writers on nature use this language.

But it is impossible for anything to exist and not to exist at the same time. 

<!-- , and by this means have shown that this is the most indisputable of all principles. --> 

The uneducated even demand that this be demonstrated. 

This is because the uneducated do not to know which things one should seek proof and which things one should not
- It would be impossible for everything to be proven.

But it is possible to prove by refutation that it is impossible to prove everything, as long as the disputer says something. 
- But if he says nothing, then it is ridiculous discuss with someone who says nothing just like talking to a plant.

Proving by refutation is different from proving by demonstration.

This is because one who demonstrates something inexplicable is like begging the initial principle.

But proving by refutation refutes the inexplicable cause.

The starting point for all such discussions is not the demand to say that something exists or does not exist, since this wuld be begging the initial principle.

Instead, we demand that the word must signify something understandable to both himself and the disputer.

If there is such a word then there can be a demonstration since something will be defined.

Assume that "man" means one thing, as "two-footed animal".

One thing means that "man" in our discussion will refer only to a 2-footed animal even if "man" can mean other things. 
- Here, the disputer submits to my definition. 


It is possible to assign a separate proper name to each definition.

For example:
- "man" is "two-footed animal"
[- "man-essence" is "humanity"]
[- "civlized-man" is "the most advanced thinking animal"]


But if names were not assigned, and "man" could mean many things then there would be no discussion.

Assume that in a discussion, one word means one thing.

Therefore, it is surely not possible for a physical man to mean the same as an abstact man. 

Physical man means the same as abstact man only if man were a **homonymy**.

But if "physical man" and "abstract man" are the same, then to be a physical man is also the same as to be an abstract man, since "man" is one.

This is what **to be one** *philosophically* signifies, just as cloak and garment are the same *philosophically*.

But "physical man" and "abstract man" were demonstrated to signify something different.

I defined man as a physical man, a **two-footed animal**.

And so man cannot be an abstract man.

In this case, we cannot say that:
- physical man is abstract man 
- abstract man is physical man

A name has one meaning. 

Therefore, 'physical man' cannot mean 'abstract man' if 'man' means two-footed animal.

It is not possible to be physical and abstract, except in virtue of an ambiguity. 


<!-- Can the same thing can at the same time be and not be a man in name, but whether it can be in fact?

If 'man' and 'not-man' mean the same thing, then 'not being a man' will mean nothing different from 'being a man'.

So 'being a man' will be 'not being a man' -- they will mean the same thing.

For being one means this-being related as 'raiment' and 'dress' are, if their definition is one. 

If 'being a man' and 'being a not-man' are to be one, they must mean one thing.

But since 'man' means different things then if something is a man then t must be a two-footed animal. 

If this is necessary, it is impossible that the same thing should not at that time be a two-footed animal.

'Being necessary' means that it is impossible for the thing not to be. 

It is, then, impossible that it should be at the same time true to say the same thing is a man and is not a man.

This also applies to 'not being a man'. -->

Physical man and abstract man mean something different just as to be physically white is different from to be a physical man. 

Physical man is more different from abstract man than physical white is different from physical man.

<!-- But if they say that [5] **to be white** signifies the same thing, the same and one, we will again say the same thing that was said before, that **all things will be one** and not only opposites. If this is not possible, the conclusion follows, provided one answers the question simply.

But if, when simply asked, he also adds [10] the **negations**, he is not answering the question asked. For nothing prevents the same thing from being a **man and white** and countless other things in number. But nevertheless, when asked whether it is true to say that this is a man or not, one must answer with what **signifies one thing** and must not add that it is also white and large. For it is impossible to go through [15] the **accidents** (which are infinite in number). Therefore, let him go through all of them, or none. -->

Assume that physical man and abstract man are the same in 10,000 ways. If the disputer asks if both definitions are the same, then you can agree as long as he adds all the other 10,000 attributes that are accidental to both defintions.

<!-- , those that it is or is not. [20] But if he does this, **he is not engaged in discussion** (or dialectic). -->

Some say that this would destroy the substance or essence of the defintion because this makes the definition accept accidental nuances. 

<!-- ** and the **'what-it-was-to-be'** (essence).  -->

<!-- For they must affirm that **everything is accidental** to everything else, and that to be precisely a man or to be precisely an animal is not its being.  -->

My definition of physical man is precise. It cannot be abstract man, which negates it since the substance was its physicality.

 <!-- **to be not-a-man** or **to be not-man** [25] (and yet these are the negations of it). For that term signifies **one thing**, and this was the **substance** of something. -->

Substance means that it is existence that is true only for itself and not other things.

But if physical man is precisely abstract man or non-physical man, then its existence will be something else.

Consequently, they would say that:
- no such definition exists for anything
- everything is predicated accidentally

It would mean that physical whiteness is accidental to physical man because he is white, but white is not his essence.

If every attribute is accidental, then every definition is an attribute. 

 <!-- will be no **primary subject** of predication, since the accident always signifies a category predicated of some **underlying subject**. -->

This means that attributes are attributes of attributes. This goes to infinity which is impossible.

This is because not more than two are usually combined as attributes to subjects.

The accident is not an accident of an accident, unless it is because both are accidental to the same thing. 

For example, the white is musical and this is white because both are accidental to the man. 

But Socrates is not musical in this way, because both are accidental to something else.

This means that the connection of white to Socrates cannot be infinite moving upward (in the series of predication).

For example, something else accidental to the white Socrates: [10] for no **one thing** is generated from all of them. 

Nor, indeed, will something else be accidental to the white, such as the musical: for neither is this accidental to that any more than that to this, and at the same time it is distinguished that some are accidental in this way, and others as the musical is to Socrates: 

But those that are in the former way, an accident is **not accidental to an accident**, but only those that are in the latter way, so that not everything will be said to be accidental.


There will be, therefore, something that signifies **substance** even in this way. If this is the case, it has been demonstrated that it is impossible for contradictions to be predicated simultaneously.

Furthermore, if all contradictions are true at the same time concerning the same subject, it is clear that [20] **all things will be one**. For the same thing will be both a **trireme** and a **wall** and a **man**, if it is possible to affirm or deny anything of everything, as is necessary for those who assert the argument of Protagoras. For if someone thinks that the man is not a trireme, it is clear that he is not a trireme: so that he is also a trireme, [25] if the contradiction is true.

And so, the result is that of Anaxagoras: **all things are together (commingled)**; so that nothing truly belongs to anything. They seem, therefore, to be speaking of the **indefinite** (or indeterminate), and while thinking they speak of being, they speak about **non-being**: for the indefinite is the thing that is potentially but not in actuality.

But they must assert [30] the affirmation or the denial of every attribute about every subject: for it is absurd if the negation of an attribute itself belongs to each subject, but the negation of another attribute that does not belong to it does not belong: I mean, for example, if it is true to say that the man is not a man, it is clear that he is also either a trireme or not a trireme. If, then, the affirmation belongs, [35] the negation must also belong: but if the affirmation does not belong, the negation will belong even more than the attribute itself.










The predication, then, must go on ad infinitum. But this is impossible; for not even more than two terms can be combined in accidental predication. 

1. An accident is not an accident of an accident, unless it be because both are accidents of the same subject. 

For instance, that the white is musical and the latter is white, only because both are accidental to man. 

2. Socrates is musical, not in this sense, that both terms are accidental to something else. 

Since then some predicates are accidental in this and some in that sense, 

(a) those which are accidental in the latter sense, in which white is accidental to Socrates, cannot form an infinite series in the upward direction; e.g. Socrates the white has not yet another accident; for no unity can be got out of such a sum.

(b) Nor will 'white' have another term accidental to it, e.g. 'musical'. 

For this is no more accidental to that than that is to this.

At the same time we have drawn the distinction, that while some predicates are accidental in this sense, others are so in the sense in which 'musical' is accidental to Socrates; and the accident is an accident of an accident not in cases of the latter kind, but only in cases of the other kind, so that not all terms will be accidental. 

There must, then, even so be something which denotes substance. 

And if this is so, it has been shown that contradictories cannot be predicated at the same time.

If all contradictory statements are true of the same subject at the same time, evidently all things will be one. 

For the same thing will be a trireme, a wall, and a man, if of everything it is possible either to affirm or to deny anything (and this premiss must be accepted by those who share the views of Protagoras). For if any one thinks that the man is not a trireme, evidently he is not a trireme; so that he also is a trireme, if, as they say, contradictory statements are both true.

We thus get the doctrine of Anaxagoras, that all things are mixed together; so that nothing really exists. They seem, then, to be speaking of the indeterminate, and, while fancying themselves to be speaking of being, they are speaking about non-being; for it is that which exists potentially and not in complete reality that is indeterminate. 

But they must predicate of every subject the affirmation or the negation of every attribute. For it is absurd if of each subject its own negation is to be predicable, while the negation of something else which cannot be predicated of it is not to be predicable of it; for instance, if it is true to say of a man that he is not a man, evidently it is also true to say that he is either a trireme or not a trireme.

If, then, the affirmative can be predicated, the negative must be predicable too; and if the affirmative is not predicable, the negative, at least, will be more predicable than the negative of the subject itself. If, then, even the latter negative is predicable, the negative of 'trireme' will be also predicable; and, if this is predicable, the affirmative will be so too.

"Those, then, who maintain this view are driven to this conclusion, and to the further conclusion that it is not necessary either to assert or to deny. For if it is true that a thing is a man and a not-man, evidently also it will be neither a man nor a not-man. For to the two assertions there answer two negations, and if the former is treated as a single proposition compounded out of two, the latter also is a single proposition opposite to the former.

"Again, either the theory is true in all cases, and a thing is both white and not-white, and existent and non-existent, and all other assertions and negations are similarly compatible or the theory is true of some statements and not of others. And if not of all, the exceptions will be contradictories of which admittedly only one is true; but if of all, again either the negation will be true wherever the assertion is, and the assertion true wherever the negation is, or the negation will be true where the assertion is, but the assertion not always true where the negation is. And (a) in the latter case there will be something which fixedly is not, and this will be an indisputable belief; and if non-being is something indisputable and knowable, the opposite assertion will be more knowable. 

But (b) if it is equally possible also to assert all that it is possible to deny, one must either be saying what is true when one separates the predicates (and says, for instance, that a thing is white, and again that it is not-white), or not. And if (i) it is not true to apply the predicates separately, our opponent is not saying what he professes to say, and also nothing at all exists; but how could non-existent things speak or walk, as he does? 

Also all things would on this view be one, as has been already said, and man and God and trireme and their contradictories will be the same. For if contradictories can be predicated alike of each subject, one thing will in no wise differ from another; for if it differ, this difference will be something true and peculiar to it. And (ii) if one may with truth apply the predicates separately, the above-mentioned result follows none the less, and, further, it follows that all would then be right and all would be in error, and our opponent himself confesses himself to be in error.-And at the same time our discussion with him is evidently about nothing at all; for he says nothing. For he says neither 'yes' nor 'no', but 'yes and no'; and again he denies both of these and says 'neither yes nor no'; for otherwise there would already be something definite.

"Again if when the assertion is true, the negation is false, and when this is true, the affirmation is false, it will not be possible to assert and deny the same thing truly at the same time. But perhaps they might say this was the very question at issue.

"Again, is he in error who judges either that the thing is so or that it is not so, and is he right who judges both? If he is right, what can they mean by saying that the nature of existing things is of this kind? 

If he is not right, but more right than he who judges in the other way, being will already be of a definite nature, and this will be true, and not at the same time also not true. But if all are alike both wrong and right, one who is in this condition will not be able either to speak or to say anything intelligible; for he says at the same time both 'yes' and 'no.' 

If he makes no judgement but 'thinks' and 'does not think', indifferently, what difference will there be between him and a vegetable?

Thus, then, it is in the highest degree evident that neither any one of those who maintain this view nor any one else is really in this position. 

For why does a man walk to Megara and not stay at home, when he thinks he ought to be walking there? Why does he not walk early some morning into a well or over a precipice, if one happens to be in his way? Why do we observe him guarding against this, evidently because he does not think that falling in is alike good and not good? Evidently, then, he judges one thing to be better and another worse. 

If this is so, he must also judge one thing to be a man and another to be not-a-man, one thing to be sweet and another to be not-sweet. For he does not aim at and judge all things alike, when, thinking it desirable to drink water or to see a man, he proceeds to aim at these things; yet he ought, if the same thing were alike a man and not-a-man. But, as was said, there is no one who does not obviously avoid some things and not others. 

Therefore, as it seems, all men make unqualified judgements, if not about all things, still about what is better and worse. And if this is not knowledge but opinion, they should be all the more anxious about the truth, as a sick man should be more anxious about his health than one who is healthy; for he who has opinions is, in comparison with the man who knows, not in a healthy state as far as the truth is concerned.

Again, however much all things may be 'so and not so', still there is a more and a less in the nature of things; for we should not say that two and three are equally even, nor is he who thinks four things are five equally wrong with him who thinks they are a thousand.

If then they are not equally wrong, obviously one is less wrong and therefore more right. If then that which has more of any quality is nearer the norm, there must be some truth to which the more true is nearer. And even if there is not, still there is already something better founded and liker the truth, and we shall have got rid of the unqualified doctrine which would prevent us from determining anything in our thought.
