Some philosophers assert that it is possible for the same thing to exist and not to exist. 

Writers on physical nature [physicists] use this language.

But it is impossible for anything to exist physically and not to exist [i.e. exist abstractly] at the same time. 

<!-- , and by this means have shown that this is the most indisputable of all principles. --> 

The uneducated even demand that this be demonstrated.*

{{< n n="The non-physicists know that a physical thing also has an abstract version. But Aristotle only allows the physical" >}}

This is because the uneducated do not to know which things one should seek proof and which things one should not
- It would be impossible for everything to be proven.

But it is possible to prove by refutation that it is impossible to prove everything, as long as the disputer says something. 
- But if he says nothing, then it is ridiculous discuss with someone who says nothing just like talking to a plant.

Proving by refutation is different from proving by demonstration.

This is because one who demonstrates something inexplicable is like begging the initial principle.*

{{< n n="The intial principle is abstract. Yet Aristotle refuses to accept the abstract version" >}}

But proving by refutation refutes the inexplicable cause.


## Aristotle's System: Definitions

The starting point for all such discussions is not the demand to say that something exists or does not exist, since this wuld be begging the initial principle.

Instead, we demand that the word must signify something understandable to both himself and the disputer.

If there is such a word then there can be a demonstration since something will be defined.

Assume that "man" means one thing, as "two-footed animal".

One thing means that "man" in our discussion will refer only to a 2-footed animal even if "man" can mean other things. 
- Here, the disputer submits to my definition. 


It is possible to assign a separate proper name to each definition.

For example:
- "man" is "two-footed animal"
- ["man-essence" is "humanity"]
- ["civlized-man" is "the most advanced thinking animal"]


But if names were not assigned, and "man" could mean many things then there would be no discussion.

Assume that in a discussion, one word means one thing.

Therefore, it is surely not possible for a physical man to mean the same as an abstact man. 

Physical man means the same as abstact man only if man were a **homonymy**.

But if "physical man" and "abstract man" are the same, then to be a physical man is also the same as to be an abstract man, since "man" is one.

This is what **to be one** *philosophically* signifies, just as cloak and garment are the same *philosophically*.

But "physical man" and "abstract man" were demonstrated to signify something different.

I defined man as a physical man, a **two-footed animal**.

And so man cannot be an abstract man.

In this case, we cannot say that:
- physical man is abstract man 
- abstract man is physical man

A name has one meaning. 

Therefore, 'physical man' cannot mean 'abstract man' if 'man' means two-footed animal.

It is not possible to be physical and abstract, except in virtue of an ambiguity. 


<!-- Can the same thing can at the same time be and not be a man in name, but whether it can be in fact?

If 'man' and 'not-man' mean the same thing, then 'not being a man' will mean nothing different from 'being a man'.

So 'being a man' will be 'not being a man' -- they will mean the same thing.

For being one means this-being related as 'raiment' and 'dress' are, if their definition is one. 

If 'being a man' and 'being a not-man' are to be one, they must mean one thing.

But since 'man' means different things then if something is a man then t must be a two-footed animal. 

If this is necessary, it is impossible that the same thing should not at that time be a two-footed animal.

'Being necessary' means that it is impossible for the thing not to be. 

It is, then, impossible that it should be at the same time true to say the same thing is a man and is not a man.

This also applies to 'not being a man'. -->

Physical man and abstract man mean something different just as to be physically white is different from to be a physical man. 

Physical man is more different from abstract man than physical white is different from physical man.

<!-- But if they say that [5] **to be white** signifies the same thing, the same and one, we will again say the same thing that was said before, that **all things will be one** and not only opposites. If this is not possible, the conclusion follows, provided one answers the question simply.

But if, when simply asked, he also adds [10] the **negations**, he is not answering the question asked. For nothing prevents the same thing from being a **man and white** and countless other things in number. But nevertheless, when asked whether it is true to say that this is a man or not, one must answer with what **signifies one thing** and must not add that it is also white and large. For it is impossible to go through [15] the **accidents** (which are infinite in number). Therefore, let him go through all of them, or none. -->


Assume that physical man and abstract man are the same in 10,000 ways. If the disputer asks if both definitions are the same, then you can agree as long as he adds all the other 10,000 attributes that are accidental to both definitions.

<!-- , those that it is or is not. [20] But if he does this, **he is not engaged in discussion** (or dialectic). -->

Some say that this would destroy the substance or essence of the definition because this makes the definition accept accidental nuances. 

<!-- ** and the **'what-it-was-to-be'** (essence).  -->

<!-- For they must affirm that **everything is accidental** to everything else, and that to be precisely a man or to be precisely an animal is not its being.  -->

My definition of physical man is precise. It cannot be abstract man, which negates it since the substance was its physicality.

 <!-- **to be not-a-man** or **to be not-man** [25] (and yet these are the negations of it). For that term signifies **one thing**, and this was the **substance** of something. -->



## Anaxagoras' System: Substance 

Substance means that it is existence that is true only for itself and not other things.

But if physical man is precisely abstract man or non-physical man, then its existence will be something else.

Consequently, they would say that:
- no such definition exists for anything
- everything is predicated accidentally

It would mean that physical whiteness is accidental to physical man because he is white, but white is not his essence.

If every attribute is accidental, then every definition is an attribute. 

 <!-- will be no **primary subject** of predication, since the accident always signifies a category predicated of some **underlying subject**. -->

This means that attributes are attributes of attributes. This goes to infinity which is impossible.

This is because not more than two are usually combined as attributes to subjects.

The accident is not an accident of an accident, unless it is because both are accidental to the same thing. 

For example, this music is audibly white, but that thing is also visually white.

Both whites are accidental to the man. 

But visually-white Socrates is not audibly-white. And so such whitness is an accidental attribute of something else, not of Socrates.

This means that the connection of white to Socrates cannot be infinite moving upward (in the series of predication).

For example, there is something else remotely connected and accidental to the white Socrates [to make him audibly-white too] for no **one thing** is generated from all of them.*

{{< n n="Aristotle is allergic to a fixed abstract substance and so he tries to connect abstractions by relations or 'accidents'. So Aristotle is effect-based, while Anaxagoras is cause-based" >}}

Music is not an accident of white, nor of Socrates.

<!-- Nor, indeed, will something else be accidental to the white, such as the musical: for neither is this accidental to that any more than that to this, and at the same time it is distinguished that some are accidental in this way, and others as the musical is to Socrates:  -->

The refuters of this doctrine of substance say that:
- an accident is not accidental to an accident
- not everything is accidental

<!-- **, but only those that are in the latter way, so that . -->

This still allows **substance**.

But still I have shown that it is impossible for contradictions [of physicality and abstraction] to be predicated simultaneously [instead they should be defined and separated].


## Protagoras' System: Physicality

If all contradictions are true for the same subject, then **all things will be one**. 
- A **trireme**, **wall**, and **man** are all one as physicality. [i.e. they are all connected by the one idea of physicality]

In this case, it would be possible to affirm or deny anything of everything.
- This is the argument of Protagoras. 
- It means that a physical man is not a physical trireme, yet is the same as the trireme in physicality. 

<!-- it is clear that he is not a trireme: so that he is also a trireme, [25] if the contradiction is true. -->

And so, the result is that of Anaxagoras: **all things are together (commingled)**
- Nothing truly belongs to anything.

Therefore, they are speaking of the indeterminate. So while speaking of physicality, they speak about abstraction.

 <!-- **non-being**. -->

- The indefinite abstract is the thing that is physically potential but not physically actual.

But they must assert the affirmation or the denial of every attribute about every subject.

<!-- for it is absurd if the negation of an attribute itself belongs to each subject, but the negation of another attribute that does not belong to it does not belong: I mean,  -->

For example, if the physical man is not an abstract man, then he is also physical like the trireme or not physical.

  <!-- it is clear that he is also either a trireme or not a trireme.  -->

If the physical man is affirmed to be not abstact man then the negation must also be allowed.

But if physical man is abstract man then the abstraction will be the attribute itself [of the physical man].

Thus, the followers of Protogoras believes that it is not necessary to affirm or to deny.

If physical man and abstract man are the same, then non-physical man and physicalized abstract man are the same. 
- These are 2 denials of the 2 propositions.

<!-- , and if that [dual assertion] is one compound from both, then this [dual negation] would be a single opposite. -->

If this does not hold for all, then they would be one would be true and the other would be false.


## Anaxagoras vs Protogoras

But if this holds for all things, then everything is both:
- physically white and abstractly white
- physical and abstract

<!-- either  those [propositions] would be generally accepted [as true or false]: but if it holds for all, again, either it holds for all things where affirmation and denial [is possible] and where denial and affirmation [is possible], or affirmation and denial holds for some, but denial for all does not mean affirmation for all. And if it is in this way, -->

This means that there is something fixedly abstact. 

This is a firm opinion [of the supporters of Anaxagoras] that the abstract is something firm and knowable.

It means that the opposite affirmation of physicality would be more knowable.


But if we allow denials then we should speak by distinguishing [to clear things up].

<!-- it is similarly true to affirm all those things for which denial is possible, it is necessary either to speak truly by  -->

For example, that a thing is physically white and abstractly white or not abstractly white. 

Without this clarification [of physical or abstract], then nothing exists physically and all things would be one abstraction.

<!-- And if it is not true to speak by distinguishing, he does not say these things and nothing exists (and how could he utter or walk if things do not exist?), and   -->
- The same abstract thing will be a man and a god and a trireme and their contradictions 

<!-- (for if [the contradiction] holds similarly for each thing, nothing will differ from another: for if they did differ, this would be true and peculiar to it): and similarly,  -->

<!-- If it is possible to speak truly by distinguishing, then everyone would be speaking truly and everyone would be speaking falsely, and he himself admits that he is lying.

At the same time, the inquiry is about nothing with respect to this person. For he says nothing. 

For he neither says so nor not so, but so and not so: and again he denies both of these, that it is neither so nor not so: for if not, already something would be determinate.

If, when the affirmation is true, the denial is false, and when the denial is true, the affirmation is false, then the same thing cannot be truly affirmed and denied at the same time." -->

The supporters of Anaxagoras say that this is their point from the start.

They say that:
- a person who supposes that a thing is either only physical or abstract is mistaken
- a person who supposes that a thing is both physical and abstrct is speaking truly

They say that **such is the nature of existing things**.

I ask what do they mean?*
