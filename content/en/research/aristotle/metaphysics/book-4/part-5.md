But if [the materialist] Protogoras were correct, then physically existing things would have a fixed nature.
- Only the physicality would be true, not the abstraction.

 <!-- and this would be true, and **not both true and not-true at the same time.**  -->

But if so, then we would be talking about physical and abstract versions at the same time.

<!-- If, however, all men equally both speak falsely and speak truly, **it will not be possible for such a man to utter or speak**: for he says both these things and not-these things at the same time. -->

If he is like Protogoras who equally believes and does not believe, **how would he differ from the plants?** 

<!-- This is why it is especially clear that **no one is so disposed,** neither among others nor among those who state this argument.  -->

Why would he walk to Megara and not stay still if he believes in walking and not walking?

 <!-- supposing that he ought to walk?  -->

Why does he take care not to fall into a ravine when he supposes equally that falling in is both good and not good?

**It is because he supposes one thing to be better than the other.**

So it means not all to him is equal. 

<!-- If so, he must also suppose one thing to be **man** and the other **not-man**, and one thing **sweet** and the other **not-sweet**.  -->

<!-- For he does not seek and suppose all things equally when, having believed it is better to drink water and see a man, he then seeks them: and yet he ought to, if **man and not-man were the same thing equally.** But, as was said, **no one is observed who does not guard against some things and not others**: so, it seems, all men simply suppose that [things] have a fixed nature, if not regarding all things, at least regarding the better and the worse. -->

The followers of Protogoras do this by opinion, not by knowledge.

I think they should use knowledge than opinion. 

Furthermore, the system of Protogoras becomes inaccurate. 

We do not say that:
- 2 is as equal to 3
- a man who allows a range of 4 to be 5 to be equal to a man who supposes 4 to be 1,000

In the system of Protogoras, both men are not mistaken, but one is less mistaken than the other.


There could indeed be some truth of which the more true is nearer.

Even if an absolute truth does not exist, a relative truth is better than the unmixed argument that prevents the intellect from determining anything.

The doctrine of **Protagoras** is derived from the same opinion.

<!--  and it is necessary that both [arguments, Protagoras' and the one denying non-contradiction] either stand or fall together: 

for if all things that seem to be are true and all things that appear are true, **it is necessary that all things are both true and false at the same time**  -->


Many people:
- suppose contrary things to one another.
- consider those who have different opinions from them to be wrong

And so the same thing is physical and abstract. 

If so, then everything is true.

The difference is in the way of meeting all disputers. 

- Some need **persuasion**
- Others need **force [or constraint]**

The ignorance of others is easily treated by focusing on their thought, not at the argument.

But for those who speak for the sake of argument, their cure is a **refutation** of the words they use.

This is because some are perplexed by **sensible things** when they see simultaneous contradictions from the same thing.

This makes it impossible for the abstract to become physical [reality], since the thing that pre-existed is contrary to the physical thing. 


## Anaxagoras' System

But Anaxagoras says that everything is **mixed in everything**.

Democritus says the same: the empty and the full exist equally in any given part, although:
- the empty is abstract
- the full is physical

Likewise, some suppose that the world is the basis of these things.

I think that they are:
- correct in one way
- but wrong in another way

This is because they speak of physicality in 2 ways.

1. Something becoming physical from abstraction
2. Something both being physical and abstract at the same time, either as actual with potentiality, or potential with actuality

<!-- but **not being in the same respect**: for it is possible for contraries to be the same thing **potentially** at the same time, but **not actually**. -->

I think they are supposing some **other kind of substance** among existing things, which is beyond movement or destruction or coming-into-being at all.



## The System of Democritus and Empedocles

Democritus believes in the truth of appearances through **sensible things**. 

His followers think that the true should be judged not by instances.

This is because a sweet thing can be bitter to others. 

Furthermore, animals and each person also experience contraries.*

{{< n n="This is explained by samskara and mental shape, which is lacking in Greek philosophy" >}}

<!-- **Which of these, then, are true or false, is unclear**: for the former are no more true than the latter, but equally so. -->

That is why **Democritus** says that either **nothing is true** or **unclear to us**. 

They believe that:
- **perception is wisdom**
- this perception is **alteration**
- what appears through perception is **necessarily true**

**Empedocles** says that as men change their bodily state, they change their understanding:
- 'For to men **understanding** grows according to what is present.'

Yet in other places he says:
- 'And in proportion as they were changed in nature, **so did their thought always change** in its nature.'

**Parmenides** declares in the same manner:
- The mind which thinks is like the limbs that walk 
- The more that is perceived in everything, the more is the thought


**Anaxagoras** said that that existing things would be for them **such as they supposed them to be**.

The supporters of Anaxagoras say that **Homer** has this opinion too, because he described Hector, when he was stunned by the blow, as lying there **'with a changed mind'**
- This implies that even those who are mad possess understanding, but not the same kind.

If both are forms of understanding exist, then things are simultaneously so and not so.*

This is where the consequence is most difficult.

It means some have more truth and others who are seeking it have less. 

Then **how is it not right for those attempting to philosophize to lose heart?** 

For to seek the truth would be like **chasing after flying things**."
