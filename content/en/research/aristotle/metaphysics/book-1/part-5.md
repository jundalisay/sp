Contemporaneously and before these philosophers were the Pythagoreans. 

They were the first to take up mathematics. They advanced it and made it the principle of all things. 

In these principles, numbers are by nature the first. 

In numbers they seemed to see many resemblances to the things that exist and come into being-more than in fire and earth and water (such and such a modification of numbers being justice, another being soul and reason, another being opportunity-and similarly almost all other things being numerically expressible).

Since, again, they saw that the modifications and the ratios of the musical scales were expressible in numbers;-since, then, all other things seemed in their whole nature to be modelled on numbers, and numbers seemed to be the first things in the whole of nature, they supposed the elements of numbers to be the elements of all things, and the whole heaven to be a musical scale and a number. 

All the properties of numbers and scales which they could show to agree with the attributes and parts and the whole arrangement of the heavens, they collected and fitted into their scheme; and if there was a gap anywhere, they readily made additions so as to make their whole theory coherent. 

For example, as the number 10 is thought to be perfect and to comprise the whole nature of numbers, they say that the bodies which move through the heavens are ten, but as the visible bodies are only nine, to meet this they invent a tenth--the 'counter-earth'. 

We have discussed these matters more exactly elsewhere.

"But the object of our review is that we may learn from these philosophers also what they suppose to be the principles and how these fall under the causes we have named. Evidently, then, 

The Pythagoerans also believe:
- that number is the principle both as matter for things and as forming both their modifications and their permanent 
- that the elements of number are the even and the odd, and that of these the latter is limited, and the former unlimited; and that the One proceeds from both of these (for it is both even and odd), and number from the One; and that the whole heaven, as has been said, is numbers.

Other Pythagoreans say there are 10 principles, arranged in duality:
- limit and unlimited
- odd and even
- one and plurality
- right and left
- male and female
- resting and moving
- straight and curved
- light and darkness
- good and bad
- square and oblong. 

Alcmaeon of Croton also believed in this. He either got it from the Pythagoreans or they got it from him. 

He says most human affairs go in pairs.

These pairs are:
- not the definite contrarieties that the Pythagoreans speak of.
- any chance contrarieties, e.g. white and black, sweet and bitter, good and bad, great and small. 

He threw out indefinite suggestions about the other contrarieties.

But the Pythagoreans declared how many and which their contraricties are.

Both schools teach that the contraries are the principles of things.
- how many these principles are and which they are, we can learn from one of the two schools. But how these principles can be brought together under the causes we have named has not been clearly and articulately stated by them; 

They seem to classify the elements under matter.

 for out of these as immanent parts they say substance is composed and moulded.

The ancients said that the elements of nature were more than one.

But some spoke of the universe as if it were one entity.

 <!-- though they were not all alike either in the excellence of their statement or in its conformity to the facts of nature.  -->

<!-- The discussion of them is in no way appropriate to our present investigation of causes, for. they do not, like some of  -->

The natural philosophers assume being to be one and yet generate it out of the one as out of matter.

The natural philosophers add change, since they generate the universe.

But the ancient philosphers say the universe is unchangeable. 

Parmenides sticks to the One by definition.
- He says that the One is limited

Melissus sticks to the one in matter.
- He says that the One is unlimited

Xenophanes, pupil of Parmenides, is the first of these partisans of the One.
- He gave no clear statement.
<!-- , nor does he seem to have grasped the nature of either of these causes, but  -->
- With reference to the whole material universe he says the One is God. 


Xenophanes and Melissus are too naive and so they must be neglected entirely. 

Parmenides speaks with more insight. He claims that:
- only existent things exist and
- nothing non-existent exists

He thinks that things exist out of necessity= the existent and nothing else

<!--  (on this we have spoken more clearly in our work on nature), but being forced to follow the observed facts, and supposing the existence of that which is one in definition, but more than one according to our sensations,  -->

He then posits 2 causes and 2 principles calling them hot and cold.

He classifies:
- the hot with the existent
- the cold with the non-existent

This is after he takes into account our sensations of the existing things. 

The earliest philosophers regard the first principle as corporeal for water and fire and such things are bodies.

Some suppose that there is one corporeal principle.

Others suppose that there are more than one.

But both put these are classified as under matter.

Some posit matter as both this cause and this the source of movement.

 <!-- which we have got from some as single and from others as twofold. -->

The Italian school has treated these subjects rather obscurely. 

They have used 2 kinds of cause, and one of these-the source of movement-some treat as one and others as two. 

The Pythagoreans also believe in 2 principles. 

But they added that finity and infinity were not attributes of certain other things. For example, of fire or earth.

Instead, infinity itself and unity itself were the substance of the things of which they are predicated. 

This is why number was the substance of all things. 

<!-- On this subject, then, they expressed themselves thus; and regarding the question of essence they began to make statements and definitions, but treated the matter too simply.  -->

They both defined superficially and thought that the first subject of which a given definition was predicable was the substance of the thing defined, as if one supposed that 'double' and '2' were the same.

This was because 2 is the first thing of which 'double' is predicable. 

But surely to be double and to be 2 are not the same; if they are, one thing will be many-a consequence which they actually drew.
