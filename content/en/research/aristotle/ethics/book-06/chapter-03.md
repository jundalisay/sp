Commencing then from the point stated above we will now speak of these Excellences again. Let those  


The Soul attains truth in Affirmation or Negation through 5 faculties:[10]

1. Art
2. Knowledge
3. Practical Wisdom
4. Science
5. Intuition

(Supposition and Opinion I do not include, because by these one may go wrong.)

What Knowledge is, is plain from the following of considerations, if one is to speak accurately, instead of being led away by resemblances. 

For we all conceive that what we strictly speaking know, cannot be otherwise than it is, because as to those things which can be otherwise than they are, we are uncertain whether they are or are not, the moment they cease to be within the sphere of our actual observation.

So then, whatever comes within the range of Knowledge is by necessity, and therefore eternal.

This is because:
- all things exist exist necessarily
- all eternal things are without beginning and indestructible

All Knowledge can be taught.

All that comes within its range can be learned.

All teaching is based on previous knowledge. There are 2 ways of teaching: by Syllogism and by Induction.

Induction is the source of universal propositions.

Syllogism reasons from these universals.

Syllogism then may reason from principles which cannot be themselves proved Syllogistically: and therefore must by Induction.

So Knowledge is “a state or mental faculty apt to demonstrate syllogistically,” etc. as in the Analytics[13].

This is because a man knows when:
- he establishes his conclusion in a certain way
- the principles are known to him

For if they are not better known to him than the conclusion, such knowledge as he has will be merely accidental.

<!-- Let thus much be accepted as a definition of Knowledge. -->
