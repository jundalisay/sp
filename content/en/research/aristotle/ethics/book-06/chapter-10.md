There is too the faculty of Judiciousness, and also its absence, in virtue of which we call men Judicious or the contrary.

Judiciousness is:
- neither entirely identical with Knowledge or Opinion (for then all would have been Judicious).
- not a specific science, as medical science whose object is wholesome things

 <!-- or geometry whose object matter is magnitude: for it has not for  -->

The object of judiciousness is:
- not always existent or immutable or by chance; but those in respect of which a man might doubt and deliberate.
- the same Practical Wisdom

Yet judiciousness and wisdom are not identical

Practical Wisdom:
- can command and take the initiative
- its End is “what one should do or not do”

But Judiciousness:
- only decides on suggestions
- does not have Practical Wisdom
- happens when a man uses his knowledge
- employs the Opinionative faculty in judging things outside of Practical Wisdom

<!--  (though we do in Greek put “well” on to the faculty and its concrete noun, these really mean exactly the same as the plain words), and Judiciousness is neither the having , nor attaining it: but just as learning is termed συνιέναι 

, so judiciousness consists in 
 when another enunciates them; and not judging merely, but judging well (for εὐ and καλῶς mean exactly the same thing). And the Greek name of this faculty is derived from the use of the term συνιέναι in learning: μανθάνειν and συνιέναι being often used as synonymous. -->

The faculty called γνώμη,[40] in right of which we call men εὐγνώμονες, or say they have γνώμη, is “the right judgment of the equitable man.” 

A proof of which is that we most commonly say that the equitable man has a tendency to make allowance, and the making allowance in certain cases is equitable. And συγγνώμη (the word denoting allowance) is right γνώμη having a capacity of making equitable decisions, By “right” I mean that of the Truthful man.
