## Chapter 2

Every premise states that something that exists or must exist or might exist as the attribute of something else.

Of these 3 kinds, some are affirmative, others negative, in respect of each of the 3 modes of attribution.

Some affirmative and negative premises are universal, others particular, others indefinite.

In universal attribution, the terms of the negative premise should be convertible. For example, if no pleasure is good, then no good will be pleasure.

The terms of the affirmative must be convertible, not universally, but in part. For example, if every pleasure is good, some good must be pleasure.

The particular affirmative must convert in part. For if some pleasure is good, then some good will be pleasure).

But the particular negative need not convert, for if some animal is not man, it does not follow that some man is not animal.

First, then take a universal negative with the terms A and B. 

If no B is A, neither can any A be B.

For if some A (say C) were B, it would not be true that no B is A; for C is a B. 

But if every B is A then some A is B. 

For if no A were B, then no B could be A. 

But we assumed that every B is A. 

Similarly too, if the premise is particular. For if some B is A, then some of the As must be B.

For if none were, then no B would be A. But if some B is not A, there is no necessity that some of the As should not be B; e.g. let B stand for animal and A for man. 

Not every animal is a man; but every man is an animal.
