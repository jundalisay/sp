### Chapter 39

We should also exchange terms which have the same value, word for word, and phrase for
phrase, and word and phrase, and always take a word in preference to a phrase: for thus the
setting out of the terms will be easier. For example if it makes no difference whether we say that
the supposable is not the genus of the opinable or that the opinable is not identical with a
particular kind of supposable (for what is meant is the same in both statements), it is better to
take as the terms the supposable and the opinable in preference to the phrase suggested.


### Chapter 40

Since the expressions 'pleasure is good' and 'pleasure is the good' are not identical, we must not
set out the terms in the same way; but if the syllogism is to prove that pleasure is the good, the
term must be 'the good', but if the object is to prove that pleasure is good, the term will be 'good'. Similarly in all other cases.


### Chapter 41

It is not the same, either in fact or in speech, that A belongs to all of that to which B belongs, and that A belongs to all of that to all of which B belongs: for nothing prevents B from belonging to C, though not to all C: e.g. let B stand for beautiful, and C for white. If beauty belongs to something white, it is true to say that beauty belongs to that which is white; but not perhaps to everything that is white. If then A belongs to B, but not to everything of which B is predicated, then whether B belongs to all C or merely belongs to C, it is not necessary that A should belong,

I do not say to all C, but even to C at all. But if A belongs to everything of which B is truly stated, it will follow that A can be said of all of that of all of which B is said. If however A is said of that of all of which B may be said, nothing prevents B belonging to C, and yet A not belonging to all C or to any C at all. If then we take three terms it is clear that the expression 'A is said of all of which B is said' means this, 'A is said of all the things of which B is said'.

And if B is said of all of a third term, so also is A: but if B is not said of all of the third term, there is no necessity that A should be said of all of it.

We must not suppose that something absurd results through setting out the terms: for we do not use the existence of this particular thing, but imitate the geometrician who says that 'this line a foot long' or 'this straight line' or 'this line without breadth' exists although it does not, but does not use the diagrams in the sense that he reasons from them. For in general, if two things are not related as whole to part and part to whole, the prover does not prove from them, and so no syllogism a is formed. We (I mean the learner) use the process of setting out terms like perception by sense, not as though it were impossible to demonstrate without these illustrative terms, as it is to demonstrate without the premises of the syllogism.
