Whenever A may possibly belong to all B, and B to all C, there will be a perfect syllogism to
prove that A may possibly belong to all C. 

This is clear from the definition: for it was in this way that we explained 'to be possible for one term to belong to all of another'. 

Similarly if it is possible for A to belong no B, and for B to belong to all C, then it is possible for A to belong to no C. 

For the statement that it is possible for A not to belong to that of which B may be true
means (as we saw) that none of those things which can possibly fall under the term B is left out
of account. 

But whenever A may belong to all B, and B may belong to no C, then indeed no
syllogism results from the premises assumed, but if the premise BC is converted after the manner
of problematic propositions, the same syllogism results as before. For since it is possible that B
should belong to no C, it is possible also that it should belong to all C. This has been stated
above. 

Consequently if B is possible for all C, and A is possible for all B, the same syllogism
again results. 

Similarly if in both the premises the negative is joined with 'it is possible': e.g. if A may belong to none of the Bs, and B to none of the Cs. No syllogism results from the assumed premises, but if they are converted we shall have the same syllogism as before. 

Thus if the minor premise is negative, or if both premises are negative, either no syllogism results, or if one it is not perfect. 

For the necessity results from the conversion.

But if one of the premises is universal, the other particular, when the major premise is universal
there will be a perfect syllogism. For if A is possible for all B, and B for some C, then A is
possible for some C. This is clear from the definition of being possible. Again if A may belong to
no B, and B may belong to some of the Cs, it is necessary that A may possibly not belong to
some of the Cs. The proof is the same as above. But if the particular premise is negative, and the
universal is affirmative, the major still being universal and the minor particular, e.g. A is possible
for all B, B may possibly not belong to some C, then a clear syllogism does not result from the
assumed premises, but if the particular premise is converted and it is laid down that B possibly
may belong to some C, we shall have the same conclusion as before, as in the cases given at the
beginning.

But if the major premise is the minor universal, whether both are affirmative, or negative, or
different in quality, or if both are indefinite or particular, in no way will a syllogism be possible.
For nothing prevents B from reaching beyond A, so that as predicates cover unequal areas. Let C
be that by which B extends beyond A. To C it is not possible that A should belong-either to all or
to none or to some or not to some, since premises in the mode of possibility are convertible and it
is possible for B to belong to more things than A can. Further, this is obvious if we take terms;
for if the premises are as assumed, the major term is both possible for none of the minor and
must belong to all of it. 

Take as terms common to all the cases under consideration 'animal'-
'white'-'man', where the major belongs necessarily to the minor; 'animal'-'white'-'garment', where
it is not possible that the major should belong to the minor. It is clear then that if the terms are
related in this manner, no syllogism results. For every syllogism proves that something belongs
either simply or necessarily or possibly. 

There is no proof of the first or of the second. 

For the affirmative is destroyed by the negative, and the negative by the affirmative.
There remains the proof of possibility. But this is impossible. For it has been proved that if the
terms are related in this manner it is both necessary that the major should belong to all the minor
and not possible that it should belong to any. Consequently there cannot be a syllogism to prove
the possibility; for the necessary (as we stated) is not possible.

If the terms are universal in possible premises a syllogism always results in the
first figure, whether they are affirmative or negative, only a perfect syllogism results in the first case, an imperfect in the second. But possibility must be understood according to the definition
laid down, not as covering necessity. This is sometimes forgotten.
