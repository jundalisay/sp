### Chapter 13

Perhaps enough has been said about the proof of necessity, how it comes about and how it differs
from the proof of a simple statement. We proceed to discuss that which is possible, when and
how and by what means it can be proved. 

I use the terms 'to be possible' and 'the possible' of that which is not necessary but, being assumed, results in nothing impossible. 

We say ambiguously of the necessary that it is possible.

But that my definition of the possible is correct is clear from the phrases by which we deny or on the contrary affirm possibility. For the
expressions 'it is not possible to belong', 'it is impossible to belong', and 'it is necessary not to
belong' are either identical or follow from one another; consequently their opposites also, 'it is
possible to belong', 'it is not impossible to belong', and 'it is not necessary not to belong', will
either be identical or follow from one another. For of everything the affirmation or the denial
holds good. That which is possible then will be not necessary and that which is not necessary 
will be possible. 

It results that all premises in the mode of possibility are convertible into one
another. I mean not that the affirmative are convertible into the negative, but that those which are
affirmative in form admit of conversion by opposition, e.g. 'it is possible to belong' may be
converted into 'it is possible not to belong', and 'it is possible for A to belong to all B' into 'it is
possible for A to belong to no B' or 'not to all B', and 'it is possible for A to belong to some B'
into 'it is possible for A not to belong to some B'. And similarly the other propositions in this
mode can be converted. For since that which is possible is not necessary, and that which is not
necessary may possibly not belong, it is clear that if it is possible that A should belong to B, it is
possible also that it should not belong to B: and if it is possible that it should belong to all, it is
also possible that it should not belong to all. The same holds good in the case of particular
affirmations: for the proof is identical. And such premises are affirmative and not negative; for
'to be possible' is in the same rank as 'to be', as was said above.

Having made these distinctions we next point out that the expression 'to be possible' is used in
two ways. In one it means to happen generally and fall short of necessity, e.g. man's turning gray
or growing or decaying, or generally what naturally belongs to a thing (for this has not its
necessity unbroken, since man's existence is not continuous for ever, although if a man does
exist, it comes about either necessarily or generally). In another sense the expression means the
indefinite, which can be both thus and not thus, e.g. an animal's walking or an earthquake's
taking place while it is walking, or generally what happens by chance: for none of these inclines
by nature in the one way more than in the opposite.

That which is possible in each of its two senses is convertible into its opposite, not however in
the same way: but what is natural is convertible because it does not necessarily belong (for in
this sense it is possible that a man should not grow gray) and what is indefinite is convertible
because it inclines this way no more than that. Science and demonstrative syllogism are not
concerned with things which are indefinite, because the middle term is uncertain; but they are
concerned with things that are natural, and as a rule arguments and inquiries are made about
things which are possible in this sense. Syllogisms indeed can be made about the former, but it is
unusual at any rate to inquire about them.

These matters will be treated more definitely in the sequel; our business at present is to state the
moods and nature of the syllogism made from possible premises. The expression 'it is possible
for this to belong to that' may be understood in two senses: 'that' may mean either that to which
'that' belongs or that to which it may belong; for the expression 'A is possible of the subject of B'
means that it is possible either of that of which B is stated or of that of which B may possibly be
stated. 

It makes no difference whether we say, A is possible of the subject of B, or all B admits
of A. It is clear then that the expression 'A may possibly belong to all B' might be used in two
senses. First then we must state the nature and characteristics of the syllogism which arises if B
is possible of the subject of C, and A is possible of the subject of B. For thus both premises are
assumed in the mode of possibility; but whenever A is possible of that of which B is true, one
premise is a simple assertion, the other a problematic. Consequently we must start from premises
which are similar in form, as in the other cases.
