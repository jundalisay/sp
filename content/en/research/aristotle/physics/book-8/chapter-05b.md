Still more unreasonable is the consequence involved that, since everything that is moved
is moved by something that is itself moved by something else, everything that has a
capacity for causing motion has as such a corresponding capacity for being moved: i.e.
it will have a capacity for being moved in the sense in which one might say that everything that has a capacity for making healthy, and exercises that capacity, has as such a capacity for being made healthy, and that which has a capacity for building has as such a capacity for being built. 

It will have the capacity for being thus moved either immediately or through one or more links (as it will if, while everything that has a
capacity for causing motion has as such a capacity for being moved by something else,
the motion that it has the capacity for suffering is not that with which it affects what is
next to it, but a motion of a different kind; e.g. that which has a capacity for making
healthy might as such have a capacity for learn. the series, however, could be traced
back, as we said before, until at some time or other we arrived at the same kind of
motion). Now the first alternative is impossible, and the second is fantastic: it is absurd
that that which has a capacity for causing alteration should as such necessarily have a
capacity, let us say, for increase. It is not necessary, therefore, that that which is moved
should always be moved by something else that is itself moved by something else: so there will be an end to the series. 

Consequently the first thing that is in motion will  derive its motion either from something that is at rest or from itself. But if there were any need to consider which of the two, that which moves itself or that which is moved by something else, is the cause and principle of motion, every one would decide the former: for that which is itself independently a cause is always prior as a cause to that which is so only in virtue of being itself dependent upon something else that makes it so.

If a thing moves itself, how does it do it? 

Now everything that is in motion must be infinitely divisible, for it has been shown already in our general course on Physics, that everything that is essentially in motion is continuous.

It is impossible that that which moves itself should in its entirety move itself: for then, while being specifically
one and indivisible, it would as a Whole both undergo and cause the same locomotion
or alteration: thus it would at the same time be both teaching and being taught (the same
thing), or both restoring to and being restored to the same health. 

It is the movable that is moved. This is potentially, not actually, in motion, but the potential is in process to actuality, and motion is an incomplete actuality of the movable. 

The movent on the other hand is already in activity:
e.g. it is that which is hot that produces heat: in fact, that which produces the form is
always something that possesses it. 

Consequently, (if a thing can move itself as a whole),
the same thing in respect of the same thing may be at the same time both hot and not
hot. 

So, too, in every other case where the movent must be described by the same name in the same sense as the moved. 

Therefore when a thing moves itself it is one part of it
that is the movent and another part that is moved. But it is not self-moving in the sense
that each of the two parts is moved by the other part: the following considerations make
this evident. In the first place, if each of the two parts is to move the other, there will be
no first movent. 

If a thing is moved by a series of movents, that which is earlier in the series is more the cause of its being moved than that which comes next, and will be more truly the movent: for we found that there are two kinds of movent, that which is itself moved by something else and that which derives its motion from itself: and that which is further from the thing that is moved is nearer to the principle of motion than that which is intermediate. In the second place, there is no necessity for the movent part to be moved by anything but itself: so it can only be accidentally that the other part moves it in return.

I take then the possible case of its not moving it: then there will be a part that is moved and a part that is an unmoved movent. In the third place, there is no necessity for the movent to be moved in return: on the contrary the necessity that there should always be motion makes it necessary that there should be some movent that is either unmoved or moved by itself. In the fourth place we should then have a thing undergoing the same motion that it is causingthat which is producing heat, therefore, being heated. But as a matter of fact that which primarily moves itself cannot contain either a single part that moves itself or a number of parts each of which moves itself.

For, if the whole is moved by itself, it must be moved either by some part of itself or as a whole by itself as a whole. If, then, it is moved in virtue of some part of it being
moved by that part itself, it is this part that will be the primary self-movent, since, if this
part is separated from the whole, the part will still move itself, but the whole will do so
no longer. If on the other hand the whole is moved by itself as a whole, it must be
accidentally that the parts move themselves: and therefore, their self-motion not being
necessary, we may take the case of their not being moved by themselves.

Therefore in the whole of the thing we may distinguish that which imparts motion
without itself being moved and that which is moved: for only in this way is it possible
for a thing to be self-moved. 

Further, if the whole moves itself we may distinguish in it
that which imparts the motion and that which is moved: so while we say that AB is
moved by itself, we may also say that it is moved by A. 

Since that which imparts
motion may be either a thing that is moved by something else or a thing that is
unmoved, and that which is moved may be either a thing that imparts motion to
something else or a thing that does not, that which moves itself must be composed of
something that is unmoved but imparts motion and also of something that is moved but
does not necessarily impart motion but may or may not do so. 

Thus let A be something
that imparts motion but is unmoved, B something that is moved by A and moves G, G
something that is moved by B but moves nothing (granted that we eventually arrive at G
we may take it that there is only one intermediate term, though there may be more). Then
the whole ABG moves itself. But if I take away G, AB will move itself, A imparting
motion and B being moved, whereas G will not move itself or in fact be moved at all.
Nor again will BG move itself apart from A: for B imparts motion only through being
moved by something else, not through being moved by any part of itself. So only AB
moves itself. 

That which moves itself, therefore, must comprise something that imparts
motion but is unmoved and something that is moved but does not necessarily move
anything else: and each of these two things, or at any rate one of them, must be in
contact with the other. 

If, then, that which imparts motion is a continuous substance-that
which is moved must of course be so-it is clear that it is not through some part of the
whole being of such a nature as to be capable of moving itself that the whole moves
itself: it moves itself as a whole, both being moved and imparting motion through
containing a part that imparts motion and a part that is moved. It does not impart
motion as a whole nor is it moved as a whole: it is A alone that imparts motion and B
alone that is moved.

It is not true, further, that G is moved by A, which is impossible.
Here a difficulty arises: if something is taken away from A (supposing that that which
imparts motion but is unmoved is a continuous substance), or from B the part that is
moved, will the remainder of A continue to impart motion or the remainder of B
continue to be moved? 

If so, it will not be AB primarily that is moved by itself, since,
when something is taken away from AB, the remainder of AB will still continue to move
itself. Perhaps we may state the case thus: there is nothing to prevent each of the two
parts, or at any rate one of them, that which is moved, being divisible though actually
undivided, so that if it is divided it will not continue in the possession of the same
capacity: and so there is nothing to prevent self-motion residing primarily in things that
are potentially divisible.

Thus, that which primarily imparts motion is unmoved.

For, whether the series is closed at once by that which is in motion but moved by something else deriving its motion directly from the first unmoved, or whether the motion is derived from what is in motion but moves itself and stops its own motion, on
both suppositions we have the result that in all cases of things being in motion that
which primarily imparts motion is unmoved.
