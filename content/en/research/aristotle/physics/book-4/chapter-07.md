<!-- As a step towards settling which view is true, we must determine the meaning of the
name. -->

The void is place with nothing in it. 

<!-- The reason for this is that people take what exists to be body, and hold that while every body is in place, void is place in which there is no body, so that where there is no body, there must be  -->

This is because people say that:
- void exists because void is place that has no body.
  - So void is wherever there is no body. 
- every body is tangible and has weight or lightness.

Hence, by a syllogism, void is whatever that is weightless.

It would be absurd to suppose that the point is void.
- This is because the void must be place which has in it an interval in tangible body.

But at all events we observe then that in one way the void is described as what is not
full of body perceptible to touch.

Whatever has weight is perceptible to touch. 

So we would raise the question: what would they say of an interval that has colour or sound-is it void or not? 

They would reply that if it could receive what is tangible it was void, and if not, not.

In another way, void is that in which there is no ‘this’ or corporeal substance.

So some say that the void is the matter of the body (they identify the place, too, with this), and in this they speak incorrectly; for the matter is not separable from the things, but they are inquiring about the void as about something separable.

<!-- Since we have determined the nature of place, and  -->

Void must, if it exists, be place deprived of body. 

<!-- and we have stated both in what sense place exists and in what sense
it does not, it is plain that on this showing  -->

Void does not exist either unseparated or separated.

The void is meant to be, not body but rather an interval in body. 

This is why the void is thought to be something, viz. because place is, and for the same reasons. 

For the fact of motion in respect of place comes to the aid both of those who maintain that place is something over and above the bodies that come to occupy it, and of those who maintain that the void is something.

They state that the void is the condition of movement in the sense of that in which movement takes place; and this would be the kind of thing that some say place is. 

But there is no necessity for there being a void if there is movement. It is not in the least needed as a condition of movement in general, for a reason which, incidentally, escaped Melissus; viz. that the full can suffer qualitative change.

But not even movement in place involves a void.

This is because bodies may simultaneously make room for one another, though there is no interval separate and
apart from the bodies that are in movement. 

This is plain even in the rotation of continuous things, as in that of liquids.

Things can be compressed not into a void but because they squeeze out what is contained in them (as, for instance, when water is compressed the air within it is squeezed out).

Things can increase in size not only by the entrance of something but also by qualitative change; e.g. if water were to be transformed into air.

In general, both the argument about increase of size and that about water poured on to the ashes get in their own way. 

For either not any and every part of the body is increased, or bodies may be increased otherwise than by the addition of body, or there may be two bodies in the same place (in which case they are claiming to solve a quite general difficulty, but are not proving the existence of void), or the whole body must be void, if it is increased in every part and is increased by means of void. The same argument applies to the ashes.

It is easy to refute the arguments by which they prove the existence of the void.
