    sub: "The failure to find dark matter, prove quantum gravity, find wormholes/white holes are clear proofs of the fallacy of Relativity. All 'successful' tests of Relativity are just current measurements, not future-predicting ones like Newton's prediction of Halley's comet. Einstein really has set back science. If he never existsed humans would be using AI to explore the stars by now"
