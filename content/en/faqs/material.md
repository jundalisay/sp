What is Material Superphysics?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
It's the implementation of Superphysics in the realm of Physics. It's based on the 5 Elements, specifically the aether. This is the opposite of Physics which is based on matter, as mass. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What's wrong with Physics? It already works
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
It's incomplete. This is because it began with Newton who started from the lowest Element as matter (mass). Then, latter physicists groped their way upwards to Electromagnetism (light). 

The big problem for Physics is that 2 of the 5 Elements are non-physical -- spacetime and the aether.
{{< /l >}}


{{< youtube klka8xfvMDY >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Those 2 Elements lead to **a lot** of new technologies just as the Electromagnetic (Fire) Element led to television, internet, lighting, etc. Don't you want new technologies that can allow humans to go to other stars and galaxies?   
{{< /l >}}

{{< img src="/graphics/super/domains.svg" alt="2 Domains" >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Of course I want. But Physics in the 20th and 21st centuries has weirdly mutated into mere mathematics and theories.   
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
That's because Physics doesn't allow metaphysical perceptions. And so physicists have no choice but to make abstract geometrical theories such as String Theory which is useless.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How is Superphysics different?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
We allow the metaphysical domain which leads to the aether and a space called "aetherspace"
- The micro aetherspace manifests as gluon fields
- The macro aetherspace manifests as dark energy

These are both different from spacetime where local or normal motion happens.

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What's the aether? How is it different from the ether of 19th century Physics?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
The 19th century aether was the luminiferous aether of Fresnel, which is different from the original aether of Descartes and the ancient Greeks.

The original pure aether is the substance of ideas and the abstract mind or soul that has those ideas. These then generates reality, as matter and light, in real-time. This was explained by George Berkeley:
{{< /l >}}


{{< q a="George Berkeley" c="The Principles of Human Knowledge, Section 3" >}}
Things cannot have absolute Existence without any relation to their being perceived. They cannot have any Existence without the Minds which perceive them. I find it strange that people think that Houses, Mountains, and all sensible Objects have a Real Existence, distinct from their being perceived by the Understanding.
{{< /q >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So the universe is just inside our minds?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Yes! More correctly, the universe is a projection of our own minds, based on how it's programmed -- change your programming or belief and reality changes too.

The physical universe is based on the **configuration** of our metaphysical minds, as Descartes' mind-body problem.
{{< /l >}}


{{< youtube U4JFPWoiSAI >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Oh yeah, that was the Matrix idea in the [Superphysics FAQ](/faq). That strengthens the mind-over-matter way of thinking.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Yes! That's why we say Superphysics can solve all problems since the entire (observable) universe and all its problems are all rooted in the mind that is observing that universe and those problems.
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How can it solve quantum gravity and dark matter and the cosmology crisis, etc?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
First of all, anti-gravity, as telekinesis was already documented in ancient and medieval times outside of Europe. For example, levitating monks, weather control, and floating water (as splitting of the Red Sea) have been documented. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< q a="Marco Polo" c="The Travels of Marco Polo, Volume 1, Book 1, Chapter 61" >}}
When the Great Khan is at his great Palace, seated at his table, his cups are set before him in the middle of the hall 10 paces from his table. When he wants to drink, enchanters by the power of their enchantments cause the cups to move from their place without being touched by anybody, and to present themselves to him!

This everyone present may witness. There are often times more than 10,000 persons thus present. â€™Tis a truth and no lie! and so will tell you the sages of our own country who understand necromancy, for they also can perform it.
{{< /q >}}



{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Marco Polo points to Tibetan lamas as the experts in natural anti gravity. Incidentally, we learned about levitation through Hindu monks which use the same system as the lamas did.

Since it's a principle of Nature, then we looked for other cultures that knew it. Thankfully, we found that Rene Descartes already explained it through his concepts of the 2nd Element (vayu in Vedic Physics) and animal spirits (chi in Taoist Physics). 

These align with Asian Physics so we use them to explain everything from Newtoninan gravity, to black holes, dark mattter and baryonic acoustic oscillations.

These then lead to new technologies such as for levitation, teleportation, nuclear fusion (by levitating the plasma) and free energy among others.
{{< /l >}}


{{< youtube 7o5cXV7tDVA >}}




{{< r a="Asker" >}}
So Physics is unable to come up with such solutions because it doesn't account for mind, spirit, and non-Western principles?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Yes. It's sad really. 

To account for the metaphysics of minds, your own mind has to be open minded enough to expand itself to absorb new ideas. 

But the Westerners were dogmatized on one hand by Christianity which viewed the supernatural as evil, and by science which confined humans to  shallow sensory perceptions, denouncing the extrasensory ones as hallucinations or craziness.

But in Asia, such special powers are revered since people know how rare they are or how hard they are to acquire. 

Instead, Physics uses expensive hadron colliders and space telescopes to test gravity and dark matter, without success. 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Why do physicists keep on smashing atoms uselessly? They even have plans to make bigger and bigger colliders!
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
It's because they are materialists and materialists, like Democritus and Newton, enshrine matter -- they believe that gravity comes from matter. So they smash atoms to find that gravity or dark matter. But of course they find nothing. This is because gravity comes from the aether and not matter -- Nature is idealistic and not materialistic. 

The West came from the Romans who mastered matter in order to build a huge empire.

A common trait of matter-ialists (configuration of their minds) is they like money, gambling, and physical pleasures. This is why Newton invested in the stock market, but Descartes and Adam Smith did not.

This is opposite of the Hindus who renounced the world and made themselves terribly poor with fasting and voluntary poverty. Heck even the Buddha abandoned his wealth to go begging to reduce his ego. It would be like Elon Musk giving away his wealth so he can switch to teaching poor people for free on how to become industrialists.

In our MSQ model (alternative to the Standard Model), matter is the lowest and crudest Element or Layer, while the aether is the highest and subtlest.
{{< /l >}}

 <!-- the Higgs field is called "rib" as Radiant Internal Boundary. You can derive its properties from the model and don't need to build an expensive collider for it. -->
 
{{< img src="/graphics/physics/msq.jpg" alt="MSQ" >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What can your MSQ model do that the Standard Model cannot?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
It can create a roadmap for anti-gravity. This is because the aether is superior to spacetime. All you need is to figure out the properties of the aether in order to control spacetime. This is/had been already done by:
- levitating Buddhist monks
- UFOs that zip without any warping of spacetime
- ancient Egyptians who made pyramid blocks lighter through the aether
- Jews who increased the gravity of the wall of Jericho
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Oh materialists and physicists will denounce those as pseudoscience and call you a crackpot. Are you ok with that?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
They can denounce it all they want. But we will move forward anyway especially since we've already had samadhi (a direct experience of the Supreme or of the Creator of the Universe). People are free to choose to remain stuck with limited 5-sense Science or move forward and understand all of the Universe (as the physical body of the Supreme) through 6-sense Superphysics. 

If humans want to go to other planets and stars (which is impossible with any rocket technology of current science) then they have to make the switch to Superphysics. 

Bob Lazar already explained how UFOs use gravity waves and antimatter reactors. These are impossible with Newtonian Physics, but very possible with Cartesian Physics through the concept of aetherspace and material vortices.
{{< /l >}}


{{< youtube 0dXvYASaIx4 >}}


{{< r a="Asker" >}}
What's the status of Material Superphysics now?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
We already finished our prelevitation experiments using home equipment during the pandemic. Prelevitation is making things lighter without actually levitating.

However, we don't have the expensive equipment needed to make it levitate. To get those resources, we are slowly building up the moneyless system of Superpeconomics. This is because Material Superphysics proposes so many inventions. Relying on money won't be sustainable because money is static and always needs returns. By going moneyless, we can sustain the dynamism of resource gathering.

Our experiments have helped us understand the nature of the aether better. This is essential for Bio Superphysics which taps the aethereal animal spirits of Rene Descartes.
{{< /l >}}



{{< r a="Asker" >}}
Cool. You are using the moneyless system of Adam Smith to support the aether-based Physics of Descartes-Spinoza, which also works for Biology.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Yes. This is the really cool thing about Descartes. He explained how everything works, whether physical, biological, medical, or psychological.

Ideally, Newton should have built his Physics on top of Descartes' instead of totally replacing it. We are only against Einstein, not Newton who correctly believed that gravity comes from Spirit.  
{{< /l >}}


{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica, General Scholium" >}}
A Spirit pervades and lies hidden in all gross bodies. Its action and force causes the particles of bodies to:
- mutually attract one another at near distances (electric bodies operate farther)
- cohere if contiguous
- emit light and heat bodies

All animal bodies move at the command of the will through the vibrations of this Spirit. 
- these vibrations travel from our sense organs to the brain
- from the brain to the muscles

My work can lay the foundation to discover how this Spirit operates.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- Spinoza then builds on it to explain politics. -->


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
Modern researchers think that Newton's spirit was electricity. But this is false because the electrical nature of nerves wouldn't be theorized until Volta and Galvani much later. Instead, Newton's spirits refer to Descartes' animal spirits which go through the nerves and create electrical impulses as effects i.e. plants also use it through fluid channels without needing nerves
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
How would you unify Newton's Physics with that of Descartes? 
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
- Newton's Physics is all about the 3rd Element which we call the Material Layer in Superphysics. 
- Maxwell's Physics is about the 1st Element which we call the Radiant Layer.
<!-- - Einstein's Physics is the outer edge of the the Radiant layer where it is by barred off by the Spatial (spacetime) layer. This is why light is limited to 300,000 kilometers per second by the spacetime where it is in.    -->

So we unify all those Physicses by putting them inside the 5 Elements model. Then from there work on the 2 remaining Elements: spacetime and aether. 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Asker" >}}
If radio, TV, internet are the possible technologies from Electromagnetism / 1st Element / Radiant Layer, then what are the technologies that you foresee will be possible with those 2 new elements or layers?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Material Superphysics" >}}
A lot. For now, we have listed:
- Fire suppression and stopping nuclear chain reactions through the aether
- Earthquake forecasting through the aether
- Room temperature superconductors through the aether
- Crystal computers (to overcome Moore's law limitations)
- Metallurgy and precision metals fabrication through the aether
- UFO Technology as Anti-gravity (which Descartes calls 'levity') and semi-levity (making things lighter), Fusion power from levity, Transparency and Teleportation of masses through the aetherspace, Anti-matter via reversed vortices, Solar eye observatory (getting the gravitational signature of heavenly bodies)
