A fractal is an infinitely complex geometric shape with a repeating pattern that is self-similar across different scales. This means that if you zoom in on a part of a fractal, it will look similar to the whole image. Fractals are found in nature, such as in coastlines, snowflakes, and tree branches, and can be generated through repeating a simple mathematical process.
