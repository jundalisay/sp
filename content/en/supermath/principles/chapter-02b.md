## Constants

Constants are fixed ratios in our current universe. A base-6 system will make them better fit with each other just as a jigsaw puzzle made of squares will make a more fitting puzzle than one of pentagons or octagons.

--- | --- | --- 
circle | 100 | 360
pi | 3.05022041051413110312 or 3.0555..  |  3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197

## Pegging Time to Material Oscillations

Humans (as well as animals) can have widely differing opinions becacuse these are made up of aethereal souls which inherit some of the arbitrariness of the aether. 

The more advanced the soul is, the more differences it has from others. To keep those differences harmonious, all souls in physical reality need a common basis in matter, which is the crudest layer or Element.

We can expect that a hydrogen atom in our solar system will have the same properties in all solar system and all galaxies. 

The differences in matter in other galaxies is that their aetherspaces might allow more elements and isotopes leading to different chemistries and materials. An example is Element 115 of the Grays as explained by Bob Lazar.

This makes material oscillations, as the vibrations of their aetherspace, the best basis for measures. 
- The aetherspace is the uppermost observable layer
- Matter is the lowermost layer

This creates a comprehensive measure that involves all physical phenomena.

These oscillations denote timespan as a specific number of oscillations to make 1 'blip' which is a bit shorter than a second.

The distance covered by light in a vacuum in 1 second is then the standard ruler as 1 light second, called a span. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/span.jpg" a="Distance" >}}

This linear distance is in base-6 just the same as the convention for curves and circles. 

This reduces a base-10 meter to 0.826 meters. This replaces an inch with a 0.1 femtodisance which is tentatively 2.3 cm. 



## Geometries

Vortex numbers excel in geometries. This is because Cartesian Physics emphasizes particle shapes instead of the paths that the particles take i.e. the paths are the results of the shapes. So there is no need to burden oneself with tensors and differential geometry. 

Instead, the focus in on relative states or spins. 

For example, a new marriage of a man and woman with opposite spins will lead to separation. The system can predict when and whether the separation will be peaceful and amiable, or violent and homicidal. But it does not bother to predict the hour-by-hour activities until that separation happens.


<!-- As physical 
4t oscillations : 1 distance 
4,120,102 : 1 light distance : 1m distance
0.00000012305

1000000 (base 6) is equal to 46,656

Go to another star or galaxy, then get the time for Cesium to get 9 billion oscillations as your second. 

Then count the distance light travels in that second. 

Then cut up the distances to get

## Elements

Base-6 also explains the differences of the Elements

- Element 6 is carbon which is very important
- Element 12 Magnesium is different from Element 13 Aluminum
- The unstable elements begin at Element 84 Polonium which is 220 in base-6
