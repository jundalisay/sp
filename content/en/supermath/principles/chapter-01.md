Material Superphysics explained the 3 actions of the aether that is the effect of the 3 Influences.

1. Flow (association, expansion)

The flow includes logic or how the mind naturally jumps from one idea to another, even without thinking.
- Thinking makes the jumping more forceful, which is really just adding to the flow

2. Force (attraction / repulsion)

Quantification or digitization or digitalization is an effect of the repulsion to the continuous analog flow. 

Quantification creates instances that are notated as numbers. 

This arises from counting discrete identities as instances. 

This makes each instance or number a unique identity itself, each with its own quality that is revealed when they are processed with other identities. 


3. Memory or storage

This takes the form of notation. 


We call these 3 the operations of the mind.


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Enquiry, Section 1" >}}
It is remarkable concerning the operations of the mind, that, though most intimately present to us, yet, whenever they become the object of reflexion, they seem obscure. It becomes, therefore, no inconsiderable part of science barely:
- to know the different operations of the mind
- to separate them from each other
- to class them under their proper heads
- to correct all that seeming disorder, in which they lie involved, when made the object of reflexion and enquiry. 
{{< /q >}}



Mathematics uses these 3 operations of the mind as quantification, notation, and flow.

<!-- to is a flow of quantification to make sense of the analog flow.  -->


## The Four Operations of Arithmetic on Instances

Arithmetic is the basic core of mathematics that uses 4 operations from the flow which matches the 4 properties of waves:

1. Addition as 1st Property of Waves

The 1st Property of Waves is "no void". This is fulfilled by addition which adds onto the instances. This is like making a line move forward.

2. Division is the 2nd Property of Waves

The 2nd Property of Waves is frequency. A sound can be divided into smaller parts.  

3. Subtraction as the 3rd Property of Waves 

The 3rd Property of Waves is amplitude. A wave can have positive and negative values as it goes up and down.

4. Multiplication as the 4th Property of Waves 

The 4th Property of Waves is forward movement. Multiplication expands just as division contracts. 

Addition and Subtraction can start from zero just as a wave can shave an origin or middle point.

Division and Multiplication need a pre-existing instance, just as a frequency needs an existing wave, and expansion needs something to expand.
