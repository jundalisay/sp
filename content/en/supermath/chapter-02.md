A number is an instance of an identity. 

"Instance" is Latin *instantia*, meaning presence. This is consistent with our perception-based Superphysics. 

We can say that:
- 1 tomato is one instance of a tomato-identity. 
- 3 tomatoes are 3 instances of the tomato. 

Sometimes, numbers are used by themselves without any physical object. 

For example `1 + 1 = 2` uses pure instances. It adds 1 instance to another instance to come up with 2 instances. 

The mind assigs a new identity or name to this "2-instance instance" as the number 2. 

There are an infinite number of instances, and so the mind would have to assign new identities to each instance, which is then has to remember.

Since the mind's memory capacity is infinite, it groups the identities into repeatable patterns using the same base identities. 

Humans have settled for base-10 as its grouping. For example, instead of writing arbitrary symbols up to infinity such as:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ùÑû, ùÑ¢, ùÑ¨, ùÑÆ, ùÖü,..
```

We could simply reuse the names of the identities by grouping them into 10:

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15..
```

This makes sense since humans have 10 fingers. So each finger represents an instance of identity.


### Base 6

But since there are 5 Elements and not 10, it's better to use base-6

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21..
```

But this is confusing to people who have been used to base-10. So we use totally different symbols for the numbers based on the keyboard:

```
!, @, #, $, %, !0, !@, !#, !$, !%, @0, @1..
```

In this way, `! + ! = @`. More properly, it is `! + ! :: @`.

Vortex numbers are base-6 instances that can make geometry easier and less irrational.

It helps explain the relationship between the constants. 


## Constants

Constants are fixed ratios in our current universe.

Constant | Value Base 6 | Value Base 10
--- | --- | --- 
circle | 100 | 360
pi | 3.05022041051413110312 or 3.0555..  |  3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197

speed of light | 299,792,458 | 45,425,332,014
second | 4,120,102,000,230 (4,120,102,000,000) | 9,192,631,770 (9,192,631,760 modified to clean base 6)
second in a day | 86,400 | 1,504,400
Newton's G (spacetime to matter) | 0.0000000000510505 | 0.0000000000667430

<!-- convert 4,120,102,000,000 (base 6) to base 10 is 9,192,631,760-->

## Pegging Time to Material Oscillations

Humans (as well as animals) can have widely differing opinions becacuse these are made up of aethereal souls which inherit some of the arbitrariness of the aether. 

The more advanced the soul is, the more differences it has from others. To keep those differences harmonious, all souls in physical reality need a common basis in matter, which is the crudest layer or Element.

We can expect that a hydrogen atom in our solar system will have the same properties in all solar system and all galaxies. 

The differences in matter in other galaxies is that their aetherspaces might allow more elements and isotopes leading to different chemistries and materials. 

This makes material oscillations, as the vibrations of their aetherspace, the best basis for measures. 
- The aetherspace is the uppermost observable layer
- Matter is the lowermost layer

This creates a comprehensive measure that involves all physical phenomena.

These oscillations denote timespan as a specific number of oscillations to make 1 second. 

The distance covered by light in a vacuum in 1 second is then the standard ruler as 1 light second, called a distance. 

This linear distance is in base-6 just the same as the convention for curves and circles. 

This reduces a base-10 meter to 0.826 meters. This replaces an inch with a 0.1 femtodisance which is tentatively 2.3 cm. 


<!-- As physical 
4t oscillations : 1 distance 
4,120,102 : 1 light distance : 1m distance
0.00000012305

1000000 (base 6) is equal to 46,656


Go to another star or galaxy, then get the time for Cesium to get 9 billion oscillations as your second. 

Then count the distance light travels in that second. 

Then cut up the distances to get

## Elements

Base-6 also explains the differences of the Elements

- Element 6 is carbon which is very important
- Element 12 Magnesium is different from Element 13 Aluminum
- The unstable elements begin at Element 84 Polonium which is 220 in base-6
