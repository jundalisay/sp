In our Fallacies section, we explained the core flaw of Einstein's Relativity as the Simultaneity of Time.

This makes light and electromagnetism as superior to spacetime which is totally opposite of what Nature intended. 

<!--  the previous post, we fixed relativity* by adhering to the rules** which Socrates*** mentioned earlier:
- Photons must not be used to build the solution
- There must be no constant 
- The solution and cause of movement must be inherent to the object, as opposed to being external
- The solution must be universal, that is, applicable to all five layers of the Greek or Asian model of Earth, Water, Fire, Air, and Ether 

> **This adherence of logic to timeless metaphysical truths is the key aspect of the dialectical method that makes it different from the scientific method which is based on evidence supplied by the limited physical senses.

> ***Our solution-framework comes from Asia as levitating Buddhist monks. The problem is that humans see it as mysticism. So we had to find a known Western framework that matches it, and found it in Pythagoras. But Pythagoras is still pseudoscience to the religion of Scientism, and so we use Socrates as a compromise. Anyone who says that Socrates is pseudoscience will have to say that governments and laws are pseudoscience.  -->

We see that General Relativity cannot really extend to the Spatial layer because its domain is fundamentally in Electromagnetism as a consequence of being totally light-based.

Likewise, Classical Mechanics is applicable only to the Material layer since it only deals with material bodies such as apples and planets. 

Galaxies are not fundamentally material nor electromagentic. They do not act like balls that explode or push each other away when they collide. Instead, they pass through each other and eventually merge*.

<!-- We match the Standard Model of Physics to the 5-layer Model, originally called 5-elements, of the Greeks and Asia. We see that the theoretical advances in Physics in the 20th century are tiny compared to those from the 17th-19th centuries. The latter advanced a lot thanks to Newton correctly starting from the EM layer (3rd rank) through his work in optics, and then going up to the gravitational layer (2nd rank) through his use of optics to observe the movement of comets. 

However, Newton was unable to break through the ethereal layer (1st rank) because the metaphysics of the time were limited to bible verses*. Unable to break into the metaphysical layer, the minds of physicists have since declared it as off-limits and have gone instead downwards into the material layer where observation and prediction is so easy.

To Socrates, the metaphysical dimension is superior to the physical dimension, just as to Descartes, the aether is superior to matter. The aether is the material of the mind, idea (e.g. information), and feelings. 

This is why the concept of "mind over matter" is possible with Descartes, and has been used by monks to levitate.


## Cartesian Relationality: Getting Rid of c

To push "mind over matter", we get rid of the limitation imposed by the constant speed of light by assigning time as a mental object instead of a physical one. 

This makes c vary over time. For example, the speed of light in  and the speed of light in 1729 was different from that of 1983. Even nowadays, we often say that the speed of light is 300,000,000 meters per second instead of 299,792,458. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/aether.jpg" a="aether drag" >}}

This means that the speed of light is subjective, depending on the mind of the person you are talking to.

We replace this with a subjective `s` as the spatial speed limit* of the universe so that E :: ms{{< s v="2" >}}. 

This means that:
- spacetime is the one confining light to 300,000 kilometers per second
- the aetherspace is the one confining spacetime

This will make gravitation subordinate to the aether instead of to light, in accordance with our 5-layer model.

For the active version, we:
- convert the stress-energy tensor into the Kepler Tensor `G1` following Kepler's laws (as well as those of Socrates, Hume, Adam Smith, Ibn-Khaldun, Spinoza)
- convert the Einstein tensor as a ratio or relativity `:` of the identity in question to another identity 
- convert the constants into the limiter `s` as the limits of physical space
- remove light `c` which makes the cosmological constant `Î›` unnecessary 
- put everthing inside a Cartesian view which imposes obervation and timespans, consequently the timeline


{{< img alt="Cartesian Relationality" src="/graphics/physics/gr.jpg" cap="Material Superphysics converts Physics equations into ratios, since everything is relative and nothing, except the Absolute Entity, is absolute" >}}


We call this "Cartesian Relationality".


{{< i a="Cartesian Relationality" s="/graphics/physics/relationality.jpg" c="" >}}


Superphysics sees the universe as a Matrix or huge computer program (or the Mind of Brahma). 

Cartesian Relationality can be thought of as a [model-view-controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm:

MVC | Component | Metaphysical Equivalent
--- | --- | ---
**Model** | The gravitational signatures having a relation to other signatures | This is the idea for the thing
**View** | The Cartesian View | This is physical existence of the thing as real data
**Controller** | This is `s` or the limiter | This is how the thing interacts in reality

We not only use the word 'relationality' to prevent Descartes' Relativity from getting mixed up with that of Einstein, but also because it uses the Tables of Francis Bacon which are similar to a relational database. 


### Everything is Relational because There is no Void in Nature

Everything is related because every signature interacts* obviously or non-obviously with each other. The metaphysical thing that causes stars and dust to gather or disperse is the same thing that causes:
- people to form societies or leave society
- ideas to coalesce into complex ideas or be analyzed into their basic idea. 

This means that all forces are contact forces facilitated by the aether. This allows action-at-a-distance as seen in quantum mechanics because the aether is everywhere. 

To the aether, there is zero distance between bodies. In fact, quantum teleportation negates distance. 



##  So What's the Use of Cartesian Relationality?

Cartesian Relationality solves the following problems:

Phenomena | Explanation
--- | ---
[Dark matter](https://www.universetoday.com/150964/one-idea-to-explain-dark-matter-ultralight-bosons-fails-the-test/) | This is replaced by spatial vortices i.e. the pull of the galaxy is from its vortex
Dark Energy | This is replaced by the [splitting of qosts](/research/descartes/world/chapter-08) which manifests as the expansion of spacetime
Gravitational lensing | This is caused by the refraction of light by spatial vortices
Equivalence Principle | This is caused by vortex arms having the same speed a certain distances from the vortex


Practically, the knowledge of how these signatures work can allow humans to **harness any motion** since all motions are caused by space while being in space.

Currently, only the movements in the Material and Electromagnetic layer are harnessed by humans, more commonly as combustion and electric motors.

The power of spacetime, as anti-gravity, and the aetherspace, as teleportation, are unknown to modern humans because Newton assigned the cause of gravity to the material layer -- **opposite of how Nature arranged it!** 

This obsession with matter is then why physicists smash atoms to find what is inside them, wasting real effort and money in the process.  

Einstein actually stifled science by leading physicists on a wild-goose-chase for dark matter and wormholes. Satellite Engineers would discover discrepancies in the timings of their satellites anyway, which would then create relativity theories naturally without the limiting `c`.


## Asia to the Rescue

So far, only Buddhist and Hindu monks seem to have started properly from the Metaphysical Domain. This allowed them to use anti-gravity to levitate themselves by changing their relation to the Earth. 

{{< img alt="Buddhist metaphysics gravity" src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/a0b1.png" cap="Levitation has been practiced by floating monks in Tibet, floating UFOs in the US and Iran, and by the ancient Egyptians who levitated huge blocks to form the pyramids, using the same natural principle that expands the universe" >}}

Cartesian Relationality don't just work for movements in the five physical layers but also for movements in the metaphysical layer. This theory can help:

- move public opinon or feelings towards a policy proposal or political candidate by knowing the current G of society. Is your society headed for a golden age, or is it on a decline? This is the job of [Social Superphysics](/social)
- attract or retain the right employees or minds for your company and maximize their productivity by finding out their motivational G that might be different from the material particle called money. This is the job of [Economic Superphysics or Supereconomics](/social/economics)
- know how temporally far a person is from a disease by comparing his G with that of the disease, so that he can move away from or prevent the disease. This is the job of [Bio Superphysics](/bio)
- and so on..
