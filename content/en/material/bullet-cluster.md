## The Failure of General Relativity

In his book Relativity, Einstein explains [the proofs for General Relativity](/research/einstein/relativity/appendix-3), one of which is gravitational lensing -- light bending around a star.

He asserts that lensing is caused by mass: half of lensing is produced by the Newtonian gravitational field and the other half by the curvature of space caused by the sun.

This whole theory is debunked by the Bullet Cluster where lensing is produced without any mass. In it, 2 old galaxies collided, leaving behind their mass while the spacetime body moves forward.

The lensing happens mostly through the "dark" spacetime body.


## The Invention of Dark Matter

To save the theory (and their investment in the Relativity-belief), physicists theorize **dark matter**. This is merely because Newton said that gravity correlates with matter. 

Einstein builds on the Newtonian theory by saying that mass warps the space around it.

The big problem is that dark matter has never been found even after wasting millions of dollars and many years in the search.


Little do people know that Descartes had already explained lensing back in 1634 as an effect of invisible space vortices. 

These bend or refract light in a curve, as the light passes the vortex. This bending does not need matter, matching observations from telescopes. 

This is easily seen in the Bullet Cluster where the lensing happens mostly in the 2 dark vortices or spaces that are moving, without the mass.

Cartesian Physics predicts that the mass of each galaxy will follow its spacetime body since matter is a slave to spacetime. Matter needs spacetime, but spacetime does not need matter. 

We show this as a galaxy-to-matter band which says that matter can never escape its galaxy. This is what the computer simulation shows:

## The Religion of Physics

This is why Physics is like a religion where physicists refuse to change their beliefs even when faced with data from Nature. 

Instead, they bash the true Physics of Descartes as being unproven, when in reality, the physicists simply don't want to accept the proofs because of attachment to the wrong Physics.

And so humans stay stuck on Earth without any anti-gravity technology to explore the galaxy, as if Nature had a quality control against backward species to prevent dogma from spreading to other planets
