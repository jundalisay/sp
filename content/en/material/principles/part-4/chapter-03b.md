The Weak Force is most known by Modern Physics for particle decay. 


Sublayer | Name | Used in 
--- | --- | ---
Upper | Gamma | sterilization  
Mid | Beta | medical imaging
Lower | Alpha | smoke detectors


These are present in nuclear fission and fusion primarily through Beta decay. 


## Beta Plus (upgrade)

In Beta Plus decay when proton is more massie is upgraded to Neutron by adding aether as proven by the antielectron 

Proton --> Neutron

```
(Proton + Energy) : (Neutron + -qor + qoc) 
```


Emits:
- antielectron (e⁻)
- neutrino (ν̅e)



## Beta Minus 

In Beta Minus decay happens when neutron is more massive and is downgraded to Proton as as proven by the antineutrino

```
(Neutron + Energy) : (Proton + qor + -qoc) 
```

Emits:
- electron (e⁻)
- antineutrino (ν̅e)
