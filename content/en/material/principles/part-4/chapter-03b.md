The Weak Force is most known by Modern Physics for particle decay. 


Sublayer | Name | Used in 
--- | --- | ---
Upper | Gamma | sterilization  
Mid | Beta | medical imaging
Lower | Alpha | smoke detectors


These are present in nuclear fission and fusion primarily through Beta decay. 


## Radioactive Beta Decay

A nucleon decays in 3 ways:

1. Alpha

This happens when a particle emits alpha particles, as 2 soms (protons) and 2 socs (neutrons). These have low penetration power and so they are easily stopped. 

It damages the DNA such as the reduction of white blood cells which weakens the body's immunity. 


2. Beta 

This happens when a particle emits beta particles, as qors (electrons). These create less damage to the body than alpha particles. 


2.1. Beta Plus Decay

This is when a som (proton) turns into a soc (neutron) and releases a qoc (neutrino) and a -qor (positron)


2.2. Beta Minus Decay

This is when a soc (neutron) turns into a som (proton) and releases a -qoc (antineutrino) and a qor (electron). This is more common than beta plus decay.

This is used in Positron Emission Tomography.


3. Gamma 

This is releases a gamma ray which cannot be seen. 

Gamma rays are used in oncology to target tumors. 


<!-- Isotopes are the number of neutrons in a nucleon. This makes it part of the convertible layer -->

<!-- Beta Plus Decay happens when a proton turns into a neutron when energy is added.

This raises its aether beyond what is natural for a proton. 

This causes it to convert into a neutron. 

The excess aether is ejected into the aetherspace, creating a neutrino and a positron.

This also converts an up quark into a down quark.

This cancels out its rotation, giving it a neutral charge and added mass.

Beta Minus Decay happens when a neutron gives off its aether.

This reverses the process, turning it back to a proton, but creates an electron and anti neutrino instead.

<!-- ## Beta Plus (upgrade)

In Beta Plus decay when proton is more massie is upgraded to Neutron by adding aether as proven by the antielectron 

Proton - Neutron

```
(Proton + Energy) : (Neutron + -qor + qoc) 
```


Emits:
- antielectron (e⁻)
- neutrino (ν̅e)



## Beta Minus 

In Beta Minus decay happens when neutron is more massive and is downgraded to Proton as as proven by the antineutrino

```
(Neutron + Energy) : (Proton + qor + -qoc) 
```

Emits:
- electron (e⁻)
- antineutrino (ν̅e)
