Neutrons are the main substance of conversion (SOC2) mirroring the Proton which is the main substance of matter (SOM2). 

They change matter via decay just as protons make atoms and elements persist.

These are made up of 3 quarks.

### Neutron Stars

A neutron star is created when the internal fusion of a normal star stops, causing its gravity to collapse. 

This is because the spatial layer is superior to the radiant. This then makes the star's particles merge. 

- Electrons merge with the protons in the atomic nuclei, creating neutrons 
- In the process of merging, the star produces a lot of neutrinos
- After extreme collapse, the star explodes as a supernova in a stream of neutrinos
- This leaves behind a neutron star where the star was

Physics believes that a collapsing star will:
- turn into a neutron star or
- turn into a black hole  

As a neutron star, it can turn into a pulsar if the vortex energy is still strong. 

Young, energetic neutron stars are not so much affected by neighboring stars. These emit xrays and radiowaves. 

Magnetars are pulsars that are very energyetic. 

There are around 3,000 observable neutron stars in the our galaxy.
