## Intermolecular Forces

These are weak attractions such as hydrogen bonds that keep molecultes together.

Sublayer | Name | Examples
--- | --- | ---
Upper | London Dispersion Forces | Protein folding
Mid | Dipole–Dipole Forces | Hydrogen Bonding 
Lower | Ion–Dipole Forces | boiling poin


## London Dispersion Forces

This is the weakest type, but very important in nonpolar substances (e.g., liquid O₂, noble gases).


## Dipole–Dipole Forces

Between molecules that have permanent dipoles (polar molecules). Example: HCl–HCl

An example is hydrogen bonds.


## Ion-Dipole

This is between an ion and a polar molecule.

Example: Na⁺ ions interacting with water molecules in saltwater.
