The Convertible Layer is the fourth layer. It reconfigures the radiant layer in order to produce diversity in the material layer.

It manifests as radioactivity, chemical change, flavor changing, and is governed by the 'Weak Force' and graphically through Feynman diagrams.

While the radiant layer is the basis of electricity, optics, and electronics, and thus the electronics and computing industries, the convertible layer is the basis of chemistry, and thus the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  

In terms of creation, this is the fourth layer that processes energies and matter into other kinds.


### Definition of the Convertible Layer

This layer creates the **diversity** in the material universe. This has both dynamic and static parts. 

Its particles are made up of 2 aether particles. This makes it very unstable. This inherent instability lets it convert other particles, both radiant and material.

This layer was traditionally associated with water and liquids because they are always moving and can switch between gas, liquid, and solid. 

The importance of liquids in Conversion is seen in convertible quanta, as neutrinos, being detectable in liquid argon and chlorine. 

The conversion layer leads to chemistry, and bio-chemisty and organic chemisty when merged with Bio Superphysics.

<!-- This layer is also the least known by Physics because, like spacetime, it is dynamic and hard to detect.  -->
