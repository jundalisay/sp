The increase in global population requires a proportional increase in power generation. 

Currently, most of this is achieved through fossil fuels which dump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This then leads to global warming, manifesting as natural disasters such as typhoons, floods, and heat waves. In fact, July 22, 2024 was the hottest day on record. 

The current trend is unsustainable if the human species is to survive. For now, governments have been pushing for power sources that emit less greenhouse gases such as solar, wind, nuclear, and hydro power. But these have been proven to be inefficient, unreliable, expensive, or produce other kinds of waste.

Power Source | Problem
--- | ---
Wind | Not reliable, Select Locations only
Hydro | Not reliable, Select Locations only
Solar | Toxic Waste, Large Area Needed
Nuclear Fission | Nuclear Waste, Limited Uranium Supplies


Two new mechanisms can replace fossil fuels as a reliable energy source:

1. Nuclear Fusion

<!-- This is already used in large UFOs -->

2. Antimatter Reactors

<!-- This is used in small UFOs such as the 'sport model' mentioned by Bob Lazar. -->


While nuclear fusion is the future of large-scale power generation, such as those for cities, antimatter reactions are the future of small-scale power generation for buildings and vehicles, such as cargo ships, airplanes, and spaceships. 

The biggest fission-fusion H-bomb, the Tsar Bomba, yielded 50 megatons of TNT using 8 tons of uranium (a finite resource), whereas an antimatter bomb can create the same with just over 1 ton of antihydrogen.

In energy terms, 1 ton of antihydrogen is a much lighter and renewable battery than 8 tons of uranium. 


## The Problem with Physics

The problem is that physicists don't really know how antimatter is created. They just go with Einstein's `E=mc^2` and smash matter to get a zoo of particles, some of which are antimatter.

This leads to the current brute force approach:

1. Protons are gathered into an electromagnetic beam
2. The energy of the beam is increased through acceleration in cyclotrons from MeV to GeV
3. The beam is then smashed into an iridium block which is thought to receive "gluons" from the proton beam
4. Those gluons then magically convert to quarks and antiquarks which then interact with the other quarks to produce subatomic particles, some of which become antiprotons
5. The antiprotons are stored in electromagnetic decelerators

This whole approach is so inefficient and is why it will take 600,000,000 years to make 1 gram of antimatter.


## The Aetherspace Particle Solution

Cartesian-Spinoza Physics fixes this by pointing out the true binding mechanism of quarks is not the gluon, but the aetherspace particles around a proton, which are 3 in number.

{{< youtube Z5drrFf2ZVs >}}

Unlike normal space particles which allow linear movement, the aetherspace particles allow probabilistic movement. 

This is why electrons do not orbit the proton, but rather jump around it in a cloud. 

The gluon field is the center of this cloud, making up the center as the proton or neutron. 

These aetherspace particles surround the quarks, making them form a triangle which Physics calls gluon flux tubes. This triangle prevents internal movement and this is what makes solid bodies solid. 

When protons are smashed, these aetherspace particles break free from the triangle, converting from 'gluons' to 'mesons'. 

```
p + p → π+, π−, K+, K−, p, pˉ
```

All mesons, as pions, kaons, etc are made of particle and antiparticle pairs.

High energy collisions create antiprotons. Low energy collisions just makes mesons which fizzle out. 

In a way, the current method of antiproton production (for the Material Layer) is similar to splitting a photon by crystals (for the Radiant Layer).
- The crystal creates the flipped photon by splitting the photon


<!-- 1. Add Neutrons to an element 

In a normal decay, such as `γ +N → e+ + e− + N`, the aetherspace is conserved

3 + 2 = 3 -3 + 2

1. An aetherspace particle breaks up into 4 free-aethers. One binds with a quark (1 aether), causing it to upgrade into a Z boson (2 aethers). This leaves 3 free aethers available. 
2. The Z boson binds with 1 free aether, causing to upgrade into an electron (3 aethers). This leaves 2 free aethers. The "search" for that free aether is why the decay of the Z boson is not instantaneous.
3. The electron binds with 1 free aether to become a new aetherspace particle (4 aethers). This leaves 1 free aether.
4. The remaining free aether becomes a positron (anti-electron) in order to conserve the aethers.  

What Physics calls "particle decay" is really the successive upgrade of matter particles into space particles. This shows as quarks turning into other subatomic particles which then quickly disappear into space.   

It follows that antimatter, as manifestations of the free aether, is Nature's mechanism to conserve both the aether and energy as particles convert from one Standard Model particle to another.

This free aether is what Supersymmetry Theory was looking for in the large hadron collider but could never find since the aether cannot be detected by instruments.

Energy from Nature is used to produce antimatter which it then gives back to Nature when it comes in contact with matter. -->


## A Non Brute Force Approach to Producing Antimatter

Since the mechanism for antimatter is the aetherspace particle, and since antimatter is produced by reversing the spin of the aetherspace (in our analogy with the split photon), then the focus should be on how to flip the spin of the aetherspace of a proton. 

This flipping is done by adding energy to a proton via the aether, and then storing it after it has flipped. 

This allows energy to be materially transportable, different from electricity which requires wires or specific conditions for wireless (Nikola Tesla) transmission.
- Just convert proton to antiprotons at home.
- Then pack them in antimatter storage and use them wherever you like.  

This is why nuclear fusion and Tesla's global wireless energy transmission go together, just as antimatter power and UFOs do. 

This is done by Gray UFOs (i.e. the sport model mentioned by Bob Lazar)


## Semi-Unstable Element 115 

The Gray UFOs use a Semi-Unstable version of Element 115, very different from the current Element 115 created by humans.  

{{< youtube y--qXYtI_UA >}}

This means its aetherspaces of its isotopes are all nearly flipped so that the addition of a proton flips them all into antimatter which then collides with a gas to create energy. 

Instead of producing antiprotons by colliding protons with protons in a brute force high energy way, the better cheaper way is to use the aether to flip the aetherspace (or nearly flip them) of protons. 

This will make them semi-unstable which can be made fully unstable or unlocked by the addition of a proton, as explained by Bob Lazar.
