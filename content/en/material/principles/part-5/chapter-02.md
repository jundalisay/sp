The Material Layer is divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower Sublayers.

<!-- , with the Upper being made of waves, and the Lower being made up of particles. -->

Upper | Gas
Mid | Liquid 
Lower | Solid 


## The Material Internnal Boundary

Finding the common ratio of the Radiant and Convertible boundnaries lead to a ratio of 244,944 base 10 or 5130000 base 6.

And so we predict that a larger collider will expose a particle with 482 - 492 GeV mass which separates mesons and protons for the Strong Force or Earth Element. 

Physics will then wrongly call it as dark matter when it is really just as useless as the Higgs. 

It follows that the Future Circular Collider being built at a cost of $17b is a sheer waste of money. It is merely an expensive project to keep physicists employed in the Religion of Physics, just as a huge cathedral keeps priests employed.
