In 1924, Pauli introduced the concept of spin which he called "2-valuedness" as basis for the "Exclusion Principle" which was used to explain the anomalous Zeeman effect.

{{< q a="Pauli" c="Exclusion Principle and Quantum Mechanics" >}}
The physicists found it difficult to understand the exclusion principle since no meaning in terms of a model was given to the fourth degree of freedom of the electron. **The gap was filled by Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit’s idea of electron spin.** Through it, the anomalous Zeeman effect could be understood simply by assuming that:
- the spin quantum number of one electron is equal to 1⁄2
- the quotient of the magnetic moment to the mechanical angular moment has for the spin a value twice as large as for the ordinary orbit of the electron.

Spin was used to explain the varying light emission of electrons inside an atom. 

This spin was then used to an exclusion principle to separate non-force particles (leptons and baryons) such as electrons and force particles (bosons) such as photons.

The big problem was that the Pauli spin was created after the Einstein imposed the Relativity scam which says that nothing travels faster than light. 

And so physicists absurdly say that particles spin even if they don't. 

To fix this based on the Zeeman Effect, we interpret the light emission of electrons using Descartes' principles.


## The Zeeman Effect 

Atoms (called 3rd Element in Cartesian Physics) emit a light (called 1st Element) when put under magnetism (a flow of striated 1st Element particles).

This light sometimes splits into 3 bands, as a "Zeeman effect". This exposes the energy levels (Cartesian vortex orbits or paths) of the electron

Light also "anomalously" splits into 9. This exposes the energy levels of those orbits.

The original spin idea of Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit is consistent with the idea of Descartes that electrons (which he called minutiae) are spinning vortices. 

The main difference is that this spin is not limited to the speed of light. 

In Cartesian Theory, an electron can spin faster than light and it will merely change to another coordinate of space and time (i.e. instantly teleport to another space or teleport in time). 

<!-- This led to Pauli inventing the concept of spin which actually matchea the theory of spinning vortices of Descartes. -->


## Cartesian Vortex Theory

Descartes described all particles as spinning vortices having effective shapes as globules, corkscrews, rods, helixes, etc. 
- These shapes are an improvement of the Platonic shapes

Cartesian spin is either clockwise or anticlockwise, whether for:
- charges (positive/negative)
- gravity (gravity/antigravity)
- colors (towards red/violet)
- matter (matter/antimatter)
- DNA (RNA/DNA)
- societies (division/unity), etc

<!-- A peacful sociey has aligned or inclusive members. Examples are loving marriages, cohesive sports teams, golden ages. 

A warring society has non-aligned or exlcusive members. Examples are divorces, failed teams, dark ages. 

 and so it oscillates 
 -->

At this point, electron paths are no longer Newtonian-Classical since Newton never imagined orbits splitting split up.

But they are still Cartesian-Classical, just as a flow of water can split up into many smaller flows.

But since no one knew Cartesian Physics, Bohr and Pauli had to create a new field called Quantum Physics which was opposed to Newtonian.

Another big difference with the spin of Pauli and Descartes is that Pauli's spin is constrained by the `E=mc^2` dogma from the scammer Einstein.

This prevented him from thinking of electrons as spinning globules that go clockwise or anticlockwise.

Instead, he uses "integer" and "half-integer" which are numerical, not visual.

He replaces the easy concept of side-by-side or top-to-bottom particle orientation with overly complicated "symmetrical" and "antisymmetrical" wave functions.

German precision thus further corrupted Physics which was already corrupted by British matter-ialism. 


## The Nucleus as the Splitting Mechanism through the Aetherspace

Lorentz correctly guessed that the proton was the splitting mechanism. 

This is simiar to how the sun creates orbits. 

But the sun cannot anomalous orbits because it uses spacetime and not the aetherspace. 

The aetherspace is a totally different space that is linked to the aether just as electroweak is linked to electrons. 

Unfortunately, Lorentz could not explain how electron orbits could split because he also didn't know Cartesian Physics.
