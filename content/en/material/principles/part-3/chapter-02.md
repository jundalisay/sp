The Radiant Layer is divided into Upper, Middle, and Lower, with the Upper being made of waves, and the Lower being made up of particles. The boundary (Radiance Internal Boundary) is called the Higgs Field which gives electromagnetic potential to identities. 


Sublayer | Example | Quanta 
--- | --- | --- 
Upper | Light | Electron
Mid | Magnetism | Muon
Lower | Heat | Tau


The Upper Radiant is the electromagnetic spectrum as radiowaves, light, and ultraviolet. Its job is to relay inforation about the lower layers such as matter. 

The Middle Radiant is magnetism.

The Lower Radiant is Heat.


## The Radiant Internal Boundary: The "Higgs Field"

The 'Higgs field is the internal boundary within the Radiant Layer.

This separates those which have electromagnetic mass, such as electrons, with those that do not have mass, such as photons.
