Male and Female polarity is the effect of channels having an entrance and exit.

This entrance and exit is made possible because the radiant force particles rotate anticlockwise into the non-force particles that receive them and get their spin to spin themselves.

This force transfer is made possible by right handed threads that radiant particles have. 

This spin is what makes colors in light possible, manifesting as varying wavelengths.
