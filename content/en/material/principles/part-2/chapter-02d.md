Einstein fans say that he had an ether idea which cancels the emptiness of space. 

But they don't understand that his ether is just Newton's absolute space: "Newton could have called his absolute space as Ether." (Einstein)

Einstein's ether idea is from Mach who, like Newton, used it as an empty canvas for physical phenomena:

"The isolated bodies A, B, C.. play a colateral role in determining the motion of body K which is determined by the medium that K exists in. We should substitute this medium for Newton's absolute space." (Mach, Science of Mechanics)

This means that Einstein-Mach ether is useless: "No one is competent to predicate things about absolute space. They are pure things of thought" (Mach)

Descartes' aether, on the other hand, is the causal mechanism for all phenomena, as the substance of everything. 

Spinoza builds on this adding that this aethereal substance as the "backend" of the physical reality "frontend": "God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists" (Ethics, Part 1, Prop 11)

In Einstein's system, the universe is bound by a fixed boundary determined by matter.

In Descartes' system, the edge of the universe depends on the observer's aethereal mind.

For example, James Webb's mind had an aethereal desire to look farther into the cosmos. So he helped create the James Webb Space Telescope which actually expanded the age of the universe from 13.8b years to 26.7b.

Einstein's Relativity is based on the constant speed of light. But he is unable to explain why light has a fixed top speed. 

Huygens explains that that is the speed allowed by Cartesian space particles called the 2nd Element which have a wave-nature and so gives wave-properties to light.

Unlike Eisntein's universe which is bound by a useless ether, Descartes' universe is bound by the aetherspace which is determined by the observer himself.

This allows an unlimited, explorable universe.


Here, we show the operational difference between the Einstein-Mach ether versus the Descartes-Huygens-Plato aether (Spinoza-Aristotle substance) .

But this ether is very different from that of the ether of the mechanical wave-theory of light.

The ether of General Relativity is a medium which is itself devoid of all mechanical and kinematical qualities. But it helps to determine mechanical (and electromagnetic) events.

Mach Science of Mechanics I must here draw my readers' attention to a beautiful paper  

No one is competent to predicate things about absolute space and absolute motion; they are pure things of thought, pure mental constructs, that cannot be produced in experience. All our principles of mechanics are... experimental knowledge concerning the relative positions and motions of bodies. ...No one is warranted in extending these principles beyond the boundaries of experience. ...[S]uch an extension is meaningless, as no one possesses the requisite knowledge to make use of it.
