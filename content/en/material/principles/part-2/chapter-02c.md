In Material Superphysics, which is based on Cartesian Physics, the macro-aetherspace is part of the spatial layer that is above spacetime, but below timespace.

Sublayer | Media | Domain  | Phenomena 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Upper | Timespace | Quasi-Physical | Teleportation (via Electromagnetism)
Middle | Macro-Aetherspace | Quasi-Physical and Physical | Dark Energy
Lower | Spacetime | Physical | Gravity (via Matter), Dark Matter (via Light, Matter), Magnetism (via Electromagnetism) 

<!-- Atomic Space (empty space inside an atom) -->

The macro-aetherspace is now called dark energy which expands or contracts the spacetime below or within it. 

It is part of the aetherspace family which involves the Material Layer:

Layer | Name | Physics Name
--- | --- | ---
Spatial | Macro Aetherspace | Dark Energy
Material | Aetherspace | Atomic Space (empty space inside an atom)
Material | Micro Aetherspace | Gluon Field (empty space inside a proton)

The job of the aetherspace is to separate identities.

- As dark energy, it separates universes and spacetime slices from each other
- As atomic space, it separates atoms from each other
- As the gluon field, it separates protons and neutrons


In Cartesian Physics and the pre-Science era, this was known as extension.  We can call it as a quasi-physical space, as opposed to:
- spacetime which is physical space
- aether which is metaphysical space

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Part 1, Article 51" >}}
<!-- The essence of matter consists in extension -->
[Bodily] substances have extension as their one principal attribute
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics, Part 2, Proposition 2" >}}
Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing
{{< /q >}}


An example of metaphysical space is the space we experience in our dreams and ideas. 

For example, when you think of a pink elephant, you always think of it existing in a space. You never think of the pink elephant fully bloated inside your mind as if it had zero free space.

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/pink.gif" a="Pink Elephant" >}}


- The blank space in the dream space or mental space (which we call Perception Space) is called the macro aetherspace.
- The space that makes up the elephants is called the aetherspace. 

In the Superphysics paradigm, Existence is a dream of the Supreme (or a virtual reality inside an Existence-computer).

Each universe is separated by the macro-aetherspace just as how atoms are separated by the aetherspace since both are made of the same substance.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/dark.jpg" a="Dark Energy" c="The macro-aetherspace, as dark energy, separates universes and spacetime slices just as the aetherspace, as atomic space, separates atoms" >}}


Therefore, each universe is like an atom. 

Dark energy is known to expand or contract. This matches Bob Lazar's assertion that the empty space inside an atom can expand or contract.


{{< q a="Chandogya Upanishad" c="Verse 3.12.7-9" >}} 
That which is Brahman is also the space outside the body. That which is the space outside the body is also the space inside the body. And that which is the space inside the body is also the space within the heart. That treasure within the heart is full and unchanging. He who knows this is always full and not subject to change.
{{< /q >}}


This allows the concept of 7 dimensions each of which has its own property:

Dimension | Property | Example
--- | --- | ---
1 | Point-Perception | Dot
2 | 2D-Perceptions | 2D Curve
3 | Physical Perceptions | 3D Sphere
4 | Past, Present, Future | 4D Geodesic
5 | Alternate or Parallel Realities | 5D Tunnel
6 | Universes in the Multiverse | 6D Shift* 
7 | Totality of Existence | 7D Totality**

{{< n n="*An example is a dream that changes scenes rapidly. **An example is experiencing Everything all at once" >}}



Technically, the 7th Dimension is purely aethereal and no longer part of the Spatial Layer. 


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/aetherspaceall.jpg" alt="Multiverse in the Aetherspace" cap="The aetherspace accounts for alternate realities, other universes, and the totality of existence" >}}

<!-- The aetherspace is the space that holds  -->

## Properties of the Aetherspace

### Spacetime Ratio as Liquidity

The main property of the aetherspace is the space-time ratio. 

- In the lower dimension both time and space are at their minimum -- a point-particle doesn't really care about change. This is opposite of the current fallacy in Physics which weirdly believes that photons experience time as if they were alive. 
- At the highest dimension, both time and space are at their maximum -- cognitive frequency becomes higher that it comes closer to Planck Length, negating the separation created by space and time

In between, they are both malleable:
- In the lower dimensions, time is rigid or limited, but space is malleable or freer
- In the upper dimensions, space is rigid or limited, but time is malleable or freer

This is because the aetherspace is more immaterial and more liquid than spacetime. 

This liquidity gives its wave and probabilistic nature, just as the water in a pool with so many people in it will have many fluctuations or splashes and waves.
- However, the water will never suddenly go to one side of the pool. The nature of doing so belongs to the aethereal layer and not the spatial. 

This has practical uses:
- In Material Superphysics, this leads to baryonic acoustic oscillations, the cosmic web, and teleportation (via timespace).
- In Bio Superphysics, this leads to anti-aging.
- In Social Superphysics, this leads to the faster evolution of societies.

The aetherspace is the blank space within the bubble, while spacetime is the ring where the galaxies reside. Therefore, the aetherspace also facilitates the cosmic web" >}}


## Difference Between the Aetherspace, Timespace, and Spacetime

In the micro or quantum level, the aetherspace separates spacetime slices from each other, as the Planck length.

This means that it can also split universes from each other.

The spacetime slices (that are most similar to each other) are stitched together by timespace.  
- The timespace particles facilitates Planck time. 

Therefore, those slices that are most different from the current one are the 'farthest' away in the aetherspace. 

This really means that they are of a different waveform that the timespace is unable to match in frequency. 

You can think of:
- the aetherspace as the book's body
- the spacetime slices as the pages of the book
- timespace is the browsing or flipping of the pages of the book

The most important use of the aetherspace and macro-aetherspace is teleportation. This is like jumping from page 1 to page 100 in the book without going through 2-99.

<!-- If atoms are our basis, then:
- intra-atomic space is aetherspace
- inter-atomic space is spacetime -->

{{< i s="/graphics/flipbook.gif" a="Flipbook" c="Spacetime slices are like static pages of a book, made dynamic by timespace" >}}


### Macro-Aetherspace as Centers of Vortices or Black Holes

The aetherspace is also the in the center of spatial vortices called black holes by Physics, which we call sos2 of the Substance of Spacetime. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/chakra.jpg" a="vortex" c="Spacetime slices are like static pages of a book, made dynamic by timespace" >}}

<!-- {{< youtube b_FdtRenjgk >}} -->


<!-- Natural and Artificial Vortices

Some areas of spacetime have high concentrations of the aether that allow aetherspace to exist as holes or vortices that can allow matter to tunnel through. 

These are natural portals that, when accesssed by timespace, can allow matter to jump between spacetimes. 

These can be recreated artificially by electro-aetherically enlarging the aetherspace that is already in matter. 

When enlarged as to wrap around matter, it creates a vortex that can let the matter tunnel through to another spacetime.  This is how UFOs travel vast distances, as explained by Bob Lazar and the Essassani. -->
