How do spatial vortices form? 

<!-- Material and Immaterial (Dark Matter) -->

{{< youtube b_FdtRenjgk >}}

Spatial vortices (2nd Element in Cartesian Physics) form when there is an oversupply of aether (5th Element) in 'empty' space.

This increases the ratio of aether (soa) versus space particles (qosts), creating:
- high aether pressure
- low space pressure

This agitates the space particles just outside that high pressure aether area.  

This agitation changes the static space particles into active or flowing space particles (mos3) called 'dark matter' by Physics.

These flowing space particles try to go back to fill the high pressure aether area to fill it up and restore the balance.

In the process, they collide with each other from all angles. 

This is similar to a typhoon forming around a high pressure area in the atmosphere. 

Eventually, the strongest stream, which represents the shape or the configuration of the aether, dominates the other streams. 

This forms a flat plane that rotates due to the opposition of the weaker partcles, similar to the Coriolis force. 

The strongest plane dominates the other planes and dictates the orientation and size of the vortex.

The center of the vortex gets more space particles. 
- This leads to congestion and slower speed. 
- The outer part has less congestion, leading to faster speed. 

In a stellar vortex, as a planet or star, electromagnetic particles (mor) go with the rotating vortex. 
- This pushes the space particles, increasing their speed.
- They become slower the farther they are from the center as the inverse square law.

In a galaxy or star, this creates a boundary on the edge of the territory of the vortex. This edge creates the red shift and halos.  
- A clockwise rotation forms a galaxy
- An anticlockwise rotation forms a quasar
