In Principia Philosophia Part 4 Article 202, Descartes denounces the belief of Democritus that gravity comes from matter, a belief later adopted by Newton. 

Instead, Descartes attributes gravity to the relation or relativity between bodies, facilitated by a virtual substance called the 2nd Element, now called spacetime.

Descartes describes them as globules that are very flexible and mobile, giving them liquid properties.

Instead of globules, we assign to them a teardrop shape. These facilitate space phenomena from gravity to dark energy.

For example, all planets revolve around the sun anticlockwise because the sun rotates anticlockwise. 

Likewise, most planets rotate anticlockwise because there are more space particles outside of an orbital field than within.

An exception is Venus which was hit by another body, causing it to flip. This made its rotation seem to go clockwise just as a clock seems to run in reverse when you view it from behind. 

This makes its rotation go against the natural motion of the solar system, causing it to lose speed. This is why 1 Venus rotation takes 243 Earth-rotations. 

This matches the findings of the Venus Express satellite which showed that Venus was rotating 6.5 minutes slower in 2012 than in 1996.

So we can safely throw away Relativity, dark matter, dark energy, Lambda CDM, and MOND because Cartesian Physics already explains how space phenomena, from torsion balances to microlensing and the expanding universe, are explained by a single principle.

There is even no need for quantized gravity since quantization relies on constants, and constants are only constant within a star or galaxy and not in other stars of galaxies. 

This is why quantum gravity is a waste of time since either it will refuted by dark matter and dark energy, or it could be made to fit theoretically with dark matter and dark energy, but there will be no way to test to it in reality.
