The Spatial Layer is divided into upper, middle, and lower sublayers according to the 3 Influences Model.  

The upper sublayer is quasi-physical, while the lower is physical.

Sublayer | Physicality | Medium | Substance | Quantum 
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Upper | Quasi-physical | Timespace | Time | Galactic Black Holes / Chakras (Dark Matter and Dark Energy)
Mid | Physical | Aetherspace Multiverses | Black Holes |  Stellar and Planetary Black Holes (Orbital Gravity and Surface Tension)
Lower | Physical | Spacetime | Space | Material Things (Atomic Gravity)


The Upper Spatial is not purely physical as it is the realm of:
- mental space and time
- the multiverse
  - This allows acces to different universes, each one with different Physics.

The Middle Spatial is within the Upper Spatial. 
- This is mostly physical where information is deployed onto the current universe.
- This sets the speed of light of the current universe. 

The Lower Spatial is the realm that we can see.
- This leads to matter having length, width, and height that does not change so easily.
- It is also the one that "glues" subatomic particles of the Material Layer together. 

The aethereal layer also has perceptions but are no longer bound by space and time. 

We will first discuss the properties of space and time from the Lower Spatial sublayer, as this is nearest to human perceptions. 


## The Spatial Internal Boundary: The Edge of the Universe

The edge of the universe is the internal boundary in the Spatial layer that separates the visible from the invisible universe.

- The invisible is made up of the parts beyond the edge of the universe, as well as the quantum spaces that are virtual or theoretical. 
- The visible is made up of galaxies and matter that we can see

The ratio 5,130,000 (base 6) or 244,944 (base 10) between the internal boundary at the current edge diameter of 93 billion light years leads to galaxy-particles (vortices in Descartes Physics) sized at around 300,000 light years across. 

Accordingly this is what is found by normal telescopes.

Unlike the lower layers which are based on mass and energy, the upper layers are based on size and scope.

Increasing the detection farther beyond the edge of the universe will lead to the discovery of larger galaxies which then increases the average galaxy size, keeping with the ratio. 

This actually happened with the James Webb Space Telescope which uncovered a lot of huge galaxies which were not supposed to exist

This fact is useful in detecting the properties of the aetherspace which is the Air Element part of the invisible universe that is connected to the aether or 5th Element. 

The aetherspace facilitates levitation and teleportation and is the only means to bypass contact forces and travel to other galaxies (space) and timelines as time travel (time).
