The spatial layer is below the aethereal, as the 'container' of reality.

### Definition and Properties of The Spatial Layer

The Spatial Layer is where perceptions, such as physical reality, take place. 

Unlike the aethereal layer which is only quasi-physical, spacetime is both quasi-physical (via timespace) and physical (via spacetime). 

Each particle in the Spatial Layer is made up of 4 aether particles.

It is purely kinetic energy and has no static forms*. Rather, the relatively static forms of spacetime manifest as the lower layers.
- Parts that have low kinetic energy or aether manifest as empty space or a vacuum
- Parts that have high kinetic energy or aether manifest as vortices. This is similar to a hurricane

Since the Spatial layer is purely kinetic then spatial forces and particles (as media and quanta) are interchangeable.

The Spatial layer leads to spacetime and sets the speed of light, since it is superior to the 3 lower Layers of:
- Electromagnetism or Radiant Layer
- Weak Force or Convertible Layer
- Strong Force or Material Layer

This layer gives the properties of size, space, timespan, etc the universe and everything in it.
