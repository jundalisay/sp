Vortices form when there are energetic space particles caused by an increase in aether in a location.

An easy analogy is a hurricane which is formed from the invisible hot air.

The eye is where the hottest part of the air that gets a spin from the heat (agitation) that then affects the cooler air around it.

This makes the air spin around it. 

The eye only becomes visible when there is so much air clumping and spinning with it. 

But materialists accept only what they can see. 

And so they think that the cause of a hurricane is the visible clouds around eye, and the cause of a galaxy is the visible mass around its vortex.

Newtonian Physics bases its principles on material effects. 

Cartesian Physics bases its principles on aethreal causes. 

It is more solid to create a science based on causes instead of effects.
