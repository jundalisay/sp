The gravitational signature arises from the constant belligerence of the 2 Forces. This creates vortices in the 5 Layers which is called spin by Modern Physics. 

This has the following characteristics:

1. Rotation Direction
2. Rotation Speed
3. Rotation Strength
4. Momentum (within the Spatial Layer)
<!-- 5. Momentum Strength -->

All of these are in relation to other spins. 


## Rotation Direction

The direction of a spin can either by positive (counterclockwise) or negative (clockwise).


## Rotation Speed 

This can be slow or fast


## Rotation Strength

This shows whether an identity will change its rotation speed easily or with difficulty.


## Momentum

The differences of direction, speed, strength leads to:
- relative motion within spacectime 
- instant motion within the aetherspace
