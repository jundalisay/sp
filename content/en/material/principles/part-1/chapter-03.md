The Media of Aether or Moas facilitate the effects of the aethereal layer. These have 3 kinds, based on the sublayers:

Medium | Hindu | Buddhist | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
Existence Space (moa1) | Mahat | Vijnana | Connects to the 5 Strata
Identity Space (moa2) | Aham | Manas | Facilitates the continuous perceptions as qualification (e.g. feelings)
Perception Space (moa3) | Citta | Citta | Facilitates discrete perceptions as quantification 


Unlke the lower layers where forces and particles are easily distinguishable, the media and substances in the aethereal layer is commonly mixed up. It needs more mental diligence to separate them for analysis.  



## Medium of Aether 1: Existence Space

Physical perceptions are made possible by physical existence. Conversely, physical perceptions prove physical existence.

Superphysics allows 2 domains, a metaphysical and a physical.

The Physical Domain is where the Negative Force dominates. This results in the limited expressiveness that we see in non-living things. 

The rocks, planets, stars, and galaxies are all agents of the spatial vortices (black hole) that make up their galaxy or cluster, in the sense that they express for those vortices. 

This is different from living things which express for themselves. This is  explained by Bio Superphysics.

Existence space is the abstract space that includes all physical (non-independent) identities and perceptions, which includes:
- the Identity Space
- the Perception Space

This is analogous to Mahat in Yogic philosophy and Vijnana in Buddhism.

Existence space also links to:
- the lowest Elements of Bio Superphysics
- the lowest Strata of Spiritual Superphysics

Ironically, this is not detectable by sound or any medium that has an analogy in physicality. Instead, it is only detected by the soul through knowledge or the match between the vibration of the soul and the Supreme Entity.
