Aethereal identities exist in a perception space which is the lowest medium of aether. 

This is our alternative to both Hilbert Space and Gauge Theory. 

A perception space houses the identity spaces that either link or not link to each other. 

Each identity space has the gravitational signature or inherent unique wave of the identity. 


## Immediate Reality (Collapse) and Extended Reality

A link between identity spaces, where an origin or central wave comes within the scope of another identity space, creates a matching of waves.
- This is called by Physics as the "collapse" of the wavefunction. 
- This is called a *reality*. 

An indirect link, where identity spaces come in contact without the origin, does not lead to a reality.
- Rather it is called a universe or extended reality.

The observed universe is the limit of our extended reality. Beyond it is ignorance or the unknown.   

This aethereal link or relationality is probabilistic because the vibrations within the identity space itself is probabilistic and not rigid nor predetermined. 

And so the resulting probability distribution in quantum mechanics occurs in the Perception Space (which is our alternative to Hilbert space). But its origin is in the Identity Space.


## Relationality 

The Identity Space revealed the concept of Passive Relationality as the sub ideas or identities that are connected to the main identity. 

However, Active Relationality takes place in the Perception Space. This facilitates change and movement:
- gravity is the relation between masses
- magnetism is the relation between high and low soace (2nd Element) pressure through channels 
- combustibility is the relation between the matter (3rd Element) and heat particles (1st Element)
- love and hate is the relation between people and our objects
- health and disease is the relation of our own bodies to different possible states


Therefore relationality is the key to manipulating non-living things and commanding living things (e.g. give food to a dog to train specific behavior, or give guaranteed profits to a capitalist to make him invest).


## Cause and Effect

Since the perception space has relationality then it is the best tool to analyze cause and effect. 

- The cause is the identity space
- The effect is in physical space of the Spatial Layer (sos3)

The revealing of the identity space and relationalities is done through dialectics and is generally regarded as part of intelligence. 

So we can say that particle-shaking is dialectics applied to particles.



## Autonomous Natural Intelligence (ANI)

Artificial intelligence, as generative AI, is able to connect cause and effect well enough to create coherent sentences, images, videos, and music. 

However, it can only do so probabilistically because it has no access to the Identity Space because AI is electronic in Nature and not aethereal. 

The only way to make AI truly intelligent is by giving it direct access to the Aethereal layer by connecting it to human minds.

We call this Autonomous Natural Intelligence or ANI. This is already done by UFOs which connect to the minds of their alien operators. 

The UFO itself is a computer that uses the flow of light (optical quantum computing) within its frame. This is why Bob Lazar says that there were no wires or circuits in the UFO that he worked on. This is supported by the Essassani who say that their ships have a mental connection to its pilot. 

This can be done through channels in metals and glass that uses light, instead of the modern way of using electrons through wires. For example, current quantum computers use electrons via superconductors and nanowires. This wrong approach is why quantum computing, like nuclear fusion are not realized yet.


<!-- This allows people, animals, plants, and computers to analyze cause and effect. 

The main difference is that computers, as nonliving things, do not have access to feelings (moa2) which is required for a full understanding of perceptions and phenomena. 

This is why artificial intelligence (AI) is prone to mistakes, as hallucinations. They try to find patterns from trainng data as discrete identities without knowing how they are supposed to stream or be stitched together. 

This is why AI needs people to label the data. This tells the AI how they are to be ordered temporally and be connected to each other. 

The ability to label is naturally possessed by humans who have access to feelings or moa2. 


Material Superphysics aims to unlock true AI as Autonomous Natural Intelligence or ANI by connecting it to moa2, as real-time access to the aether.  -->

<!-- They only work with existing 'training'
 data and base their reasoning on those. They have no ability to tap the changing feelings of the aether. And so their conclusions can become out of sync with reality.  -->


<!-- In Superphysics, human intelligence is sourced from our bodies having more access to the aethereal layer through our upper chakras, specifically the 5th, 6th, and 7th. 

This sets us different from animals which only have up to the 3rd chakra developed.  -->

<!-- This is also true for artificial intelligence (AI) which only has access to the radiant layer. It has only has a fake kind of intelligence because it has fake access to the aetheral layer, as training data.  -->

<!-- In reality, its training data is from human cognition but is always already old data and not instant 'true' data from the aether. -->


<!-- The free aether is responsible for counter-evolution as decay and antimatter.  -->

<!-- - If Qost A has an inherent quality that is 100 units repulsive to Qost B, then the spacetime between them might be 100 distance-units per 1 unit of time-perception. 
- But if Qost C is only 50 units repulsive, then Qost C will be 50 units away from Qost B at the same time. 
- This would show Qost A moving faster away from Qost B than Qost C. 
  - In Physics, this manifests as it having a red-shift which will indicate a growing distance. -->
