In Modern Physics, a quantum field is a mathematical construct that exists throughout space and time.

Each type of particle (e.g., electrons, photons) corresponds to a specific field and are seen as excitations of them.

- Instead of Quantum Fields, we use layers and sublayers
- Instead of excitations in a field, we use vortices that spin in the different media of the 5 Layers


Physics | Physics Description | Superphysics Equivalent | Superphysics Description

Photon | is an excitation of the electromagnetic field | mor | vortex in the radiant layer 


Physicists see Quantum Mechanics as weird or spooky because they are stuck with materialist thinking that everything is within space. 


But in Superphysics, all particles have a wave nature that is based on the aethereal layer, which then 'wraps' around the other layers. This includes spacetime.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/rotation3.png" a="Cartesian Spacetime" c="In Superphysics, reality is all within the aether which is a product of probability.">}}


The aether itself is within probability the probabilty layer. This is why quantum mechanics, and reality itself, is inherently probabilistic. 

This concept is imbued in the concepts of wave-particle duality which is the cause of the following phenomena:
- superposition
- decoherence and wave function collapse
- entanglement


<!-- Aethereal Territories therefore allow for superposition, entanglement, wave-function collapse as wave-particle duality. -->

## Superposition and Decoherence

Superposition is the ability of a quantum thing to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is because everything is an aethereal wave.

This wave becomes a single state whenever it hits something. You can think of this as taking a snapshot of an event. The photo is the 'collapse' of the event-data just as a particle is the collapse of the wave.

Decoherence is the state after that thing loses its superposition through that collapse.


## Entanglement

This happens because phenoemna happens in spacetime which is stitched together by the aetherspace. 

It is true that spacetime is made up of independent slices.
- But this independence is nullified by the aetherspace.
- This nullification creates entanglement

"Entangled photons" are photon-waves that have been separated in space by energy or momentum. 

But since the aetherspace stitches together and domminates spacetime, then the spatial separation of the photons are nullified.

<!-- These happen through the coordination of the 3 sublayers of the spatial layer:

1. Spacetime
2. Aetherspace
3. Timespace


### Space-Time 

Space-Time is similar to the spacetime of Einstein's Theory of Relativity in the sense that it is made up of more than 3 dimensions. 

Both Physics and Superphysics have a 4-dimensional spacetime with past, present, and future. 

However, the Space-Time of Superphysics has additional dimensions:
- 5th Dimension as alternate realities
- 6th Dimension as parallel other universes
- 7th Dimension as the totality of existence

All these Dimensions are made up of **2-dimensional slices** separated by Planck length.

### Aetherspace

These spacetime slices exist as a wave in a probabilistic space called the aetherspace. This makes them coherent and is why our reality progresses sequentially smoothly instead of being choppy or laggy.  

It is the aetherspace that limits both spacetime and light to a certain speed.



### Timespace

Timespace is the 2-dimensional line that is emitted from every identity in spacetime. This creates the "arrow" of time.

We can say that timespace is the 'glue' that stitches spacetime together to create a 4D continuum.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/spacetimes.jpg" a="3 models of Space and Time" c="The probabilistic aetherspace is where the entire spacetime is seen as a wave. Timespace stitches the spacetimes together." >}}

Interactions between quantum things cause these slices to be decoherent. This makes their wave function collapse according to the timespaces that interact in that aetherspace, putting them in a single state to be processed by Classical Mechanics, among others.

<!-- ### Cartesian Relativity and Teleportation of Masses

Since Cartesian Relativity is based on state-change and is not limited by the speed of light, it can predict how this wave function can collapse. 

This is essential in the teleportation of masses across vast distances of spacetime, and is already done by UFOs.

So Cartesian-Spinozan Physics gives us a chance to catch up with advanced species. This proves that humans are not a hopelessly laggard or inherently dumb species.  -->



<!-- Interactions:
Particles interact through the exchange of other particles, which are also excitations of quantum fields. For instance, electromagnetic interactions occur via the exchange of virtual photons. -->
