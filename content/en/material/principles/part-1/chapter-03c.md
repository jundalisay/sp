The clash of the 2 Forces leads to:
- the 2 domains
- the 5 layers 
- the 3 gunas or sublayers within those layers


## The 8 Densities

The gravitational signature within the identity space has differences from other signatures. These differences can be grouped into 7 as the 7 densities, with the 8th density being the totality. 

Domain | Density | Name | Examples
--- | --- | --- | ---
Physical | 1 | Identity | quarks, photons, point-particles
Physical | 2 | Self | rocks, asteroids
Physical | 3 | Collective | plants, animals
Quasi-Physical | 4 | Lower Mind | humans, intelligent beings
Metaphysical | 5 | Higher Mind | advanced beings
Metaphysical | 6 | Soul | spiritual beings
Metaphysical |  7 | Brahma or Oversoul | The Supreme
Void |  8 | Pre-Existential | The Absolute


These densities are the range that the Supreme can assume. Therefore, all identities in Existence must have a density, which is really their inherent aethereal frequency. 

Material Superhysics extends only up to the 4th density as the universe itself being a lower mind or physical aspect of the Supreme.

Bio Superhysics begins from the lower mind which has independent expression. 





## The 8 Dimensions

Identities with similar densities interact with each other through their relational links. 

These links create an abstract strucuture that we call dimensions of reality.

Since the links are dependent on density, as the vibration of the identity, then dimensions depend on density. 

The subtler the density, the more dimensions are possible since the links can connect to the crude and to the subtle and everything in between.

A crude density on the other hand has a very limited set of connections, leading to fewer dimensions.

<!-- Dimensions are the relations of these densities with each other.  -->

Dimension | Name | Manifestation
--- | --- | ---
1 | Existential | Identity
2 | Planar | 2-dimensional space
3 | Spatial | 3-dimensional space
4 | Temporal | Time
5 | Lateral | Alternate Realities
6 | Multiversal | Universes in the Multiverse
7 | Causal | Ultimate Cause
8 | Void | Void


For example, a rock is 2nd density and so it can experience the 3rd dimension.

Living things are 3rd density and so can experience time as the 4th dimension. 

Humans are 4th density and so can experience 5th dimension as alternate realities, validated through deja vu, clairvoyance, clairsentience, bilocation, telekinesis, etc. 

Advanced beings, such as the Essassani, are 5th density and so can experience different universes including non physical ones.
