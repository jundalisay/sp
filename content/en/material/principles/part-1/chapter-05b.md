The chapter on Identity Space explained how the Negative Force cuts up waves into individual discrete identities.

In Modern Physics, this is known as quantization.

- In the aethereal layer, this leads to gravitational signatures
- In the spatial layer, this leads to spacetime slices
- In the radiant layer, this leads to quantized energy levels and states
- In the convertible layer, this leads to beta decay particles


## The Quantization of Substances

 <!-- As the Crudification Through the Lower Layers -->

The 20th century believed that electromagnetism was a wave. 
- Light was accepted as waves through Huygens
- Heat was accepted as waves through Fourier
- Electromagnetism was accepted as waves through Maxwell


This was changed when Max Planck revealed that blackbody radiation did not totally match the dynamics of waves.

Instead, it had a property called quanta which split it up, making it discrete. This made its energy-carrying capacity finite. 

This matches the separation or splitting done by the Negative Force on physical phenomena. 

The quantization of:
- the material layer leads to micro-aetherspace (quarks)
- the convertible layer leads to neutrinos
- the radiant layer leads to electrons
- the spatial layer leads to black holes
- the aethereal layer leads to monads


### Shapes to Aid in Visualization of Media, Substances and Quanta

To easily understand dynamics of Media, Substances and Quanta, without the need to use the Identity Space, we use particle shapes.

This is because dynamic waves are hard to visualize. 

We got this from Descartes who got the idea from Plato who created the Platonic shapes in Timeaus.

In the Asian sciences, the shapes are called mandalas and yantras. 

<!-- The major tones form general shapes when they are visualized in the same way that audio is visualized by modern mp3 players. This is why Plato organized them into 5 shapes. However, we differ a bit because we base our shape in the aether content: -->

Layer | Aether content | Greek Shape | Superphysics Shape
--- | --- | --- | ---
5 Aethereal | 5 units | Dodecahedron  | Pentagon
4 Spatial |  4 | Octahedron | Square
3 Radiant | 3 | Tetrahedron | Line or Triangle
2 Convertible | 2 | Icosahedron | Dash 
1 Material | 1 | Cube | Sphere

### Musical Notes and Programming Languages

Note that these shapes are NOT how those forces and particles visually appear in actuality. 

These are just **representations** that help the human mind understand the dynamics of those forces and particles which are actually in a compound wave format. 

This is similar to musical notes representing the actual sound waves of a song.
- No one looks for circular note shapes in waveforms
- Instead, the timing and tone of the written note should match the timing and tone of the waveform.

This is also similar to programming languages being in English even if computers talk in binary and machine language. 
- No one looks for `for` and `if` in bytecode or machine code. 
- Instead, the results that come from machine code should match the instructions written in programming language. 

For example, the Javacript snippet `declare global {namespace App}` uses English words. But these look totally different from how they appear to the computer's processor after conversion to usable code.

Similarly, the real look of an electron and photon is totally different from the shapes we list. But the dynamics are the same. 

  <!-- even if its output is ultimately code that software can understand, but humans cannot.   -->

These shapes are helpful in understanding why the fundamental forces act in the way that they do. 

For example:
- the large size of photons relative to electrons explain how photons can push away electrons through the photoelectric effect. 
- the reverse spin of quasars explain how they can emit jets of energy

This will be fully explained in Chapter 5.
