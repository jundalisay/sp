The Transformative Monad changes the aether into different particles within the same layer.

For example:
- virtual photons transform to light via electron spin in LEDs
- chemicals change to other chemicals
- solid ice changes into vapor gas

As such, this is the most common type of monad. 

<!-- This change is done through aethereal effort, as spin or state, which leads to relational action, leading to a new spin or state-change. 
- Spin is based on internal configuration or gravitational signature
- Spin happens when there is a match between the external media and the internal configuration, leading to energy to flow into the identity.  -->


The movement between identities happens through their relational differences, as Cartesian Relationality.
- Some relations are attractive
- Others are repulsive

These relational differences are from the difference in the internal configuration of an identity. This configuration is set by a thing's monad and manifests as the gravitational signature. 

An analogy is:
- a quantum of identity as a washer
- a medium is a screw

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/config.png" a="Identities with holes" >}}

The energetic screw fits into the washer transferring the energy to it. This allows the identity to act, as spin. 

This means that all energies come from space which flow into each particle. 

More energy can be obtained by matching the internal configuration with the desired energy or force external. 

For example, electricity is able to get energy from space around the wire through the presence of electrons which act as a channel for the virtual photons in space. 

So the sequence is:

1. Identity settles on a configuration, as state-change
2. This configuration allows energy to go through the identity
3. The energy causes the identity to spin or act based on its nature or layer and sublayer

We call this process as "Effort".

This is the meaning of our equation for everything, which we call the Eagle:

### Effort Leads to Action

In Physics, the concept of Action is most similar to Effort, which is different from Energy and Force.
- Energy is the medium before it enters the identity
- Force is the effect of the effort on the identity

So the sequence is:

1. The Identity Changes its state or configuration
2. Energy Flows through the Identity
3. Action Happens through the Identity
4. Force Results (if there is another object to move or be moved, or act on or be acted on)

Effort is steps 1 and 2.


### How Physics Came Up With Action

The concept of action was realized by Descartes from the phenomena of colors. 

Colors are created whenever:
- light bounces off an object
- colored light is emitted from an object

For example, a dark room will have all its objects as black. But when you turn on a light bulb:
- the aetherspace in the atoms of the filament causes light to have a yellow or white color depending on the spin of the electrons
- the light bouncing off from the objects causes the photons to spin differently, revealing different colors. 

{{< i s="/photos/buy.jpg" a="Store" c="The light bounces off of objects, revealing their color" >}}


In this example:
- the spin of the electron in the light bulb determines the color of the light
- the spin of the reflected photons determines the color of the object.

Here, the spin dictates colors which is an effort or action of the photon. Light has other efforts or actions:
- information-carrier as pulses
- force-carrier as brightness
- spread as invariance

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/action.jpg" a="Action" >}}


Maupertuis denoted this action as `S = mvs`. 

The path that the light will take is then determined as the one that takes the least time. This creates the Principle of Least Action. 

Euler then converts this into integrals, while Lagrange adds multipliers. This creates Lagrangian mechanics.

Unlike `F = ma` which uses external forces to explain motion, Euler-Lagrange uses internal action or effort.

Descartes calls this **true motion** which is sourced from the relation of an object's action (based on its spin) to the actions of other objects (and their spin). This relation is what we see as force.

- Planck used the energy of light (which is one action) to create Planck's constant. 
- Einstein used the the invariance of light (another action) to create Relativity.
- Feynman used probability of path integrals (which is actually the action of the aether instead of light) to create quantum mechanics.

Feynman wrongly used relativistic time (which is an action of light instead of the aether) in path integrals. This created infinities which people tried to solve with Supersymmetry and String Theory. 

Descartes already solved this by adding the aether and its actions.

But this was unsolved by Einstein who only knew light actions and so he made time an action of light instead of the aether through his scam simultaneity of time. This has set back Physics by over 100 years.


## The Principle of Least Action

Gravitational Signatures lead to ineherent state change which manifests as action.

Since the universe is totally completely filled with particles and since all particles must be unique and occupy a space by itself, then it follows that **individual actions are very limited**.

This is why identities move according to the least action according to its signature. 

> Individual actions are very limited

Interestingly, we discovered this independently through our moneyless system wherein everyone in the moneyless economy focus on a unique skill that they excel in.

Their unique signature allows them to create high quality goods and services at the least cost. 

This principle makes its way into Physics as the principle of least action wherein particles choose the path that has the least energy expense.

This does not mean that the particle is lazy. Rather, it means that it respects the signatures of other particles.

This limitation of action is done by the crudifying monad, the same monad that causes quantization. 

This limitation is surpassed by the transformative monad by pooling together as energy in order to create action that gradually overcomes the limitation, leading to more (and stronger) forces.
