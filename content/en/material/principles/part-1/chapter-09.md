Gravitational signatures interact in 2 ways:

1. With itself over time

We notate this as:

```
identity1_state1 : identity1_state2 : identity1_state3 : ...
```


2. With others at the same time

We notate this as:

```
identity1_state1 : .. : identity2_state1
```


This creates an infinite chain of connected states either temporally with itself, or spatially with others. Our notation is able to notate how everything is interconnected.

{{< n n="Recall that state-change is an effect of the monads as either subtlifying, transformative, crudifying." >}}

The Conservation laws, here as the Law of Conservation of Idea, then produces movement and change from the interaction of those diverse monads. These then cascade down to the physical domain through the 4 lower layers.  

This means that all motion is internal, arising from the uniqueness of each gravitational signature. This creates a ratio with other identities that an identity comes in contact with. 



Instead of using equations such as Force = Mass * Acceleration, a starting ratio for a mass is:

```
Mass_State1 : Location 1
```

To move it to location 2:

```
(Material Contact Force + Mass_State1) : Location 2
```

Here, matter-ial forces can be added to matter to change their location in space because both are of the Earth-Element (Strong Force). 

In effect, the addition of the Material force on Mass_State1 caused it to change state, so that:

```
Mass_State2 : Location 2
```

But this is not true for Electromagnetic Forces (Fire Element). For example, the following does not work:

```
(Heat + Mass) : Location 2
```

Instead, to move the mass to location 2 Physics uses `(F = Q(vB))`:

```
Magnetic Force + (charged object (magnetic speed : field)) : Location 2
```

Note how this has more factors than matter-induced movement. Those factors have to be manipulated in a more precise way to change the state of the mass or object. 

Therefore, to move the mass with Aethereal Force (5th Element):

```
Aethereal Effort + (mass (...) : (charged object (..)) : Location 2
```

Where `...` represents the factors that we are still trying to discover.

This is the foundation of anti-gravity as done by the ancient Egyptians.



<!-- Kepler's system was very complicated, because being German like Hegel and Kant, he over-explained it as to be totally confusing.

Newton solved it with a dumbed-down system of F = ma. It removes the factors and makes it understandable to all. 

But by doing so, it also removed the possibility of magenetic and aethereal movement.

We aim to simplify Kepler's system to make it understandable while retaining its potential for aethereal movement, as well as more improved magnetic ones. -->



<!-- ## The Flaw of External Motion

Newton described motion coming from an external force as a single movement. Einstein revised this by making it relative to frames of reference, as well as dividing it into smaller parts as tensors (as measuring rod `S`).  

{{< img src="/graphics/movement.png" alt="Movement according to Einstein" cap="Superphysics uses internal movement to change location in spacetime" >}}

But where do all the external forces come from? 

Newton and Einstein source it from matter: The more matter, the more the gravitational force. This matter then came from a material Singularity that exploded as a Big Bang. 

But where did this Singularity come from?

## Internal Motion

To solve this mystery, we throw out sophistical opinion of Einstein, Newton, and Aristotle that movement is sourced externally whether from concentric spheres or a fabric-like spacetime. 

Instead, all movement is sourced internally, from the state-change of the object through its [gravitational signature](/material/principles/intro/chapter-02). For example, a man moves from the bed to the kitchen because his internal state changed. His mind switched from a `wanting-to-sleep-signature` to a `wanting-to-eat-signature`.  

A more technical example is how an app changes from one screen to another, such as a red screen changing into a blue one. This done by changing its `color-state-variable` from <code style="color: red">red</code> into <code style="color: blue">blue</code>. It gives an illusion of moving from a red screen onto a blue one when in fact the same screen is just redrawn to reflect the change in state. 

**This means that the universe re-drew itself while the man was traveling from the bed to the kitchen.** This then matches the probabilistic nature of particle spin.  -->
