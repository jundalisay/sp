Physical Identity is the main substance of Existence that within physical existence. 

Existence with capital E is made up of:
- metaphysical existence
  - This is the focus of Material Superphysics 
- physical existence
  - This is the focus of Bio, Social, and Spiritual Superphysics 


Normally, physical identity is discerned when it exists separate from another identity in space but not in time.

However, the aethereal layer is above the spatial layer which becomes irrelevant. So how do we define identities if space doesn't exist to spatially separate identities?


## Differences in monads as wave differences are used to separate identities

Since space and time is irrelevant, we used the differences in wave quality.

For example, in an orchestral music, we hear different instruments all at the same time and space (as the sound):
- violin
- cello 
- double bass
- piccolo
- flute
- trumpet
- trombone
- cymbals
- bass drum
- snare drum

We identify them separately based on the differences of the soundwaves that they produce.

This is done by our aethereal Cartesian Plane.
