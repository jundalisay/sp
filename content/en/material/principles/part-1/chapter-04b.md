The previous chapter explained how the Negative Force cuts up waves into individual discrete identities.

In Modern Physics, this is known as quantization.

- In the aethereal layer, this leads to gravitational signatures
- In the spatial layer, this leads to spacetime slices
- In the radiant layer, this leads to quantized energy levels and states
- In the convertible layer, this leads to beta decay particles


## The Quantization of Energy As the Crudification Through the Lower Layers

Quantization was developed by Max Planck in order to correctly describe the spectrum of a light-emitting body as a response to the "ultraviolet catastrophe".

This catastrophe was caused by the difference between the predicted infinite light given out by a light-emitting body, contrasted with its actual emission which is not infinite.

Max Planck solved the problem by saying that energy comes out at discrete quanta.

This led to quantum mechanics.

Material Superphysics explains that this quantization happens in the four layers. It is only exposed in the Radiant Layer (Electromagnetism) because that layer is the carrier of information (as one of the actions of the 1st Element in Cartesian Physics).


### Quantum Shapes to Aid in Visualization

We use this informational--ability of visibility be creating particle shapes for each substance, medium, and quantum in our 5 Layer Model.

This is because dynamic waves are hard to visualize. This technique was used by Descartes who got the idea from Plato who created the Platonic shapes in Timeaus.

In the Asian sciences, the shapes are called mandalas and yantras. 

The major tones form general shapes when they are visualized in the same way that audio is visualized by modern mp3 players. This is why Plato organized them into 5 shapes. However, we differ a bit because we base our shape in the aether content:

Layer | Aether content | Greek Shape | Superphysics Shape
--- | --- | --- | ---
5 Aethereal | 5 units | Dodecahedron  | Pentagon
4 Spatial |  4 | Octahedron | Square
3 Radiant | 3 | Tetrahedron | Line or Triangle
2 Convertible | 2 | Icosahedron | Dash 
1 Material | 1 | Cube | Sphere

Note that these shapes are NOT how those forces and particles exist in actuality. These are just representations that help the human mind understand the dynamics of those forces and particles which are actually in a compound wave format. 

This is similar to musical notes representing the actual sound waves of a song. 

This is also similar to programming languages being in English even if computers talk in binary and machine language. For example, the Javacript snippet `declare global {namespace App}` uses English words even if its output is ultimately code that software can understand, but humans cannot.  


These shapes are helpful in understanding why the fundamental forces act in the way that they do. 

For example, the 2D nature of photons allow them to go through the 2D spacetime unhindered. They are only hindered by the aetherspace which is 3D and limits them to 300,000 kilometers per second. 

This will be fully explained in Chapter 5.
