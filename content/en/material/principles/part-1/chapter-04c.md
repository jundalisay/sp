### The Creation of Matter

Matter is created inside a steller vortex and is spread to the galaxy through dissociation which is either instant or gradual.


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology" >}}
Structural Dissociation happens when celestial bodies lose vital energy. This can be instantaneous or gradual.
{{< /q >}}


1. Instant

This happens when the Negative Force keeps on imposing itself on a lifeless, matter-filled, heavenly body. This results in a supernova.

A living heavenly body is one whose core is not yet filled with matter, but rather has the convertible, radiant, spatial, and aethereal layers still active.   


2. Gradual 

This happens when the Negative Force slowly creeps into a living celestial body through its spaces or qosts. This manifests as a nebula.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 3, Article 116" >}}
The star will easily be removed by a neighboring star as soon as it becomes covered with several spots. All the air-aether near the star will be added to the other star and will follow its motion. The remaining air-aether will migrate to other neighboring vortices.

Both instantaneous and gradual dissociation converts the celestial body back into the component 5 layers.
- Instant dissociation converts matter back to light
- Gradual dissociation converts light into spacetie




### The Creation of Planets

In Cartesian Physics, planets are stellar vortices that failed to become stars. 

A stellar system being born has many vortices around a central vortex. The weaker ones get absorbed into the stronger ones. This leads to the following known outcomes:

- 2 strong vortices as binary stars, and weaker vortices as planets. This is the most common.
- 1 strong vortex as a star, and many weaker vortices.
- 1 strong vortex alone. This is rare and is seen in Vega.

The dynamics of planets such as plate tectonics will be discussed in the Material Layer.



### The Creation of Life

The dissociation of stellar vortices spreads both organic and inorganic matter within a galaxy. 

Organic matter then becomes the vehicle for life when combined with the Positive Force emitted by a star. This is evidenced on earth by the patterns of the spread of certain viruses that follow the patterns of starlight.

The evolution of life will be discussed by Bio Superphysics.

<!-- - Phase 3: The electromagnetic layer turns the clumped energy into electrons or "quantum of electricity" (qoe) and photons "quantum of light" (qol) 
- Phase 4: The weak force of the Convertible layer turn the electrons into neutrons "quantum of radioactivity" (qor)
- Phase 5: The strong force turn neutrons into protons as quarks (quantum of matter or qom) via gluons --> 

<!-- These lead to the first shining stars. The protons in them then make up the basic elements which are then spread throughout space through the explosion of the qost, as a supernova. The exploded matter and unconverted energy are then re-clumped in the same qost to repeat the process until all the energy is converted into matter.  -->
