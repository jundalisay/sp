The previous part explained waves as a flow. Here we represent waves as an identity, as a shaped particle.

Identities are created as an effect of the Negative Force splitting up waves into discrete quanta.

This is to facilitate a clearer perception of that identity or part of Nature as separate and unique from other parts. 

This means that the uniqueness of everything in the universe is caused by Negativity. 


## Gravitational Signatures

This uniquness of each identity is embodied in its gravitational signatures, which are inherently negative. 

Uniqueness creates differences which usually become belligerent or fricitional against each other, unless the Positive Force dominates.

With the Positive Force, the uniqueness is harmonized with those of others. This then leads to diversity. 

For example, without harmonization, hydrogen stays alone. But thanks to harmonization, there can exist various compounds such as:
- Water (H2O)
- Hydrochloric acid (HCl)
- Methane (CH4)



## Monads make up an Aether particle and the Gravitational Signature

Gravitational signatures are made up of monads just like a QR code is made up of black ink on paper or pixels on the screen.

![QR Code](/icons/qr.png)

- If the black ink is the monad as moa3, then its paper is physical existence or moa1
- If the pixels are the monad, then its background is physical existence


Since monads are subjective and not objective, they are explained by Superphysics, not by Material Superphysics.

The only concept that we need to know is that a monad makes up an aether particle. It is the aether that makes up all other particles. 


Layer | Aether Content
--- | --- |
Aethereal | 5
Spatial | 4
Radiant | 3
Convertible | 2
Material | 1

This is why we call the Aether as the 5th Element or Layer, and Matter as the 1st. 
- The waves more obviously take on a particle-shape and behavior from the Radiant Layer to the Material.
- The waves stay as waves in the Aethereal and Spatial Layers.


### The Gravitational Signatures or Dharma as the center of the Sublayers 

Each particle represents a wave. Each wave moves up and down, as amplitude, from its zero level.

We call this zero or average level as the **central signature or dharma** for that wave.

This means that a wave has 3 kinds depending on its relation to that central signature. It can be:
- above that level
- within that level
- below that level

These lead to 3 subelements or sublayers for each Element or Layer.
