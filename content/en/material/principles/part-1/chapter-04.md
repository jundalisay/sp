The substance of the aether is identity which is within existence. Identities put together creates relations between identities. This leads to the 3 sublayers of the substance of the aether:


Name | Quality
--- | ---
Physical Existence `soa1` | This is the idea of nonliving physical existence (as opposed to living existence of Bio and Social Superphysics)
Identity `soa2` | This leads to particle shapes
Relation `soa3` | This leads to action and forces

<!-- Everything that we perceive, from the lower mind, or conceive, from the higher mind, is an aethereal object which can be either be dynamic or static. 
- If it is dynamic then it is a medium. Dynamism comes from the relations of identities.
- If it is static then it is idea or content. Staticity comes from identity, as separation by the Negative Force
 -->

In a nutshell:
- The idea of Existence is the unity of all ideas
- The idea of Identity is the individualization of ideas
  - This individualization or separation is caused by the Negative Force just as the merging is from the Positive Force
  - We can say that making an effort to organize all ideas into a system or science is from the Positive Force just as ignorance of unity or organization is from the Negative 
- Relations are the connections between ideas


The Existence is theoretical as Pre-Existence. 

It becomes actual existence as SOA3 or reality.


## The Multiverse as Nonliving Physical Existence (soa1)

The idea of the totality of Physical Existence is highest part of the 5 Layers model.
- Therefore, it is the end of Material Superphysics and the start of Spiritual Superhysics (since we associate the paranormal with spirits).
- This links laterally with the 5 Strata of the living domain of Bio Superphysics. 

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/layerstrata.jpg" a="" >}}

The connection of this sublayer to the metaphysical domain allows it the possibility of different ideas of universes, leading to the concept of the multiverse.  Rather, the multiverse is the material part of the Supreme Entity or Brahma or the Totality of Existence (which includes the immaterial parts).

**So the mechanism for shifting into different universes lies in the upper aethereal sublayer.**

This will allow a mind-identity (jiva) in one universe to shift or transfer into a different universe by using the strata in the Metaphysical Domain as a birdge. 

This can be done by ships that have artificial intelligence that can tap into the subtlifying quantum (qoa1). 


## Physical Existence is the Totality of all Physical Waves

All the Media and Substances of the 5 Layers are actually waves of differnt qualities. These are all merged in soa1.

- Flowing waves are from the Positive Force which always expands, unifies (connects), and goes out of itself to learn and know
- Particles are waves that are cut or are interfered with by the Negative Force which always separates and breaks apart what the Positive puts together

The eternal belligerence of the Positive and Negative creates the 4 properties of waves:


n | Property | Force 
--- | --- | ---
1 | Continuity | Positive
2 | Density | Negative
3 | Limit  | Negative
4 | Forward Movement or Spread (Radiance) | Positive


This manifests in:

Science | Name
--- | ---
Material Superhysics | 4 Laws of Thermodynamics
Bio Superphysics | 4 Stages of life
Supersociology | 4 Social Cycles
Supereconomics | 4 Laws of Value
Spiritual Superphysics | 4 Paths (bhakta, karma, jnana, raja)


<!-- Chapter 2 explained that the aether was split into two parts:

1. Crude 

This is made up of moa3 as the effect of the Negative Force

2. Subtle

This is made up of moa1 and moa2 as the effect of the Positive


Since the aether has a wave-nature, this division gives 2 properties to waves:

1. Waves as crude identities

As identities, we call it particles.

2. Waves as subtle flows

As a flow, we call it energy. 

However, to keep the proper demarcation between the physical and metaphysical domains, we call energy in the aethereal layer as "effort".  

{{< i s="/graphics/super/egl.jpg" a="Effort" c="We call aethereal energy as Effort" >}} -->

<!--  which can manifest as:
- heat
- light
- sound
- feelings, etc.  -->


<!-- Energy has 4 Laws based on its flow. This now manifests as the 4 Laws of Thermodynamics. Supersociology and Supereconomics use the same principle: -->

<!-- to plot the cycles of society -->

<!-- Thermodynamics Law | Supersociology/economics Law | Meaning
--- | --- | ---
3rd Law | 1st Law | The wave has a base
1st Law | 2nd Law | The wave maintains its wave-ness instead of fizzling out. This leads to our perceptions (and matter) persisting instead of vanishing instantly
0th Law | 3rd Law (zero energy) | The wave having regular wavelengths instead of random ones. This is consistent with the previous law
2nd Law (entropy) | 4th Law | The wave going forward. This creates the concept of linear time or perceptions coming at a sequence -->


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/waveflow.jpg" a="Flow" >}}


<!-- Property | Thermodynamics | Supersociology | Supereconomics 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Continuity or Balance | 0th law | Thinker | 3rd Law 
Conservation | 1st law | Warrior | 2nd Law
Spread | 2nd law  | Traders | 4th Law
Measure or Range | 3rd law  | Worker | 1st Law -->



{{< youtube eEGJY4F6QKw >}}


<!-- - The 2nd and 1st law of thermodynamics refer to the external aspects of the wave
- The 3rd and 0th laws refer to the internal aspects

In Superphysics, the internals are the cause of the externals and so the internals are more important.

In Social Superphysics, this is why the Intellectual (Thinking) and Working classes are more important than the Business (Trading) and Warrior Classes.


### Waves as Sound The Octave vs the Pentatonic Scale

The ancients classified these waves into 5 depending on their shapes (which represent their frequency) which will be discussed in full in the next chapter.

Each of the 5 layers has a sound which represents the wave of that layer. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/doremi.jpg" alt="Universal sounds" >}}

This gives us frequencies:

Element | Layer | Note | Frequency
--- | --- | --- | ---
Aether | Aether | Ti | ?
Air | Spacetime | La | ? 
Fire | Radiant | Sol | ?
Water | Convertible | Fa | ?
Earth | Material | Do | 130.81


The question-marks above will test whether the following notes to impact the corresponding layer. We only could do tests on material objects and so we can set 130 Hz as the base for the rest. 

The totality of the universe, combining the physical and metaphysical, have 8 tones as the octave of the Greeks and the Bagua of the Chinese.


These tones manifest as waves such as pulse. 

By checking a patient's pulse, the traditional Chinese doctor checks the wave of that person through his own feelings. Likewise, the homeopath checks this wave through the electrical current that he runs through his patient.  -->

<!-- The Greeks on the other hand, used eight sounds to represent the five layers. Three, do-re-mi (C-D-E), are for the lower three layers, while fa-so-la-ti-do (F-G-A-B) are for the spatial and aethereal layers. C and G were common in Western Classical Music.   -->

<!-- This sound or wave system is the only way to judge and measure the aethereal layer, as well as give the complete picture of the spatial layer. This is because light and sight are useless in the invisible aethereal layer and not 100% useful in the spatial layer.

For example, Galileo demonstrated that two objects with different weights *visually* fall to the ground at the same time, at the same speed. However, those two objects *make different sounds*. The difference of their resulting sounds then will indicate the differences in the nature of their gravitational signature. 

Layer | Transition
--- | ---
Aethereal | Idea into Aethereal Wave
Spacetime | Aethereal Wave into Physical Wave
Radiant (Electromagnetic) | Physical Wave into Emitted Particles
Convertible | Emitted Particles into Matter
Material | Matter into Identity


The gravitational signatures can then be manipulated through particle dialectics in order to create actions. -->


<!-- In Physics, this identity is known as 'unit'. 

A quantum is the smallest unit. 

And so the aether is really a quantum, leading to Quantum Physics. 

The 3 types of Physics fits into our 5 Layer Model:

Layer | Physics
--- | ---
Aether | Quantum Physics 
Radiant | Einstein Physics
Material | Classical Physics

However, we use the term aether in order to separate our system from the assumptions in Quantum Physics.
