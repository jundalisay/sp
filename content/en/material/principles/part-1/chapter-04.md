The substance of the aether is identity. This has 3 versions:


Name | Quality
--- | ---
Physical Existence | This is the idea of nonliving physical existence (as opposed to living existence of Bio and Social Superphysics)
Identity | This leads to particle shapes
Relation | This leads to action and forces

Everything that we perceive, from the lower mind, or conceive, from the higher mind, is an aethereal object which can be either be dynamic or static. 
- If it is dynamic then it is a medium. Dynamism comes from the relations of identities.
- If it is static then it is idea or content. Staticity comes from identity, as separation by the Negative Force


## The Multiverse as Nonliving Physical Existence soa3 

The idea of the totality of Physical Existence is the upper limit of 5 Layers model and therefore the end of Material Superphysics and the start of Spiritual Superhysics (since we associate the paranormal with spirits). 

This links laterally with the 5 Strata of the living domain of Bio Superphysics.

The connection of this sublayer to the metaphysical domain allows it the possibility of different ideas of universes, leading to the concept of the multiverse.  Rather the multiverse is the material part of the Supreme Entity or Brahma or the Totality of Existence (which includes the immaterial parts).

So the mechanism for shifting into different universes lies in the upper aethereal layer. 

This will allow a mind-identity (jiva) in one universe to shift or transfer into a different universe by using the strata in the Metaphysical Domain as a birdge. 

This can be done by ships that have artificial intelligence that can tap into the subtlifying quantum (qoa1). 


<!-- In Physics, this identity is known as 'unit'. 

A quantum is the smallest unit. 

And so the aether is really a quantum, leading to Quantum Physics. 

The 3 types of Physics fits into our 5 Layer Model:

Layer | Physics
--- | ---
Aether | Quantum Physics 
Radiant | Einstein Physics
Material | Classical Physics

However, we use the term aether in order to separate our system from the assumptions in Quantum Physics.
