The Quantum of aether (qoa) is the monad. It is the smallest unit of an aethereal substance which takes the form of the universe.

The best explanation for a qoa is the Prime Radiant of the alien race called the Essassani. However, many people are allergic to the idea of aliens, so we use humans sources as:
- Leibniz
- Pythagoras
- Kepler 


According to Pythagoras and Kepler, motion is sourced from an invisible, immaterial "monad".


{{< q a="Diogenes" >}}
According to Pythagoras, the monad was the beginning of everything. From the monad proceeds an indefinite duad, which is subordinate to the monad. From the monad and the indefinite duad proceed numbers. From numbers proceed signs. From signs come lines which make up plane shapes. From plane shapes come solid bodies. From solid bodies come sensible bodies. These have 4 elements: fire, water, earth, and air.

monad | monad
duad | 2 domains (dualistic existence)
numbers | identity
signs | timespace
lines and shapes | aetherspace (Cartesian extension)
solid bodies | spacetime

### The 3 Gunas 

We combine this with Asian philosophy to say that monads vibrate in 3 ways according to the 3 influences or gunas:


Influence | Position 
--- | ---
Subtlifying | Above the gravitational signature
Transformative | Within the gravitational signature
Crudifying | Below the gravitational signature


These monads then make up the aether particles as the substance of the aethereal layer. The quality of these monads then build the strength, dynamism, and size of the particles in the layers below the aethereal. 


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World Simplified" >}}
Every substance has one principal attribute.
- Mind-substances have thinking as their one principal attribute.
- Body-substances have extension as their one principal attribute.
Thus:
- extension in length, width, and depth, constitutes the nature of corporeal substance.
- thought is the nature of thinking substance
{{< /q >}}


In ancient natural philosophy, the aether was called the 'substance' that filled all of Existence. 

Since it is two layers above the radiant layer which facilitates sight and touch, then it is not visible nor tangible.

It is detected in 2 ways:

1. Directly through intution

Intuitional detection of the aether is explained by Bio Superphysics. 

2. Indirectly through patterns from the visible layers 

This will be done in Material Superphysics through Qualimath.

{{< q a="Leibniz" >}}
Monads must have some qualities otherwise they would not be beings at all.. Every monad is necessarily different from every other monad.

<!-- Kepler lists 5 kinds of monads: 2 are of the immaterial category and 3 are material. Instead of calling them cube, tetrahedron, etc we call them do, re, mi, sol, la, as Pythagoras' "sesquialter" and the Chinese pentatonic scale. 

"Do" is the monad of planets, "Sol" is the monad of stars such as our sun. Thus, "La" is the monad of galaxies.

Kepler calls the gravity between the monads as "kinship". -->

<!-- Instead of using light as a yardstick, Kepler uses the gravitational relativity between two monads. There are 20, such as:
- Do-Do
- Do-Re
- Do-Mi
- etc. 

Newton's Gravity is therefore `Do-Do` and `Do-Sol`. 

Einstein's Special Relativity is `Mi-Mi` and `Mi-Re`. 

General Relativity is `Mi-Do` and `Mi-Sol`.-->
