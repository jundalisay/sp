In Cartesian Physics, all forces come from spinning virtual particles that pervade existence. These then go into receiver particles that get their motion in order to spin themselves. 

The spin of these non force particles creates phenomena that we can sense. 

For example, magnetism is caused by spinning virtual photons that go into channels in metals. 

This creates a magentic flux, which we call a virtual photon vortex, at the entrance and exit of the channels.  

This concentrates the virtual photons, allowing them to grab virtual space particles in order to exert an attractive or repulsive force in the direction of their travel. 

This is because all forces, whether gravity, magnetism, or contact forces, are caused by space particles. 

An easy way to understand this is to imagine the force particles as bolts that corkscrew into non force particles.

- Radiant force particles (photons, virtual photons) have an anticlockwise spin
- Convertible (weak) force particles (W Z bosons) have a clockwise spin

This is why the weak force interacts only with left handed particles.
