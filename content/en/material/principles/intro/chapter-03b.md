<!-- Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, Fermions, and Bosons -->

The most confusing thing about modern Physics is the messy classification of particles into Hadrons, Baryons, Mesons, Leptons, Fermions, and Bosons. 


## Bad Naming from the Ignorance of How Nature is Organized

The problem began when physicists started smashing atoms.
- Before this, particles were much simpler, as being electrons, neutrons or protons. 
- Smashing atoms revealed subatomic particles which then had to be classified. 

Modern Physics did not know the ancient Physics concept of the 5 Elements. 

Instead, they only knew Electromagnetism as the supreme principle which was called:
- the Fire Element in the ancient Physics 
- the 1st Element in Cartesian Physics 

'Spin' is the most obvious property of Electromagnetism.

And so physicists ended up classifying subatomic particles:
- based on spin (as fermions, bosons, and leptons) or
- based on quarks (as hadrons, baryons, mesons)

These classify an even messier naming convention of particles:
- Greek-based such as Proton, Electron, Tau
- Person such as Fermion, Boson, Higgs
- Silly such as Quark, Gluon, Up, Down, Charm, Strange  



## Overhauling the Particles

We fix this to make their naming more intuitive and therefore easier to remember by basing it on the ancient system.

 <!-- as intended by Rene Descartes who was the author of Physics before Newton. -->

This system divides everything in the universe as either a quantum-substance or a medium.
- The medium is where force works through.
- The substance is the discrete identity that reacts to the force. 
- The quantum is the smallest unit of substance.

The Graviton, Electromagnetic, Weak, and Strong Forces are replaced with Spacetime, Radiance, Convertible, and Material Layers respectively.

<!-- This is because all forces are really from the Aether ELement which manifests through Spacetime (i.e. gravity, magnetism, and contact forces make two things closer together in space). -->

Each Layer has a representative quantum-substance and a representative medium. 

For example:
- electrons represent the Radiant Element and is therefore renamed as "qor" or quantum of radiance
- light is the medium of Radiance and so photons are renamed into "mor" or medium of radiance
- neutrons represent the Convertible Element and becomes "qoc" 
- the W and Z bosons become "moc1" 

The same convention is applied to all the other Layers. In this way, people only need to know the 5 layer names.



## Polarity `♀ ♂ ⚥` Instead of Electromagnetic Charges

Charges in Physics are denoted as positive `+` or negative `-`, from Benjamin Franklin.

We replace this with male and female polarity.

Part | Name | Description
--- | --- | ---
North Pole of a Magnet | Male pole `♂` | Where virtual photons (striated particles) enter
South Pole of a Magnet | Female pole `♀` | Where virtual photons exit
Cathode | Female Terminal | Entrance of electrons (positive in Physics)
Anode | Male Terminal | Exit of electrons (negative in Physics)
Electrons (Negative Charge in Physics) | Masculine `♂` | Abundance of receivers 
Holes (Positive Charge in Physics) | Feminine `♀` | Lack of receivers 
Cations | Feminine Atom | An atom that loses electrons
Anions | Masculine Atom | An atom that gains electrons
Proton | som `♀` |  
Electron | qor `♂` |
Neutron | soc `⚥` | Neutral charge is bisexual

## Antiparticles `-`

Antiparticles are a reverse rotation or counterspin.

This is denoted with a negative sign in the front since the male symbol already denotes negative charge. This is different from Physics which is in a superscript.

For example, beta decay is denoted as:

```
soc → som + qor + -qoc1
```

Here, the convertible substance transforms into:
- a material substance
- a radiant quantum
- an anti-convertible quantum 



## Overhauling The Chemical Elements

The future discovery of the aether will lead to the creation or discovery of many more chemical combinations. This would overwhelm the mind with so many new names. 

This is why we simplify the naming of chemical elements by reducing superfluous data.*

{{< n n="We did this with news articles via bullet-style writing, which is a kind of dimensionality reduction of data" >}}


We rename them into their atomic number representing their Version of Matter (to be discussed in the part on the Material Layer).
- Hydrogen is `1` or `v1`
- Oxygen is `8`  or `v8`
- Water becomes `1(2)-8`  
- Table salt is `11-17`

Name | Chemistry | Superphysics
--- | --- | ---
Hydrogen | H | 1 or "v1"
Water | H2O | 1(2)-8 or "1-duo-8"
