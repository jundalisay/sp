The Law of Conservation of Idea in Physical Reality  | This manifests as Gravitational Signatures
{{< /dc >}} -->


Material Superphysics uses the wave-based paradigm of Superphysics to explain physical phenomena. 

Each particle is created when 2 Forces act on each other. 

This creates a duality of Existence-Consciousness in the same instant.

This Existence-Consciousness is called the Supreme Entity, called:
- Substance by Descartes and Spinoza 
- Brahma by Hinduism

The Positive and Negative keep on acting on Substance or Existence-Consciousness to create:
- the 5 Strata of Spiritual Superphysics for metaphysical phenomena
- the 5 Elements of Bio Superphyics for living phenomena
- the 5 Layers of Material Superphysics for physical phenomena

Each of these divisions has their own wave-range.

- Subtle waves exist in the metaphysical domain
- Crude waves exist in the physical domain

The amount of energy that can course through the substance depends on the **inherent configuration** of that substance. We call this the gravitational signature, notated as `G`.

> The energy that courses through a substance depends on its configuration


Historically, this configuration or inherent nature has been called:
- dharma (for general things)
- svadharma (for specific things)

Rene Descartes described these signatures as spinning vortices, each with its own strength and direction. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 8" >}}
When the pure aether began to be divided, its division began in one part and spread out to all its parts as equally as it could. However, this equality of division could not be perfect because the division could not spread in a straight line since there was no void. Instead, each division happened as circular motions with different centers. This is because God gave each particle a different motion.

In Modern Physics, this is known as the intial and inherent spin of the particle. 

It defines how things interact, not only with media and forces, but also with other substances and particles, and the rest of existence. 

The gravitational signature also explains the purpose or use of a substance or thing in Nature, working within the conservation laws.

The more of the 5 Layers an object exists in, the more complex its signature. 

For example, each physical thing has the following components for its gravitational signature.

Layer | Location
--- | ---
Aethereal | Relative Purpose in Nature
Spatial | Spacetime coordinates
Radiant | Energy level
Convertible | Ability for chemical reactions 
Material | Persistence

Assuming a thing is based on 5 units of idea, then there will be:
- one idea in each layer if it is physical or material 
- 3 ideas in the aether if it is metaphysical such as an elemental

{{< i s="/graphics/super/spread.jpg" a="Distribution of aether" >}} 

We call this the Law of Conservation of Idea of the Aethereal Layer which is matched by the Law of Conservation of Aether in the Convertible Layer. 

The Law of Conservation of Idea states that everything in reality is an idea of the Supreme.
- Each idea is unique and has a place in Existence since there is no Void in Nature.

Therefore, each gravitational signature is unique since it includes the location of the identity in spacetime. 

This is why no 2 physical things can occupy the same space. In Modern Physics, this manifests as the *Pauli Exclusion Principle*.

This is why:
- 'fermions' have specific states, but 'bosons' can bunch up
- you do not go 'through' your chair and occupy the same space that it does 

This is also why:
- a leaf is a separate identity from its tree
- a rock is a separate identity from its mountain
- a son is a separate identity from its parents and family  

<!-- However, above the spatial layer, everything can be at one place since space is no longer relevant. 

At that point,the wave nature of gravitational signatures becomes obvious. This leads to different qualities of identities as nodes. 
- Some nodes can be complex with so many waves in it
- Some nodes can be simple with just a few waves
- Some nodes can be subtle, made of thin waves that can wrap around the thick ones
- Some nodes can be crude, with thick waves that have less flexibility -->

<!-- This uniqueness is denoted in reality by a metaphysical signature which determines:

1. What Layer or physical body it exists as
2. What potential motions it can do 

Since motion is more striking to the mind, we call these as gravitational signatures or `G`. Each `G` when deployed in physical reality is known as the **monad** or qoa1. -->

<!-- interaction between these identities creates movement  -->


### The Gravitational Signature Determines What Layer the Identity Exists In

Since the universe is made up of waves and each wave is a representative of a layer or element, then the properties of that identity will reveal either:
- the layer (subscript `l`) that it is in. This in turn will help reveal its gravitational signature `G` 
- its gravitational signature `G`. This will help reveal what layer it is in*

{{< n n="Technically, the gravitational signature is in the upper aethereal layer." >}}


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sub.jpg" alt="Sublayers" c="The material waves are most obvious to humans which are also made up of material bodies" >}}


The exposure of the gravitational signature is done through aethereal probing which we call particle dialectics where the particle is imposed on. This is similar to interrogating a crime suspect, adding pressure to it to make it spill the beans. 


## Leads to Technologies 

In Material Superphysics, the exposure of gravitational signatures lead to technology-solutions, just as they lead to social solutions in Social Superphysics and medical solutions in Bio Superhysics, (and crime-solutions to police investigations according to the analogy of particle dialectics as interrogation):

- Fusion is solved by knowing the gravitational signature of hydrogen
- Levitation is solved by knowing the gravitational signature of the object
- Teleportation is solved by estimating the gravitational signature of the object at the other location 
- Time travel is solved by the same estimation but with the additional factor of the object's past. This is why time travel to the past will be easier than a travel to the future. 



<!-- The resulting energy can be used to reveal the G just as the G can be used to reveal the potential energy of the identity. 

This `G` is the "gravitational signature" and is really supposed to be `D` as dharma or `T` as tao or True Nature of Socrates. But that would turn away Westerners who have a distaste for non-Western ideas (which is a no-no if we are to unify the human species and put everyone, East and West, 'on the same page'). 

So we can stick with `G` as invented by the British Newton. 
- Like Newton, Socrates would think that this `G` is inherent to the body as what "objects carry in them"
- But unlike Newton who believed that `G` came from a material mass, the Socratic `G` comes from a metaphysical "true nature" which the Hindus call Dharma. 

In this way, the Socratic `G` still ends up as `D` if the thinking person chases it down. You could even say that `G` is the metaphysical DNA of everything in existence that dictates what movements it can do, and actually manifests as the DNA in physical living cells.

<!-- ### The Gravitational Signature is the Foundation of an Identity's Nature or its Motion


Aside from determining the Layer, a gravitational signature also determines the range of motions that arise from the attraction or repulsion by its affinity or difference with the other signatures, whether they are from objects, entities, or minds within the same layer.

Lower layers are affected by higher layers, but higher layers are unaffected by the lower. For example, light is affected by gravity, but gravity is not affected by light.


Layer | Motion Carriers (media)
--- | ---
Aethereal | Monad
Spacetime | Timespace
Radiant | Virtual Photons
Convertible | W Bosons 
 -->

<!-- Layer | Positive or Attraction | Negative or Repulsion 
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Attraction of related ideas and minds | Replusion of opposing ones
Spatial | Attraction to massive objects (vortices) | Repulsion to immaterial objects (non-vortices)
Radiant | Attraction of opposite charges | Repulsion of like charges
Convertible | Noninteraction that leads to nondecay | Interaction that decays the particle
Material | Gluons that form matter | Particle collisions that destroy that matter and convert them to spacetime) -->
 <!-- through the Law of Conservation of Idea -->

<!-- Knowing the `G` and the layer can also reveal what kind of particle it is. For example, the antimatter are created by the free aether aiming to upgrade matter.

Layer | Antiparticle
--- | ---
Radiant | positron :: -a(r)
Convertible | antineutrino :: -a(c)
Material | antihydrogen :: -a(H)

In theory, this means that peace and harmony can be achieved granularly by knowing the Gravitational signatures of everyone in order to reduce the repulsion of minds, and generally by imposing higher-layer ideas like virtue (this virtue-based socio-political system is then the job of Social Superphysics)" >}} -->
