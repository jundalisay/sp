There are 5 Layers in Reality | Each Layer has a sound

<!-- Cartesian Physics is a MODEL based on the aether. Cartesians then make THEORIES within that model. 

Bernoulli used it for pressure. Huygens used it for light. These have been proven. 

Newton and Einstein's Theories are not models.  -->



The universe is a reality that is made up of waves that can be neatly integrated and categorized into 5 Layers.

An analogy is a Photoshop image which is made up layers that are on top of each other. 

{{< img src="/graphics/super/layers.jpg" alt="Layers in an image" cap="Reality is made up of 5 Layers which the ancients called the 5 Elements" >}}

These layers were known to the ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese as the *5 Elements*. Currently, Modern Physics only knows 3 of the 5 as:

1. Strong Force
2. Weak Force 
3. Electromagnetism 

The 4th force as gravity and 5th force as the aether are not yet fully understood by Modern Physics. This is because Physics and Science from the 19th century chose to limit itself to visible and tangible perceptions, especially after electricity was discovered and harnessed.

The big problem with this is that those 2 missing Elements or Forces are immaterial and invisible.

## The Evolution of Physics from the Focus on the Visible

<!-- We can say that the dark ages are still in force. The bright spots were the Roman Empire Stoicism and the Enlightenment. Asia is also in its own dark ages, with the birght pots during the Buddhist and Taoist persiods and the the latter as Song Dynasty and   -->

<!-- Using math, Modern Physics began with a matter-first paradigm because matter is easily countable and plottable. In fact,  -->

Newton began Physics using moon observations since the moon is easily seen. Physics then jumped to the realm of electromagnetism when moving currents were discovered (as opposed to static electricity).

Over time, physicists classified forces into four:

1. Strong
2. Weak
3. Electromagnetism
4. Gravitation

Physicists are still mystified by gravity, as proven by the lack of anti-gravity technology.


## The Asian Model

Material Superphysics breaks through the limitations of Modern Physics by using the proper metaphysics from the ancient Greeks, Indians, and Chinese who all follow a 5-Element model: 

Greeks (Timaeus) | Hindus | Chinese | Greek Shape | Superphysics Shape
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- 
Aether (dodecahedron) | Akasha | 水 still water | Dodecahedron ![Dodecahedron](/graphics/physics/dode.gif) | Pentagon
Wind (octahedron) | Vayu | 木 moving wood | Octahedron ![Octahedron](/graphics/physics/octa.gif) | Square
Fire (tetrahedron) | Tejas | 火 radiant fire | Tetrahedron ![Tetrahedron](/graphics/physics/tetra.gif) | Line
Water (icosahedron) | Jala | 土 transforming earth | Icosahedron ![Icosahedron](/graphics/physics/icos.gif) | Dash
Earth (cube) | Pritvi | 金 solid metal | Cube ![Cube](/graphics/physics/cube.gif) | Dot


This model allows both visible perceptions through the eyes and invisible perceptions through the heart and intuition. We say this maxes out the human faculties, different from the current sciences which do not develop human potential to its fullest.


## Superphysics Uses Layers Instead of Fields, Ratios Instead of Equations

Physicists think in 'fields' as a consequence of Faraday assigning '[lines of force](/research/whittaker/aether/chapter-06)' to electromagnetic phenomena. 

But this is refuted by Timeaus who wrote that circular motion is the default motion, as a consequence of the universe having no void. 

{{< q a="Timaeus" >}}
The universe was made to move in the same way and on the same spot, within his own limits revolving in a circle. All the other 6 motions were taken away from it. As this circular movement required no feet, the universe was created without legs and without feet.
{{< /q >}}

This was later developed by Descartes in his theory of vortices. This is why we use layers (and slices) instead of fields.

The top layer, aether, always changes and so we use ratios (ratio sign) instead of equations (equal sign). This allows a flexible, subjective universe that matches the probability distribution in quantum mechanics, psychology, economics, biology, etc.

We then unify all the understandings of the Romans, Greeks, Hindus, and Chinese under our 5-Layer model, including their properties:

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" >}}
The category of the physical elements an object belongs to is determined by the tanmátra emanating from that object.
- The ethereal factor has the capacity of imbibing or carrying the sound tanmátra.
- The aerial factor has the capacity of imbibing or carrying the sound and touch tanmátra.
- The luminous factor, of the sound, touch, and form tanmátras.
- The liquid factor, of the sound, touch, form and taste tanmátras.
- The solid factor has the capacity of imbibing or carrying all five tanmátras: sound, touch, form, taste and smell.
