## Spin or Effort

The belligerence of the 2 Forces creates a consistent ratio of Positive and Negative in an identity. 

This leads to a vortex in the Substance which manifests as particle spin.

If the Negative Force is pure staticity and the Positive Force is pure dynamism, then a particle that spins at:
- 100% maximum has 100 units of Positive and 0 units of Negative
- 1% speed has 99 units of Negative and 1 unit of Positive   

If the Negative Force is pure rigidity and the Positive Force is pure flexibility, then a particle that spins at:
- 100% flexibility or changeability has 100 units of Positive and 0 units of Negative
- 1% flexibility (very rigid and forceful) has 99 units of Negative and 1 unit of Positive   

These spin configurations are then grouped by Nature into 5:

Layer | Configuration
--- | ---
Aethereal | Mostly Positive
Spatial |
Radiant | Balance of Both
Convertible |
Material | Mostly Negative



## Action from Effort

These layers and identities never exist in isolation. The contact of their spins exposes the differenecs in their configuration which manifests as relational action. 

Each layer and particle has a specific set or range of actions as part of the duty of expressing its original or causal idea. 
- This can be seen as their division of labor in creating reality. 

The actions of each layer or particle is unique but may have similarities to others.

Layer | Action
--- | ---
Aethereal | Malleability (Memory and flow or association)
Spatial | Separate identities and Move Things
Radiant | Spread of information
Convertible | Change and Oscillate
Material | Persist and Resist Motion or Change

## Perception as Impact of Action

These actions hit other actions as impact or perception. 

Action is the opposite of perception, just as output is the opposite of input. 
- Action is expression
- Perception is absorption

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Philosophy, Part 1, Article 26" >}}
There are only 2 modes of thinking in us: the perception of the understanding and the action of the will
{{< /q >}}


<!-- Layer | Actions
--- | ---
Aether | , expansion, attraction/repulsion
Spatial | splitting and isolation of perceptions, force
Radiant | ionformation-carrier, spread (invariance), entanglement, motion (straight-line, bouncing, bending, stopping or polarization)
Convertible | change, instability
Material | stability, contraction -->

The actions will be explained in the Chapter for each Layer.


## Forces from Impact

The differences in action, and therefore the spin qualities, reveal themselves upon impact or perception. 

We see and hear many things in a day. Yet we gravitate towards those things that make an impact on our minds. 

{{< i s="/graphics/super/impact.jpg" a="Impact" c="Living things create more impact or richer perception than nonliving things" >}}

Since minds have different spins then we all gravitate towards different things. This is why like and dislike is subjective and why beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  

In the physical domain, this translates to more massive material objects having more material force to fellow material objects. 

But this material force is not so relevant to radiant objects such as light which is not affected by mass*.
