Aristotle and Descartes defines substance as that which can exist by itself. 

The substances in physical reality, according to Material Superysics, are:

Layer | Substances
--- | ---
Aethereal | potential physical existence or 'mahat', physical identity  or 'aham' or ego, actual physical existence or citta (physical reality)
Spatial | time, blackhole (vortex), space
Radiant | spectrum, fire, electricity
Convertible | cosmic neutrinos, neutrons, acids bases
Material | proton, quasi crystals


These substances are part of the mega Substance that:
- Spinoza and Descartes calls God
- the Hindus call Brahma
- the tao by Taoism
- we call the Supreme Entity


This Existing Substance is different from Pre-Existence which is called:
- The One by Parmenides
- the Hindus call Nirguna Brahma
- the Tao by Taoism
- the Absolute Entity by Superphysics


{{< q a="Aristotle" c="Metaphysics, Book 10 Part 2" >}}
The substance and nature of the One exists in two ways.
