Chapter 3 explained that force particles are spinning bolts. 

It follows that non force particles are   are called media and all non-forces are called substances. 

The media represent the different forms of the perpetually dynamic Positive and Negative Forces where they originate from.  

These insert themselves into the substances that they are assigned to in order to create movement and change in physical reality. 

Example Medium or Force | Example  Substance or Quantum
--- | ---
Existential desire | Aether or Ideas
Gravity | Material vortices 
Virtual Photons | Electrons
W Boson | Neutron
Gas Contact Forces | Protons

This means that all movement comes externally but are ultimately based on the internal aethereal configuration of the substances that exist.

Examples are gravity, magnetism, and contact forces:
- Gravity caused by `mosts` (gravitons to Physics) going through and affecting matter and light  
- Magnetism is caused by `mors` (virtual photons to Physics)  going through electrons and other particles
- Tactile movement is caused by `moms` (contact forces to Physics) pushing or pulling matter. 


### Two Kinds of Movement

The energy transfer between media and substances then leads to 2 kinds of movement:

1. Sequential or Relative Movement

This is relativistic motion that matches the principles of Newton and Einstein. 

2. Non-Sequential Movement

This is true motion or aether-based motion that allows jumping between spacetime. An example is your movement in your dreams where you can jump from one scene into another non-sequentially. 

This is the foundation of teleportation and levitation. 

<!-- We can say that the media are the cause of movement and -->





In Cartesian Physics, all forces come from spinning virtual particles that pervade existence. These then go into receiver particles that get their motion in order to spin themselves. 

The spin of these non force particles creates phenomena that we can sense. 

For example, magnetism is caused by spinning virtual photons that go into channels in metals. 

This creates a magentic flux, which we call a virtual photon vortex, at the entrance and exit of the channels.  

This concentrates the virtual photons, allowing them to grab virtual space particles in order to exert an attractive or repulsive force in the direction of their travel. 

This is because all forces, whether gravity, magnetism, or contact forces, are caused by space particles. 

An easy way to understand this is to imagine the force particles as bolts that corkscrew into non force particles.

- Radiant force particles (photons, virtual photons) have an anticlockwise spin
- Convertible (weak) force particles (W Z bosons) have a clockwise spin

This is why the weak force interacts only with left handed particles.
