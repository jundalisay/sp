Chapter 1 introduced the idea of abstract particle shapes which are different from actual physical point particles.

These shapes come from the belligerence between the 2 Forces, the same principle that gives 'shapes' and 'spin' to ideas.

An idea can be:
- big or small
- powerful and viral, or weak and insignificant

Likewise, particles in the abstract can be:
- big or small
- have strong or weak spins

In the West, the concept of abstract shapes having physical effects was first known through Pythagoras. His ideas influenced Plato, leading to the Platonic solids.

In Asia, this concept is:
- in mandalas and yantras in Hinduism
- in i-ching and bagua and in Taoism 


<!-- Superphysics sees ideas as static metaphysical objects that have a certain [geometry](/superphysics/principles/chapter-03e). This was what Euclid's Element was all about: -->


## The Abstract Shapes of the 5 Elements

We apply the concept of abstract shapes to the quanta of the MSQ Model of the 5 Layers which was fully explained by Euclid in his book aptly called *The Elements*.

Euclid | Topic | Layer 
--- | --- | ---
Book 1 | Triangles | Aethereal
Book 2 | Rectangles | Spatial
Book 3 | Circles | Radiant
Book 4 | Circles in Squares | Convertible
Book 5 | Ratios | Relationality
Book 6 | Numbers | Material

Shallow people judge with their eyes and thought that Euclid was explaining visual shapes.
- And so they think his book was about shapes.

In reality, he was talking about the dynamics of the 5 Elements.  

These 3 authors were writing about the 5 Elements. Kepler and Descartes did the same in an indirect way. 

<!-- 1. Euclid
2. 
3. Descartes -->

By combining their principles and merging them with those of Taoism and Hinduism, which learned of the 5 Elements earlier than the Europeans, we can create the following shapes for the particles in Material Superphysics.

{{< dc t="How We Got These" >}}
We derived these shapes after listing down:

1. The steps in our theory of how the Supreme creates reality in real time

This is the creation of particles of downgrade from idea to matter.

2. The effects of the Radiant layer particles namely the photon (light) and virtual photon (magnetism)  

This is how the particles interact. 

3. The steps of particle decay from collisions

This is the decay of particles or upgrade from matter back to the aether.

Some of these particles do not exist in Physics which only knows 3 of the 5 Elements.

This visualization will help us intuitively think of particle interactions.

For example, there is currently a mystery why there is a discrepancy between the predicted mass of the W boson and the actual measured mass. 

Our shapes system gives a clue that the culprit is in the neutrinos. This is because in our classification, neutrinos are in the same Layer as the W Boson, but have a flat shape.


### How it Works


The Euclidean Postulates can be suummed up in a few words:

1. Point to Point

We interpret this as the aether particle.

2. Infinite Line

We interpret this as the finite aetherspace that can extend indefintely.

3. Circle

We interpret this as the "round" action of photons which are shaped as circle in a line.

4. Right Angles

We interpret this as the left and right handed spin of the Weak Interaction

5. Meeting at a Point

We interpret this as the triangle created by gluon flux tubes (3 aetherspace particles). 



Each quantum particle is made up aether particles which can either be:
- round
- flat


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 3, Article 87" >}}
They are small columns, hollowed out with 3 spirals like screw-threads. This lets them pass through those narrow passages while twisting
{{< /q >}}


These particles can be arranged in 2 ways:
- as a plane structure
- as a column structure


Force particles are generally tall because this gives them power to bore through other particles. 

Matter particles are generally shaped into a plane so that they can receive the force particles. 


Physics Name | Superphysics Version
--- | ---
Magnetic Moment | Size of Hole of Charged (or Gendered) Particle
Charge | Rotation Direction
Male Charge | Rotating Positively or Anticlockwise
Female Charge | Rotating Negatively or Clockwise
Spin | Orientation to Virtual Photon (means particle has thickness). A + spin means 
Electromagnetic Mass | Size (or Thickness?) of Hole to use Virtual Photons
Material Mass | Aetherspace Strength


## Why Use Particle Shapes?

Particle shapes remove the need for Feymann diagrams. This is because Feynman used action principles to trace paths in quantum mechanics.

However, Descartes' Physics uses vortices wherein spin is more important than paths. Rather, the path is the effect of the spin. This is how meteorologists plot typhoon movement from their eye.
