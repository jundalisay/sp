Cartesian-Spinoza Physics explains how the universe works. 

It begins with the 5 Elements which is consistent with Hindu and Taoist Physics. 

The 2 Forces are of God and the Deceiver. In Hinduism this is Shiva and Shakti. In Taoism this is Yang and Yin. 

The belligerence of those 2 forces create polarities which create vortices in the Hierarchy of Elements. 

In the aether (0th) Element this is union versus division.  

In the spacetime (2nd) Element this is seen as anticlockwise and clockwise rotation of galaxies and quasars. 

In the electromagnetic (1st) Element, this is seen as negative versus positive charnges. 

In the weak (water) ELement this is seen as left-hand versus right-hand spin. 

In the strong (earth, 3rd) Element this is seen as matter versus antimatter. 

These 2 Forces cancel each other out. 

The problem for Modern Physics is that the aether and spacetime Elements are superior to 3 lower Elements (strong/Earth, weak/Water, and electromagnetism(EM)/Fire. 

So of course, symmetries in the aether and spacetime can never be detected by the LHC which uses EM. This is why dark matter can never be found. 

Instead, galaxies are held together by invisible spacetime particles which function differently in stars (1st Element) and matter (3rd Element). This is why Newton's inverse square law does not work in gravity rotation nor cosmic expansion. 

So we should pity those physicists trying to look for dark matter just as we pity those Christians looking for the holy grail. 

The proper understanding of the 2nd Element then unlocks at least levitation technology which is essential for nuclear fusion.
