The constants in Nature are the fixed ratios between the 5 Layers. 



### The Internal Boundary Constant: 241,056

The easiest ratios are for the internal boundaries and the highest quantum for each layer which we peg to approximately 241,056:

Bondary (value) | Quantum (value) | Ratio
--- | --- | --- 
Edge of Universe (93b light years) | Average Size of Galaxy (300m light years) | approx 310,000 
Higgs Boson (125.35 GeV) | Electron (0.511 MeV) | 245,303 (5131355 base 6)
X17 (17 MeV) | Electron Neutrino (0.07 MeV) |242,857 (511,2201)

<!-- converter 241,056 -->

<!-- 9,192,631,770 : 299,792,458 gives ratio 30.6633189885 -->


### Spatial-Radiant: 30.6633

For example, a well-known constant is the speed of light (Radiant) which is the distance that it travels in 1 second (Spatial) which is really 9,192,631,770 vibrations of the Cesium 55 atom. 

This gives a ratio of 30.6633

Here, the choice of time length is arbitrary, which is really based on the rotation of the Earth divided into seconds.

<!-- So the higher layer is the Spatial which is used to judge the Radiant, as light, as it moves in 1 unit of time.  -->


### Material-Spatial

Subordinate movemment leads to circles and curves from a central point. This leads to circular ratios:

<!-- 1 second is based on a constant of oscillations of the Cesium atom (Material) when put under microwave radiation (Radiant). 

And so the Physics measure for the universe is based on the Material Layer.  -->

Constant | Value | Meaning
--- | --- | --- 
Pi | 3.14.. | Vortex
Golden Ratio | 1.618 | Loose Vortex
Gravity | (6.6743 ± 0.00015) × 10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2 | Material-Spatial
Fine Structure Constant | 0.00729927007 | Radiant-Aetherspace

<!-- Speed of light | 299,792,458 | | Radiant-Spatial 
Second | 9,192,631,770 Hz | | Radiant-Material -->

<!-- Beam of Cesium Atoms:
    Cesium atoms are heated and passed through a vacuum chamber.

Microwave Field Exposure:

    The atoms are exposed to microwaves at different frequencies.
If the frequency exactly matches the natural resonance of cesium, atoms will absorb energy and transition between energy states.

Detecting the Transition:

    A magnetic filter removes atoms that didn’t transition.

    A detector counts how many atoms changed states.

    The experiment is repeated at slightly different frequencies until the maximum transition is observed.

Finding the Exact Frequency:

    The frequency that causes the maximum transition is determined to be 9,192,631,770 Hz.

    This means one second is defined as the time it takes for cesium-133 to oscillate exactly 9,192,631,770 times. -->
