The interaction between gravitational signatures naturally lead to gravitational territories which represent the space of the identity. In Physics, this is known as fields:
- 'Gravitational fields' refer to gravity
- Quantum Field Theory refers to quantum objects

Rene Descartes described these signatures as spinning vortices, each with its own strength and direction. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 8" >}}
When the pure aether began to be divided, its division began in one part and spread out to all its parts as equally as it could. However, this equality of division could not be perfect because the division could not spread in a straight line since there was no void. Instead, each division happened as circular motions with different centers. This is because God gave each particle a different motion.

{{< f f="*Quantum physics uses fields because it arose from electromagnetism which has magnetic fields. This is not useful in Superphysics because the aether is the most superior layer and we never think that feelings or minds have fields. Instead feelings and minds have layers -- there are deep and shallow minds, feelings, and ideas. Moreover, identities have territories or personal space, i.e. We say 'this is mine'." >}}


Instead of vortices in the aether, Physics uses fluctuations in the quantum fields such as a photon field, electromagnetic field, electric field, muon field, etc.




Each territory has parts or zones, each with different properties:

Zone | Properties
--- | ---
Inner   | has the most stability 
Middle  | protects the stability 
Outer   | has the most space 
Edge    | has highest energy levels

{{< img alt="Gravitational Territories" src="/graphics/physics/territories.jpg" cap="" >}}

These 4 zones match the:
- 4 groups of Electron Shells of Electrons
  - 1s-2s
  - 2p-4s
  - 3d-6s
  - 4f-7p 
- 4 orbits of solar systems 
  - Goldilocks zone
  - Large Planet zone
  - Oort Cloud
  - Stellar Halo


This is also seen in galaxy rotation curves which have different dynamics from that predicted by Newton's inverse square law. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/rotation.jpg" alt="Galaxy Rotation Curves" cap="The division of a territory into 4 parts is seen in both the orbits in our solar system and in the rotation curves of a spiral galaxy. This removes the need for dark matter to explain gravitational lensing and galaxy rotation. The outer arms of a galaxy move fast compared to the outer area of a solar system (which moves slowly) because of the difference of the Spatial and Radiant Layers" >}}


## Works on BAOs too


The spherical shape matches that of the baryonic acoustic oscilations (BAOs) which are seen from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These act like bubbles or ripples, consistent with the liquid nature of vortices and is why the Chinese called the aether as water.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/bao.jpg" alt="baryonic acoustic oscilation" >}}

- The ripples are spacetime while the gaps between themm are the aetherspace.
- The origin of the ripple is the main idea while the resulting galaxy clusters in the ripple are the ideas arising from it.


This rippling of gravitational territories then leads to our Multiverse Theory that is based on Cartesian Physics which views the aether as an invisible liquid substance that fills everything.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 13" >}}
The conclusion is that the force that causes them to go towards E is vibratory in nature. As the particles change position, it increases or relaxes those diverse small vibrations.  
{{< /q >}}


Changes or movement in the aether are done through vibrations, different from particles that are moved by contact. 


## What Happens at the Edge?

The edge of the universe is the CMB which has the fuzzy microwave images of more distant galaxies.

Going to the edge of the universe linearly is not possible, since the aetherspace blocks matter just as it facilitates contact forces.

The only solution is to be in a ship that teleports to the edge of that universe. This will then expand the visible universe, allowing the ship to discover new galaxies to go to.


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/multiverse.jpg" alt="Multiverse" cap="The proper movement to escape the confines of the current universe is to use the Positive Force to go up the multiverse ladder">}}

This will be discussed more in the Part on Spacetime.
