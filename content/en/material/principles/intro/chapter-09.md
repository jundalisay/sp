The ignorance of Physics on the nature of the universe leads to the Standard Model of Physics which is very flawed, unable to account for gravity, dark matter, and dark energy.

Material Superphysics solves this through the 5 Layers Model derived from the ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Taoists.

Name | Physics Counterpart | Layer | Description 
--- | --- | --- | ---
Abstract mechanics | Theoretical Physics | Aether | This replaces theoretical physics which is stuck with imaginary mathematics
Quantum mechanics | same | Aether | This puts quantum mechanics under aether principles to remove its 'spookiness'
Radiant mechanics | Optics, Mechanical Engineering | This focuses on the radiant (entropic) media of light and heat
Electron mechanics | Electrical Engineering | This focuses on electrons and its effects as electricity and magnetism
Neutrino mechanics | Particle Physics | This focuses on neutrinos as supplemental information about the universe
Reactive mechanics | Chemistry, Nuclear Physics | This focuses on chemical and particle reactions 
Particle mechanics | Nuclear Physics | This focuses on proton and quark dynamics
Material mechanics | Material Sciences | This focuses on lattice structures of molecules



<!-- ### Organizes the Subsciences

The MSQ model organizes the scopes of each sub science such as optics, astrophysics, chemistry, particle physics, theoretical physics, etc.  -->


<!-- ### Differences Between MSQ and Standard Model Particles 

The MSQ model also exposes some differences between Particle Physics and Particle Superphysics regarding neutrons and neutrinos.
- Physics classifies neutrinos under Electromagnetism (Radiant Layer) and neutrons under the Strong Force (Material Layer). This is because neutrinos run at nearly the speed of light and because neutrons have quarks.
- Superphysics, on the contrary, classifies both under the Convertible Layer or Weak Force. This is because they facilitate change or the conversion of matter just like the W and Z Bosons.
