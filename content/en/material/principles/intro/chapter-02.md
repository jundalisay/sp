The 2 Forces in Physical Reality | This manifests as polarities in the 5 Layers
{{< /dc >}}


The 2 Forces act on each layer to create internal polarities

This leads to vibrational waves that manifests as vortex rotation.

These vibrations lead to 3 states as positive, netural, and negative.

An identity can spin independently of others, or have its spin match those of others. 

- If it spins dependently, then it sticks with the collective
- If it spins independently, then it stands out and is perceptible out of the mass or collective that it is in

If it spins independently, then it can either:
- dominate the collective, or
- be booted out

If it dominates then it makes the collective subservient to it. This will make them revolve around its spin. In the large scale this manifests as quasars.

It can also dominate others while keeping the same spin direction. This manifests as galaxies in the large scale .

If booted out, then it will naturally settle in a place where it can harmonize with its surrounding particles. In the spatial layer, this facilitates the expansion of the universe.

It follows that a vortex is formed from energy imbalance, when one particle is stronger than the rest.

This means not all phenoena has vortices. The Positive and Negative thus express themselves differently when there is a vortex or no vortex.

<!-- This is described by the 4th Rule of Cartesian Motion which is about the presence of absence of vortices. 

This allows us an easier way to classify the polarities in phenomena so that all phenomena happen:

1. Independently

This is when the identity is alone. This leads to vortex-less phenoemena. This is Negative.

2. Dependently

This is when the identity is not alone. This leads to vortex phenoemena. This is Positive. -->

In the Probability Layer, this manifests as the possibility of being perceived or non-being perceived.

<!-- > e.g. "Unicorns do not exist. Horses do." -->


In the Aethereal Layer, this manifests as:
- creative or destructive.
- energetic or non-energetic.

<!-- > e.g. "Evolution speeds up the more aether that you have." -->


In the Spatial Layer, this manifests as:
- clockwise supermassive blackholes called quasars and anticlockwise ones as galaxies
- gravity and lack of gravity

<!-- > e.g. "A quasar is brighter than a galaxy" -->


In the Radiant Layer, this manifests as:
- a male charge for the negative charge in Physics, and female charge for the positive charge
- particle spin 0 and 1, versus 1/2, 3/2, 5/2


<!-- > e.g. "Like charges (male and male, female and female) repel." -->


In the Convertible Layer, this manifests as:
- left- and right-handed helicity
- reaction and non-reaction

<!-- . This is required in 'weak' interaction or flavor changing which we call conversion. 

> e.g. "All neutrinos are left-handed and undergo flavor changing." -->


In the Material Layer, this manifests as:
- matter versus antimatter
- solids versus gases

<!--  color charge and anti-color charge. This is required for antimatter. 

> e.g. "Matter is annihilated when it meets antimatter." -->


The details of each duality will be explained in each Part.
