Before Newtonian Physics was created, the mainstream Physics was from Descartes who used a 5 Element paradigm which was derived from the Physics of Aristotle and Timaeus. This was consistent with the 5 Elements model of Hinduism and Taoism.

This model had 5 Elements, 3 of which are known by Physics as the Standard Model 

Element | Physics Equivalent
--- | ---
Aether | Pseudo science
Air | Spacetime
Fire | Electromagnetism
Water | Weak Force
Earth or Matter | Strong Force


## The Subjectivity of the Aether

This model is confusing for materialists because it makes the aether as the supreme Element and matter or mass as the lowest and most inferior.

We define the **aether** as the **substance** of ideas, feelings, and the abstract minds that have those ideas and feelings. 

This is why the aether is the core ingredient in quantum mechanics which creates superposition and decoherence -- the observing mind is part of the system being tested!

This is why quantum mechanics is spooky to materialist physicists who see matter as the highest Element, when in fact it is the lowest and crudest. 


<!-- The usual problem that they find is that the aether is arbitrary and irregular and cannot be clamped down as an exact science.  -->


<!-- Operationally, this aether manifests as *citta* or mind-stuff in Vedic science. 

This leads to the concept of Existence being a huge mind called *Brahma*. For those allergic to Hinduism, we replace it with a virtual supercomputer so that we are inside a virtual reality, similar to the Simulation Hypothesis.  -->

The aether serves as the foundation of the abstract sciences such as psychology, politics, economics, sociology, just as matter and energy serve the foundation of Physics and Engineering. 

The life sciences such as biology, medicine, and agriculture are in between both. 

<!--  (culture, trends, etc), philosophy, and so on. 
- Matter serves as the foundation of the physical sciences such as physics, chemistry, astronomy, etc.
-->

<!-- This is why materialists see the random and arbitrary nature of quantum superposition as weird and spooky just because it always escapes their exact predictions and models. 

And so matter-ialists like Newton refute Cartesian Physics, which is quantum-first and based on aethereal vortices (chakras to the Asian sciences), and replace it with his own matter-based Physics, which is regular and predictable.

q a="Newton" >}}
The hypothesis of vortices is problematic. It says that the periodic times of the planets [and comets] may obtain the 3/2th power of their distances from the sun. I have explained that the motions of the comets are very regular. These cannot be accounted for by the hypothesis of vortices as axes because comets have very elliptical orbits -->


<!-- Everything changed when Newton came to the picture and enshrined mass as the cause of gravity in a space that was absolute. This is totally different from the other sciences which put the aether as the cause.* -->

## Einstein Debunking the Aether

Materialists hate subjectivity so much that they do everything that they can to discredit the subjective aether that is the basis of the subjective universe. This is exactly what Einstein did when he interpreted the Michelson-Morley experiment in favor of electromagnetism, while denouncing the abstract mind (soul, feelings).


{{< q a="Einstein" c="On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" >}}
These two postulates of Relativity suffice for a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell’s theory for stationary bodies.  The introduction of a “luminiferous ether” is superfluous. There is no need for an “absolutely stationary space” that has special properties. 
{{< /q >}}


Einstein created Relativity by simply ignoring the aether that would later facilitate quantum mechanics. This is why he was against quantum mechanics in his paper "Is the Quantum—Mechanical Reality Complete?".

The consistent success of quantum mechanics and the consistent failure of theories derived from General Relativity such as String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, Supersymmetry, Big Bang, Wormholes, White Holes, etc show that Nature is quantum mechanical, and not Einstein-Relativistic. 


<!-- i s="/graphics/physics/rotation2.jpg" a="Descartes vs Newton" c="Descartes wrote that objects at the outer part of vortices travel faster than those in the middle part. Newton debunked this by citing the speeds of comets which are slow at the edges of the solar system. But galaxy rotation data shows that the speed of the outer part of galaxies are faster than the middle, matching Descartes' prediction" -->


<!-- n n="This has been proven since ancient times by Hindu and Buddhist monks who are able to levitate without exerting physical force. This is why gravity is no longer a mystery and is case closed" >}} -->

<!-- Instead of mass being the lowest Element, Newtonian Physics made it the supreme Element. 

Because it does not represent the truth of Nature, Newtonian mechanics started breaking down when electromagnetism was more observed.
- Light moved in waves instead of lines. 
- Electrons did not move along Newtonian orbits. 
- More importantly, the constant speed of light proved that space was not absolute. 

All these findings are consistent with the 5 Elements model which has the aether as the top Element. 

q a="Lorentz" c="Considerations on Gravitation" >}}
The state of the ether which is the cause of gravitation is propagated in a similar way as that which exists in the electromagnetic field.

The Michelson Morley experiment that proved the constancy of light therefore actually proves the Cartesian Aether. 

So why do physicists say that it debunked the aether? -->



Einstein only really doubled down on the non existence of the aether, called the 'aether drag', when he had to formalize General Relativity. 


{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity" >}}
There is no such thing as a “specially favoured” (unique) coordinate system that allows the æther-idea. Hence, there can be no æther-drift nor any experiment with which to demonstrate it.
{{< /q >}}


## The Huygens Ether, Frensel Ether, and Descartes Aether are Different

Einstein's statement shows the confusion of physicists on the aether idea. 

Aether | Superphysics Equivalent
--- | ---
Descartes | Aether
Huygens | Pure Spacetime via Light
Fresnel | Spacetime in Material Layer via Light
Stokes | Spacetime in Material Layer via Matter
Maxwell | Spacetime in Radiant Layer via Light
Helmholtz and Kelvin | Aetherspace in Material Layer via Heat

As you can see there were many aether ideas. The modern luminiferous aether theory is from Fresnel who described light moving in a crystal, making it variant and directional. 

{{< q a="Fresnel" c="Memoir On The Diffraction Of Light, Section 2" >}}
The intensity of light is proportional to the square of the speeds of the particles. The intensity of vibration, on the other hand, is the speed of an ether particle during its oscillation.
{{< /q >}}

However, the Michelson-Morley experiment proved that the light was *invariant*. Therefore, it debunked the *variant* Fresnel ether.


## Invariance as Proof of the Subjectivity of the Universe

To Descartes, light is invariant because light's job is to relay information about the light source which in turn is a spatial vortex. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Dioptrique, Chapter 1" >}}
Light is the carrier of the lively action which passes towards our eyes from a luminous body
{{< /q >}}

This invariance shows the independence of spatial vortices (2nd Element) from each other, something that matter (3rd Element) does not have. 

Fresnel's aether is based on matter and so it is variant. This applies to light within glass or crystals and is the mechanism for our proposed optical computing. 

Unlike rotating matter, a spatial vortex spins through time in independent moments. This makes it subjective or invariant. 

Physisists then used this invariance to create failed gauge theories:

{{< youtube UBNU-wKk5Mg >}}


<!-- To save the Fresnel ether theory, Lorentz created the concept of length contraction which allowed the shapes of **material** bodies to vary in accordance with the invariance of space. 

q a="Hendrik Lorentz" >}}
If one assumes the theory of Fresnel, then we can learn something about the change of dimensions.

The correctness of length contraction proves that:
- the 2nd Element (space particles) are invariant because there is no Void in Nature
- the 3rd Element (matter) is variant because it is different from space -->


<!-- This is totally different from the aether of Huygens which is now called the fabric of spacetime. Note that even this fabric is different from the original aether of Descartes. 

We bridge the Huygens aether with the Descares aether through the concept of the aetherspace.  -->


<!-- Fresnel's ether is Descartes' 2nd Element (space particles) mixed with the 3rd Element (matter particles). This is why it is **variant** just because light becomes variant when mixed with matter (such as when light passes through crystals).

This is in contrast to Huygen's aether which is Descartes' pure 2nd Element without any matter. At this point, none of them are actually the pure aether (5th Element) of Descartes  -->


## The Problem Began with Huygens, Made Worse by Fresnel

The whole confusion with the aether and space began when Huygens wrongly renamed the pure 2nd Element as Ethereal matter. This mixed it up with the pure aether as the 5th Element.

{{< q a="Christiaan Huygens" c="Treatise On Light" >}}
The movement of light coming from the luminous body is propagated through what I call “Ethereal matter”. It is not the same that serves for the propagation of sound.
{{< /q >}}

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/huygenschap1d.png" a="Huygens aether" c="The Huygens aether is actually the 2nd Element of Descartes or spacetime, different from the pure aether (what we call the 5th Element)" >}}


<!-- **Huygen's ether is actually Descartes' 2nd Element** -- the invisible space-time particles that create vortices. These are consistent with malleable spacetime that warps according to mass.  -->

{{< n n="In *The World*, Descartes actually calls all the 3 Elements as aether. The pure aether is called *substance*. This is because all Cartesian particles are virtual. But this is confusing to modern Physics which believes that all particles are real and only some are virtual. So to strike a compromise, we put the virtual aether as the 5th Element. The 2nd Element is also virtual but not totally aethereal as we can clearly see the space around us (the aetherspace and timespace are aethereal)" >}}


<!-- The 2nd Element, as empty space, propagates light, while the 3rd Element, as air or matter, propagates sound. -->

<!-- Fresnel observes that the speed of light:
- moves as waves
- is not constant when it moves through physical media

Unlike Huygens who knew the 5 Elements, **Fresnel did not know the division of labor of Nature**. 

This caused him to assign a drag whenever light moved through media such as glass or water. This was proven through a prism and through the Fizeau experiment that ran light through columns of flowing water.  -->


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/1960s.png" a="Huygens aether" c="The misnaming of Huygens on the 2nd Element created the confusion about the properties of space and the aether" >}}



## Space-Time is Not Material

The final error of Physics is to think that the either the aether or the 2nd Element are material in nature. 

In reality, they are metaphysical because they are above electromagnetism (1st Element). They can only be detected by the aethereal mind which is made of the same substance:
- the mind can detect all 5 Elements
- instruments can only detect 3 Elements

 <!-- through its ideas and feelings of space and time.  -->


This makes Physics perpetually impotent in discovering the full properties of Nature. This is why our proposed Superphysics has both physics and metaphysics combined.

This will allow us to discover their properties in order to develop technologies that defy space and time, such as levitation, teleportation, and time travel.  


<!-- 
In Cartesian Physics, the drag on light (1st Element) by the Fresnel aether is caused by matter (3rd Element), as glass and water.

**It is not caused by spacetime** (2nd Element). 

Rather, the impact of the 2nd Element on light is to limit it to 300,000 kilometers per second.

All that Lorentz had to do what to remove the matter in the Michelson interferometer as to create a light beam that runs on pure space. This light beam would then go with space to reveal its properties. 

This is exactly how the LIGO lasers in a vacuum prove gravitational waves and therefore the liquid nature of the 2nd Element, validating Descartes.  

> The LIGO lasers prove the liquid nature of the 2nd Element, validating Descartes

It is true that light travels through the medium of spacetime. **But this spacetime is not material in nature**. Rather it is energetic, having a wave-nature just as all other energies. 

Behind this energy is its aethereal cause, as the 5th Element, which is inherently arbitrary and ever-changing because it is above space and time. 

The same cause of quarks popping into existence is the same one for galaxies forming out of nowhere. 

This principle is the foundation of:
- superposition in quantum mechanics
- multiverses where each universe has its own spacetime with different top speeds


This is why Cartesian Physics matches both the findings of Newtonian Physics and Quantum Mechanics. Therefore, to Descartes:
- the 2nd Element should be called "space-time" and not the "ether"
- the medium for physical sound is then the 3rd Element or matter, such as the physical air. 
- light is invariant, not sped up nor slowed down by space-time
- light is slowed down by 3rd element or matter and is at maximum speed when free from matter.
- light is confined to its top or constant speed by the aetherspace which is a part of the 2nd Element  -->

<!-- i s="/graphics/physics/1960s.png" a="elements" c="Huygens wrongly called Descartes' spacetime as the ether. The Michelson-Morley experiment therefore proved the Cartesian 2nd Element. It does not debunk anything Cartesian because Descartes never said that spacetime was material (since it is matter or 3rd Element that drags light)" -->


<!-- ### The Scammer Einstein

The confusion caused by wrong names allows the scammer Einstein to emerge from nowhere and decree the simultaneity of time.

This totally flips Nature and imposes that empty space is a material cause for gravity that warps things. 

This warping creates absurdities such as:
- gravity not being a force
- centrifugal forces not being real
- a difference between inertial and gravitational mass (i.e. Einstein invents inertial mass for 'moving' gravity)
 -->

<!-- The Michelson-Morley experiment then proved that the speed of light is constant within the pure 2nd Element (called vacuum by Physics).

But instead of physicists vindicating Descartes, Einstein comes out of nowhere messing up Physics by imposing 2 axioms:

1. The invariance of the speed of light*
2. Equivalence of gravitational and inertial mass -->

<!-- This is even worse that Newton because **it makes the 2nd Element dependent on mass (3rd Element) via light (1st Element)**.

This prevents faster-than-light-travel and levitation with far less energy. These can be used to solve so many problems today that are out of reach just because a single Einstein corrupted Physics, putting it in limbo state for over 100 years. 

We explain the scam of Einstein [here](/material/fallacies/scam/).

We explain the huge damage that Einstein's scam has caused [here](/material/fallacies/einstein/).

We fix this with [Cartesian Relationality](/material/fallacies/general-relativity/) by restoring the 5 Elements. 

{{< n n="In Dioptrique, Descartes already explained that the nature of light is determined by its light source (which is light-vortex) and not the space that it goes through. Therefore it is invariant according to its source." >}}
