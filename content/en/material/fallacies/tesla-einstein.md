In July 1935 on this 79th birthday, Tesla asserted, just as we are asserting, that Einstein's Relativity was false:

{{< q a="Nikola Tesla" c="New York Times, 1935" >}}
The theory of relativity is a mass of error and deceptive ideas violently opposed to the teachings of great men of science of the past and even to common sense. It wraps all these errors and fallacies and clothes them in magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king. Its exponents are very brilliant men, but they are metaphysicists rather than scientists. Not a single one of the relativity propositions has been proved.

Why was Tesla so against Relativity?

This is because Relativity imposes limitations based on Electromagnetism, as the sequential or linear speed of light.

However, Tesla's proposed invention -- a global energy transmission system -- required near-instant electricity transmission. 

This is proven by Veritasium's experiment which showed that energy was transmitted near instantly because it actually comes from the space just beside the wire:

We explain that Tesla's system would work because empty space, called the 2nd Element in Cartesian Physics, is full of potential energy that it then gets from the aetherspace which is a subtle kind of 2nd Element that connects to the aether or 5th Element. 

The energy of space is now called virtual photons, as it facilitates electromagnetism.

The big problem is that Eintein's Theory only accepts visible energy as light or matter. These then move independently sequentially across empty space. 

This is visualized by the metric tensor which is the core component of Relativity. Accordingly, it is also the one that we bash the most, unlike Tesla who instead bashes the speed limit.


This linear thinking (sequential spacetime), as opposed to instant-thinking (arbitrary and independent spacetime), is what Tesla (and Superphysics) is bashing. 


## The Aether is Superior to Electromagnetism

In Cartesian Physics, and in Nature, the aether as the 5th Element is superior to Electromagnetism as the 1st Element (which we call the Radiant Layer)

The aether was called substance, which Tesla agrees with: 

{{< q a="Nikola Tesla" >}}
Man can increase or decrease his velocity of movement by the mysterious power he possesses by appropriating more or less energy from other substance, and turning it into motive energy.

## The Religion of Physics

Tesla is very correct in bashing Einstein who used the garb of mathematics to perpetuate his scam.

This strengthens our assertion that Physics has become a religion that uses the elitist language of mathematics. This is similar to how:

- The Catholic Church hid its dogmas under the elitist language of Latin
- The Hindus hid behind the elitist language of Sanskrit

These were freed up:

- Martin Luther translated the Bible into German
- Buddha taught Buddhism in Pali instead of Sanskrit

This is why we are creating Supermath and Qualimath, not only to account for the arbitrary aether, but also to make math easier for everyone. 


<!-- Another problem is that he seems to make bold predictions such as aluminum being dominant in industry replacing copper and other metals, despite knowing of its weakness. -->


## The Solution

It is true that Tesla's promises are possible. He seemed to know about the properties of the liquid aether. 

He knew Buddhism enough to quote the Buddha.

**But the problem is that he didn't seem to know the properties of the pure aether nor aethereal vortices.**

This is why his experiments failed. 

The proper way of making his global transmission system work is to detect the 2nd Element around the Earth that will actually facilitate the energy transmission, then unify with it by matching its frequency.

Our generation has a huge advantage over Einstein and Tesla because we not only have the internet, but also have AI. So there's no *intellectual* excuse to not know the properties of the aether.

The real problem of today is the high cost of making experiments and of the many preoccupations of modern life.

This is because experiments with the aether take a long time (since the aether is just above spacetime). But the quick modern life forces people to get instant results as time has become more precious due to the increased opportunity cost of having many possible things to do. 

If there are no results after a day or two, then it's a waste of time. 

But this obsession with time, as opportunity cost, is really a result of the economic system enshrining money which is static in Nature.

This is why our first focus is developing and pushing for a moneyless system.


<!-- is merely a test of equipment. 

This is the reasoning that arises from applying Einstein's own 'Definition of Simultaneity' in the real world, away from theory.

Back in Newton's time, telescopes were inaccurate and so observations could not detect the small details such as the tilting of the revolution of a planet.

The prevailing equation was Newton's law at F = G(m1m2/r^2) where mass was derived by sight through the medium of light. This manifested as the speed and luminosity of a planet while it revolved around the sun.


## The Vulcan Fallacy

The inaccuracies of early telescopes led to discrepancies which then led to wrong predictions. 

For example, Le Verrier in 1859 used Newton's Law to predict Mercury's position. But he could not find Mercury where it was supposed to be, citing a discrepancy of 43 arc seconds per century. 

This led him to waste his effort to hypothesize that a non-transiting planet 'Vulcan' was attracting Mercury causing it to be in a different place. 

Vulcan was then 'found' by Lescarbault using a crude telescope. This was quickly debunked by Liais using a better telescope in the same period. 

This proves that the real culprit was merely the inaccurate detection equipment. 

In 1915, Einstein entered the fray and absurdly proposed that spacetime was curved and that this curvature was causing Mercury to be not present where Newton predicted it to be.

The genius of his scam was a bunch of equations that injected the speed of light usually into the divisor to clean up the anomalies in the numerator (which often has the mass or energy variables). 

This is because Einstein lived at a time where detection equipment got better -- lenses were larger, mirrors had better silvering. These led to accurate measurements, including those for the speed of light which is the medium used to get the mass observations in the first place.

This is why his equations 'fix' the discrepancies in the Newtonian equations. They really do not say anything new about the universe, but merely describe the accuracy of modern detection equipment. 

For example, LIGO uses light and so General Relativity works very well on it. 

And so the 'tests' of General Relativity are merely tests of equipment, whether they be falling objects in fast-moving modern satellites, or pulsar measurements by modern radio telescopes.

This is why Tesla says that it is just a superficial useless theory, like a beggar with rich clothes.
So when you see an article: "Relativity passes test again!" It really means: "The equipment works!" 

It is used by physicists to pat themselves on the back to justify the spending of grant money on useless projects. 

As such, the beggar Theory of Relativity cannot describe how gravity is created. This is why it cannot explain dark matter nor dark energy, much less harness them for practical use.

## The Solution

Tesla was unable to realize his global energy transmission invention because he didn't know vortices andnn was even deficient in the .


To actually understand and use dark energy and dark matter, we go back to the real kings, as the theory of aethereal vortices from Descartes (for dynamics) and the theory of archetypes by Kepler (for classification). 

These can be used to create algorithms on the fly (instead of static Newtonian or Einsteinian equations) to manipulate gravity within the ever-changing spacetime.
