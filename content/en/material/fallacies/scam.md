A sophistry is a half-truth, or a fallacy that has some bits of relative truths in it to make it seem true.  

Fallacies naturally come from the limited abilities of humans. This is imposed by Nature itself:

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Meditations, Part 1" >}} 
I shall suppose that some malicious, powerful, cunning demon has done all to deceive me. I shall think that the sky, air, earth, shapes, and all external things are dreams that the demon has contrived as traps for my judgment. Like a prisoner who dreams that he is free, my laziness starts to suspect that my reality is merely a dream. It wants to go on dreaming rather than waking up. I fear being shaken out of my dream because I am afraid to realize the prison that I am in
{{< /q >}}


This is why all systems of knowledge created by humans have some fallacies in it:

Science | Fallacy | Problems Caused
--- | --- | ---
Economics | Money and Profit Maximization | Economic crises, Poverty, Inequality
Physics | Gravity comes from Matter | No anti gravity, teleportation, free energy
Western Medicine | Treating Symptom or Effect instead of Cause | Diseases recur and side effects created
Sociology | Differences in Culture, Language | War, Nationalism, Terrorism, Disputes
Evolution Theory | Survival of the Fittest | Nazism, Racism, Exploitation of the Weak
Psychology | Consciousness Comes From Brain | Ineffective Treatments that cause side effects


## The Sophistries in the Sciences

The Indians, through the Vedas, were the first ones to discover the illusion of reality -- the physical universe was itself false. This led them to have a culture of renouncing the false world and chasing the Truth.

However, there are many who want to favor the illusion. Such people were called Sophists in ancient Greece.

{{< q a="Foreigner" c="The Sophist" >}}
The Sophist has a sort of conjectural or apparent knowledge, which is not the truth.
{{< /q >}}


Sophistries exploit the limitation of humans to know the truth behind phenomena. 


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments" >}}
It has been said that in paying the interest of the public debt, it is the right hand which pays the left and the money does not go out of the country. The nation is not a tiny bit poorer. **This is based in the sophistry of the mercantile system.** It supposes that the whole public debt is because of the people, which is not true.
{{< /q >}}


Their most common technique is to **exploit the ambiguity of words**. This is the same tactic used by lawmakers to insert loopholes into laws that they will then exploit and profit from. 

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments" >}}
Money in common language frequently signifies wealth. This **ambiguity of expression** has rendered this popular notion so familiar to us. Even they who are convinced of its absurdity are very apt to forget their own principles.
{{< /q >}}

> Sophists exploit the ambiguity of words

<!-- Dr. Mandeville places vanity as the source of all virtuous actions. His sophistry is really covered by the ambiguity of language. We only give names to disagreeable feelings. In normal times, we overlook our feelings and do not name them at all. -->


<!-- In some of these, the sophistry is hidden by abstruse language.  -->

Nowadays, we use the word 'scam' instead of sophistry. 

In the case above, the scam is the financial sector equating money with wealth. They use this to push governments to get more money-loans under the pretence that it will provide employment and therefore wealth to the people, when it really just provides employment and wealth to the financial system.  


Unlike the Dunning-Kruger effect which is just a miscalculation of one's abilities, Sophists have mastery and push their scam with the ill intent of self-gain. 

They therefore have 3 components:

1. Desire of self-gain
2. Exploit the limitation of others
3. Use ambiguity as cover

These 3 are all part of the Negative Force or Yin in Taoism or Shakti in Hinduism.


## The FTX Scam

A very recent large scam was the blockchain company FTX which really was a ponzi scheme. Its mechanism is the ignorance of people on how blockchain works.

The scammer, Sam Bankman-Fried, then exploits this by claiming to be an expert. His mastery allows FTX to earn better than other crypto companies. Ignorant people then praise him as a genius. 

But since his scam goes against Nature, it will eventually be discovered, and karma will be imposed. 

Here, the time factor exposed the FTX scam, just as public debt and too-big-to-fail finance implodes after some time. This is because the time Element is right below the aether. 


<!-- ### Newton is a Slight Mistake, Not a Scam
We do not regard Newton as a scammer because he properly attributed the cause of gravity to the "Spirit of Lord God". 

This is consistent with the Indians saying that all the mechanism for the universe, and the universe itself, is from God as Brahma. 

q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica, Book 3 Scholium" >}}
This most beautiful system can only come from an intelligent and powerful Being.. I call Him Lord God. A Spirit pervades and lies hidden in all gross bodies. Its action and force causes the particles of bodies to mutually attract one another.. My work can lay the foundation to discover how this Spirit operates.
/q >}}

This Spirit is the same as the Cartesian aether or substance of Spinoza that creates the vast universe. 

q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics, Part 1, Prop 11" >}}
God, or substance, consisting of infinite attributes, of which each expresses eternal and infinite essentiality, necessarily exists
/q >}} -->



## The Einstein Scam: Simultaneity and the Constant Speed of Light

 <!-- of Time and Using Light to Glue Separate Times -->

Einstein's scam began in 1905 when he pushed the concept of **simultaneity of time**. 

{{< q a="Einstein" >}}
We test simultaneity by putting an observer in the middle `M` between `A` and `B`. He as two mirrors inclined at 90Â° to let him see both `A` and `B` at the same time. If he sees both flashes at the same time, then they are simultaneous. You object by saying that "time" would be measured by light, but the speed of light is measured by time. You would say this is **reasoning in a circle** and therefore, simultaneity has absolutely nothing to do with light. I answer that this is only used for us to make empirical decisions.
{{< /q >}}

Einstein shows that he is aware of the scam, as "reasoning in a circle". Yet he continues with it anyway so that he can use his scam to measure things i.e. "make empirical decisions".

This mechanism of this scam is to use the ambiguity of the word 'time' which is a mental concept, not a physical one. 

**It is because humans measure time so often and most often with physical means that most people think it is a physical concept.**

So the Einstein scam has 2 parts:

1. Simultaneity of Time -- this uses physical events to measure mental time
2. The Constant Speed of Light -- this uses the constancy as a measuring rod to glue the time of separate events


We will talk only about Simultaneity here. The constant speed of light fallacy is discussed in Superluminal motion.


## The Fallacy of the Simultaneity of Time

This uses physical events to measure the passage of time in the mind, then **objectively comparing** them to each other.

{{< q a="Einstein" c="On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies" >}}
An observer at point A with a watch can determine the time values of events near A by finding the watch time which is simultaneous with those events. Likewise, an observer at point B with the same watch can determine the time values of events near B by finding the watch time which is simultaneous with those events. But Event A will take Time A, and Event B will take Time B. 
{{< /q >}}


In reality, time is subjective and not objective. The fallacy of objective or 'simultaneous' time is seen:
- in jobs where older people are supposed to be more skilled than younger people
- in healthcare where older people are supposed to have worse health than young people
- in age ranges where old people are supposed to be earning higher than young people


The subjectivity of time was common sense knowledge before Einstein. This is why no one was dumb enough to make it objective or simultaneous.

{{< q a="Henri Poincare" c="The Measure of Time" >}}
We have not a direct intuition of the equality of 2 intervals of time. The persons who believe they possess this intuition are dupes of an illusion. What do I mean when I say, from 12 noon to 1 pm, the same time passes as from 2 pm to 3 pm? The least reflection shows that by itself it has no meaning at all. It will only have the meaning that I give to it, making it arbitrary.
{{< /q >}}


### The Precision of Light

Of the 5 Elements, the fire element, as electromagnetism, is the most accurate because fire element particles are small yet have consistent properties.

This makes it the ideal standard for the simultaneity or objectivity of subjective time. 

This fallacy is why physicists say that light "experiences" no time, as if light were alive!

This is also why **Relativity works very well in measuring things** even if it throws away causation altogether. A stretched out light wave is far more precise and consistent than using a string of sand particles as a measure.

{{< q a="Professor Dr. P. F. Linke" c="100 Authors Against Einstein" >}}
In the building of a physics in this way, Relativity provides evidence of its feasibility. The task of research is the establishment of the truth. The only question is **whether this feasibility was achieved at the expense of the truth**. It is an open secret that thinking about the categorical foundations of Relativity actually leads to logical difficulties. 
{{< /q >}}

 <!-- following non-solutions by General Relativity by making the following more precise: -->

This has led to the precise measuring of:
- gravitational lensing
- precession of Mercury
- weak equivalence principle of 2 objects falling at the same speed in a vacuum
- global positioning satellites

{{< i s="/photos/objects/gps.jpg" a="GPS" c="In Cartesian Physics, GPS gets its speed from the space particles going around the Earth, and not any absurd warping." >}}


## It's a Trap!

For some weird reason, physicists feel that the higher precision of General Relativity makes it better than Newtonian Mechanics, when all it does is to dig Physics into a deeper hole. 

This is similar to a blockchain scam where you can precisely mine a lot of cryptocurrency that are essentially worthless. Having billions of scam coins makes you feel richer even if in reality, you are poorer because of the wasted electricity. 

By making so many theories based on Relativity, Physics thinks it's making huge progress when in fact is really just staying more stuck at zero, as proven by the failures of:
- Supersymmetry
- String Theory
- Loop Quantum Gravity

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/einstein.jpg" a="Einstein" c="David Hume's system of critical thinking involves chasing the train of ideas to find the origin idea" >}}

This is the exact same fallacy that afflicts artificial intelligence (AI). Tech companies wrongly believe that throwing more energy and CPU into AI will magically make it sentient or naturally intelligent. They do not know that it is the aether, not electromagnetism, that is key to make AI sentient.

 <!-- so that your 1 coin today will be 1,000 coins next week a whopping 99,900% increase. But the real value is the same zero. In fact, the real value to Nature is negative because of the waste of electricity, and of your wasted time and effort to mine a lot of nothing.  non-solution -->

Relativity is a false theory because it does not explain:
- why masses fall
  - Matter being attracted by matter is debunked by the non-existence of dark matter
- why light is limited to `c`


All the effort of unifying quantum mechanics with Relativity have failed, because Nature never bends Herself to human scams. 

It would have been better for physicists to sleep for 100 years achieving nothing than waste so much time and effort achieving the same nothing. This is because like the blockchain example, the wasted effort is actually a negative. It follows that the funding for the Large Hadron Collider, for example, is really a loss to society since the Higgs boson is totally useless.


<!-- Lorentz and Poincare were wise to keep time psychological, avoiding the temptation to use physical light as the basis for psychological time:

Poincare created the first Relativity theory, but never won a Nobel Prize because he didn't scam people. -->


## Solution: Define Time Properly

<!-- Time is Mental, Not Physical -->

The Fallacy of Simultaneity prospers because humans have not properly defined time. 

To fix this, we define:
- timespan as the cognitive gap between perceptions
- time as the cognitive gap between perceptions in general

This will firmly establish time as a metaphysical or mental object.

The most accurate measure of time is aethereal **idea**, and not light. 

You can close your eyes and cover your ears and still be able to count mental time. 

The use of idea as a universal measure for time also solves the measurement problem in Quantum Mechanics.

Therefore, idea and the aether (as substance of idea)  unites both Classical and Quantum Mechanics, while totally flushing Einstein's scam Relativity down the toilet. 

In the next part, we explain the fallacy of the constant speed of light which will lead to the causal mechanism as the aether.

This will free Physics and allow the development of technologies for levitation and faster-than-light travel, as teleportation.

<!-- The fallacy of simultaneity is caused by us measuring mental time with material tools such as:
- the ticking of the clock
- the rotation of the Earth

This makes us think that time is physical even if it is arbitrary. This is proven by:
- timezones 
- countries having different system for years such as 2025 (years from Jesus' birth) being Reiwa Year 7 in Japan (years from coronation of Naruhito)

Einstein then goes for this fallacy fully by using the speed of light as the universal 'tick' by unifying physical time with physical space, trapping it in a 'Minkowski' space. -->



<!-- To a shallow mind, this constancy and invariance makes it an ideal measuring rod or timer.  -->
<!-- But the big problem is that time and space are mental, and not physical, measures.  -->


<!-- ### 2. Using Light Invariance to Glue the subjective times from different locations

This is the main fallacy that destroys the subjectivity of time to make it objective. 

This is best seen in the fallacy of Superluminal Motion. 


## Superluminal Motion

<!-- > All Relativity can do is to measure things. Relativity is useful when you need some accuracy in timekeeping, such as in GPS.But that's it. 

All successful tests of Relativity are just measurements using light or electromagnetism. It doesn't even allow you to move anything. 

Through Einstein, Physics gets that German precision in timekeeping, **but loses how Nature actually works**. 

This is similar to the blockchain scam where you can mine worthless coins so that your 1 coin today will be 1,000 coins next week a whopping 99,900% increase. But the real value is the same zero. In fact, the real value to Nature is negative because of the waste of electricity, and of your wasted time and effort to mine a lot of nothing.

In reality, the invention of Relativity is like the invention of a sundial. It makes timekeeping more accurate, but does not explain why the sun goes around the sky. Similarly, Relativity cannot explain why light is limited to 300,000 kilometers per second.

{{< i s="/photos/objects/clock.jpg" a="Sundial" c="A sundial does not explain why the sun goes around the sky. The notches provide more timekeeping accuracy just as the metric tensor of Relativity does" >}} -->


<!-- Our other post explains the [other side of the fallacy of Relativity](/material/fallacies/simultaniety/), as using the invariance of light to glue disparate times. -->


<!-- **It does not reveal and hidden properties that can be used to create new technology**. This is because Einstein never explained why light has the speed of `c`, because he didn't know why. 

Cartesian Physics explains that the speed of light is from the constriction of the aether onto spacetime. This leads to our concept of spacetime slices which replace the scam metric tensor and can be the basis for new technologies.  -->
