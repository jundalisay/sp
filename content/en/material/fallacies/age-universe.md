Physicists and astronomers were surprised that the James Webb Telescope revealed [new facts about the universe:](https://webbtelescope.org/files/live/sites/webb/files/home/webb-science/early-highlights/_documents/2022-061-jades/JADES_CurtisLake.pdf)

1. The universe was spread out more evenly than expected
2. The oldest galaxies were smaller compared to our younger Milky Way and were [more than expected](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2311963120)

<!-- surprisingly many galaxies, galaxies that are surprisingly smooth, surprisingly small and surprisingly old. -->

To this we add earlier surprises from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data:

3. Gravitational waves did not exist in the CMB
4. The temperature differences in the CMB did not have much variety

The cause of these surprises was the false materialist belief called **The Big Bang Theory** which says that the universe began as a mass of singularity that exploded to create spacetime and the current galaxies. 

Such a theory would lead to the following predictions:
- There should be more galaxies at a certain region of the universe compared to others
- Old galaxies should be bigger than new ones
- Gravitational waves should be present because there was a huge singularity that created ripples in the fabric of space
- There should be more temperature differences because of the expansion

Such assumptions were destroyed by the findings of:
- the **James Webb Space Telescope** which detected galaxies at the early universe being large instead of small
- the **Planck satellite** which detected no gravitational waves in the CMB
- **DESI** detecting variations in the acceleration of the expansion of space


## The Cause of the Error: The Religion of Physics

The corrupted assumptions of Physics, just like the corrupted ones of Economics, create theoretical absurdities that lead to real problems.

- The corrruption of Economics is the obsession with money
- The corrruption of Physics is the obsession with visible things

Physics is unable to process invisible things like spirit and mind, calling them pseudo-science. This forces them into simplistic theories that are based on visible effects instead of invisible causes:

- The universe needing to have a starting day is an idea from the Bible, proposed by the priest Lemaitre as the hypothesis of the primeval atom

{{< q a="Georges Lemaitre" c="The Primeval Atom">}}
In this first phase of the expansion of space, starting asymptotically with a zero radius, we have particles of enormous velocities immersed in radiation.

- The force of gravity being based on matter is from Newton's ignorance on the cause of gravity

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica, Book 1, Definitions" >}}
The quantities of these centripetal forces can be called accelerative, motive, absolute.. I do not bother to know where such an absolute force come from. I just want to give them a mathematical form.
{{< /q >}}

These dogmas combined leads to the Big Bang theory which has been disproven by the recent data.


## The Solution: A Sponge Universe

In 1644, Descartes published his expansion theory with an analogy of a sponge:

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 2, Article " >}}
A sponge full of water is different from a dry sponge because the wet sponge has wider pores. This makes its body more diffused over a larger physical space. But this does not mean that each sponge-particle has greater metaphysical space when wet than when dry. 
{{< /q >}}


This matches the current expansion of the universe which Physics compares to a balloon expanding.

{{< youtube ZvcdkNKxxoQ >}}

However, we stick to a sponge analogy because the balloon analogy causes matter to expand as well. 

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/space.jpg" a="Sponge" >}}


An expanding sponge keeps the matter of the sponge at the same density while matching the look of the cosmic web.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/balloon.jpg" a="Sponge" >}}

This also emphasizes the liquid property of space which manifests as:
- gravitational waves as proven by LIGO
- acoustic bubbles as proven by DESI as baryonic acoustic oscillations

The sponge universe has always existed and does not have a material start. 


## Dark Energy

Instead of a material singularity, the matter in the universe comes from the energy of space. This is proven by quarks that emerge out of space as a result of excessive imposition of energy.

The expansion is caused by 'dark energy' which comes from all over space, as proven by baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs), as bubble which pop up everywhere.

## The CMB as External Galaxies in an Expanding Infinite Universe

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the radiation from galaxies that are beyond our observable universe. These come from their material heat, and not from the heat of a 'Big Bang'. 

This means that those very distant galaxies are not ancient, but rather just very distant. This is why Jamwes Webb saw large galaxies at the farthest distances that it could detect.

All of these point to the substance called the **aetherspace** which binds the cosmic web and creating the expansion of space. This aetherspace is called Gravity A by Bob Lazar, as opposed to Gravity B. 

This aetherspace facilitates both large-scale phenomena as well as quantum effects, unifying Classical and Quantum Mechanics.
