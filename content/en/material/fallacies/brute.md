On December 5, 2022, the National Ignition Facility in the US, a laser fusion reactor, was able to create more energy via nuclear fusion than they put in.

However, it was not practical nuclear fusion as it could not be sustained. The energy produced was not reused to continue the fusion reactions. 

The same problem afflicted other fusion reactors. 

Currently, the reactions are sustained only for around 100 seconds. Imagine powering a city only for 100 seconds and then leaving it dark again -- it would be a useless kind of power.


## Brute Force Thinking

The current brute force thinking that plagues Physics is also evident in the Large Hadron Collider where scientists are pushing for an super expensive Future Circular Collider with massive energy at 100 TeV, much more than that of the Large Hadron Collider at 13.6 TeV.

However, the cost is also much larger at around $27 billion compared to the $4.75 billion spent for the Large Hadron Collider.

Despite the huge cost and energy output used in their fusion reactors and particle colliders, the benefit to science and humanity have been zero. 

This is because both their mechanisms use electromagnetism instead of the aether which controls spacetime. 
- Both the National Ignition Facility and Japan's tokamak use Electromagnetism to start and sustain fusion reactions. 

The big problem is that electromagnetism is inferior to the aether.

While pure energy and brute force are common in dealing with Electromagnetism, precision and sophistication are common in dealing with Spacetime.

This is seen in the Platonic shapes where the geometry of abstract ideas are essential in explaining the dynamics of real things. 

It follows that the correct way to harness fusion is to create artificial gravity. 

This is done naturally by stars through their central vortex that compresses and holds the fusion reactions.

But physicists don't know how to make artificial gravity because they don't know how gravity works in the first place. 

They don't know how gravity works because they limit their science to visible physical perceptions that are objective in nature, when the causal mechanism of the aether is invisible and subjective.


## The Subtle, Refined Approach

Physics will only be able to harness fusion if physicists evolve out of the brute force approach into the subtle and refined one. 

This requires increasing the sensitivity of the heart since the heart chakra is the main detector for the aether, just as the eyes are the detector for light.

<!-- These can also be employed to harness energy in two ways:  

1. By tapping into the perpetual division of spacetime particles from the Negative Force that manifests as the accelerated expansion of space. 

This is like a windmill tapping the energy from the wind and is free energy.


2. By extracting the energy from the atomic reactions of the material layer through quantum tunneling. 

This requires an input, such as hydrogen and is therefore non-free energy. However, it extracts more energy in a shorter time.

Physicists are going for the second approach after learning how to extract atomic energy in the 1940's through nuclear fission reactions, as a consequence of atomic theory. However, fission is limited and dangerous. This led physicists to go for fusion which is supposed to be clean and safe. 

It does not apply to the upper two layers of the spatial or aethereal, where crudity is replaced by precision and sophistication. The technological designs for the lower three layers are so simplistic:
- the general design of combustion-based rockets is based on a simple tube
- all air-based airplanes are a tubes with two wings 

The Spatial (gravitational layer) is different because it is based on points, and points connected with other points lead to geometries. These are then manipulated by the upper aethereal layer which is based on waves, examples of which are sounds and waves of feelings. --> 

<!-- A round reactor uses a single qost (monad). This outputs less energy, but is useful for compact vehicles. 

A linear reactor uses two or more qosts (duads, etc). This outputs much more energy, and is useful for very large vehicles. -->

<!-- Of the current fusion designs, this is what the twisty stellarator is trying to do. However, it still needs to be overhauled as to create a vortex which will create gravity which will confine it and make it sustainable. This will allow it to be reduced in size as to be able to fit large vehicles. This vortex-stellarator can then assume either the round or linear shape:

1. The round twisty reactor is the compact version, useful for small vehicles
2. The linear twisty version is for large vehicles -->
