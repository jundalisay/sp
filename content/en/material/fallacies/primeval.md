In 1931 Georges Lemaitre published his Primeval Atom theory which said that the universe began as an atom.

He formed his theory in the 1910s with its basis being the Second Law of Thermodynamics which was then proven by quantum theory of the Bohr model.

The advances in radioactivity that eventually led to fission then urged him to publish it as being plausible.

It theorized that the universe began as a primeval atom that disintegrated and then expanded via Friedmann's equations to form nebulae.

The big problem began when recent data came in, attacking the theory from all sides. 

1. DESI showed that the expansion from the Big Bang was not fixed, meaning the expansion could not be from an atomic explosion. 

No one ever saw the shockwaves from a nuclear bomb to speed up then slow down then speed up in arbitrary distances. 

2. James Webb saw large galaxies near the 'start' of the Big Bang. 

Yet no one ever saw any galaxy created instantly while others are created slowly.

3. The Planck Satellite shows that the Earth was center of the CMB.

Yet no sane person would ever propose that the core of the earth or the sun was the corpse of the primeval atom.

4. Lastly, LIGO was not able to detect gravitational waves in the CMB.

A causal big bang would have sent even traces of shockwaves in the earliest part of the universe. But none were found.

It is true that cosmic radiation comes from material radiation. But that radiation comes from a huge amount of galaxies present beyond the observable universe, not from a primeval atom.

It is true that the universe is expanding, but that expansion is from dynamic space itself as evidenced by the bubbles of acoustic oscillations. 

This points to an infinite universe that had no beginning in a dynamic space, expanding just as the ocean has variable high tides.


There has been no evidence for either the primeval atom nor wormholes. Instead, the evidence points to acoustic oscillations (DESI), infinite galaxies (James Webb), and geocentric subjective universe (Planck Satellite). 

These are accounted for by the Physics of Descartes and George Berekeley, and not by that of Newton nor Einstein. 

We hope to give relief to the physicists who have been stressing over the Hubble Tension for so many years, spending billions to launch new satellites and pouring effort to make new measurements or verifications without advancing their knowledge of Nature.

We replace the tension with a free flowing peace of an infinite universe that grows in subtle bubbles instead of a violent big bang from the pressure of dogma.

We should listen to how Nature explains Herself, instead of imposing what we want on It.
