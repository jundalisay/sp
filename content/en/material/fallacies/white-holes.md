Recently, some [science websites](https://www.space.com/could-white-holes-exist-space-mysteries) have asked why White Holes are never found even if they are predicted by General Relativity. 


We answer that this is because white holes, just like worm holes, are based on General Relativity which is false to begin with. 


## What are White Holes?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole) describes it as a hypothetical region of spacetime and singularity that cannot be entered from the outside, although energy, matter, light and information can escape from it.

Basically, it is a hypothetical black hole in reverse. Instead of sucking in light, it emits light from its singularity. 

The mechanism for the emission is the absurd idea of **time-reversal** wherein the Hawking radiation of a black hole becomes the emission of a white hole through its singularity.

So the cause of a white hole is time-reversal. But where did the silly idea of time-reversal come from?


## The Absurdity of Time-Reversal

To understand why physicists suddenly lost their common sense and started to think that time can go on reverse, we have to go back to before the **Michelson-Morley experiment** (MME).

Before MME, physicists thought that space was fixed. 

Morever, Fresnel and Young proved by experiment that light had wave properties as it moved through space.  So they imagined that there should be something in between space and light to give light those wave properties.

That somehing was the (Fresnel) aether. It should make light move at different speeds as it moved through empty space. 

But the MME proved that the speed of light was fixed at a maximum limmit. 

And so physicists discarded the idea of the (Fresnel) aether and thought that the whole aether idea was debunked.

Since light was fixed, then it was space that was not fixed and was the one with the wave properties as a wavy invariant fabric called spacetime. This was the General Relativity theory from the genius sophist Albert Einstein.

Since space was no longer fixed, then it meant time was also no longer fixed -- Physicists thought that this meant that time could move forward and backward. 

But in Cartesian Physics (which is one of the basis for Superphysics), time only moves forward since **time is the gap between perceptions**. 

We all notice that we have perceptions after perceptions -- these keep on adding to our experiences.
- We never experience a continuous forgetting process where we forget more and more of the present, as to make our past the present. 
- We never forget our current perception and only remember from 10 seconds ago, and then when we think of that 10 seconds, we never forget that and remember only our reality from 20 seconds ago. 

It would be like a mobile phone deleting its data continously until it reverts to a factory-state, and then even goes beyond that by deleting its own operating system in order to stop working. If that were the nature of the universe, then there would be no existence by now.

So clearly the reversal of time is absurd.

<!-- The reality is that the aether is not between space and light. Instead, the aether is behind space and space is behind light. In other words:
- spacetime limits light to 300,000 km/s
- aether limits spacetime to this current universe, making the other universes imperceptible -->

### The Entropy Excuse

Some smarter Physicists realize that white holes are impossible because they require entropy which is always supposed to move forward in time. 

In Cartesian Physics, heat is part of the electromagnetic family which also includes light. Since the Post-MME physicists put electromagnetism as superior to spacetime, then the inherent nature of entropy logically debunks the time reversal from General Relativity.  

A reverse entropy would mean that the universe shrinks back into a nothing-point, which is absurd since the expansion of the universe plainly debunks it. 

In response to this, Relativists (fans of Einstein) make another absurd proposition that entropy does not exist. 

This is proof of Einstein's sophistry -- a lie is covered up by another lie. 


### The Solution

The whole cause of the problem was Einstein's Simultaneity of Time scam wherein light (a physical entity) was used as the basis of time (a purely mental entity). 

We erase everything Einstein and overhaul Newton to explain that gravity comes from the aether, not from matter. 

This makes white holes and worm holes unnecessary. 

The matter and information sucked in by a black hole (aethereal space vortex) get converted into the aetherspace inside the black hole. 

This is then emmitted back into the universe at another place as galaxy formation. This conserves matter and energy, removing any information paradox.
