The Big Bang is a consequence of religious thinking, from a priest named Lemaitre, that has corrupted Physics. 

The Catholic religion imposes a belief that the universe had a genesis or a start date. 

In reality, this start date is really the arrival of the Anunnaki who really did create humans via genetic manipulation of Homo Erectus. 

Lemaitre combined the expansion of the universe and the newly discovered phenomenon of atomic decay to justify a genesis:

{{< q a="Georges Lemaitre" c="The Primeval Atom">}}
My hypothesis uses the theory of relativity as the cosmological constant and the cosmic repulsion which results.. The entire universe existed as an atomic nucleus which filled elliptical space of convenient radius in a uniform manner.
{{< /q >}}



Because of the persisting need for a start date for the universe, Lemaitre's mind created the idea of an atom expanding to create the universe. This idea was seemingly validated after the cosmic microwave background was discovered which showed the heat of the universe matching a blackbody.

This then equated spatial distance to going back in time i.e. farther distances meant earlier universe. 

This was easily debunked when James Webb found distant galaxies already formed. 

<!-- But instead of throwing away the Big Bang and Lambda CDM, physicists chose to save it and instead complicate things by theorizing new physics for the early universe.  -->


<!-- Note that in Einstein's original theory, the universe was eternal as the expansion could just 

Einstein's sophistical General Relativity which imposes that the speed of light, and consequently information, travels at 300,000 kilometers per second. 

Therefore, the light from an object 600,000 kilometers away is 2 seconds old, different from its current light. 

This means that the light from very distant galaxies is billions of years old, closer to the age of the universe itself. That light would be from galaxies that are very young which means that they cannot possibly be fully developed. 

**Yet that's exactly what James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) shows.**

For example, JWST shows galaxy "Gz9p3" having the following properties:
- a Lyman break of 9.35. This shows that it is very far (and therefore very young to modern Physics)
- MUV of −21.66. This shows that it is very bright and massive (a quality of older galaxies)

To address this anomaly, researchers advise a revision of the star formation model (e.g. speed up star formation from the early universe), instead of the more common sense solution of **throwing away both ΛCDM cosmology and General Relativity**. Both CDM and Relativity are Einstein monstrosities that turn Nature upside down. 


## The Solution: Cartesian 5 Elements

The proper solution is Rene Descartes' 5 Elements model. This model divides the labor between the 5 Elements:

1. Aether
2. Spacetime
3. Light
4. Weak
5. Strong Force

These work together to create reality. 

An analogy for the JWST findings is a bullet train on train tracks on ground. 

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/jwst.jpg" alt="Train on tracks" cap="Spacetime 'redshifts' light just as the ground can bend tracks" >}}

- The ground represents spacetime
- The tracks are lightwaves that travel through spacetime 
- The train is the aethereal information conveyed by those waves
- The speed of light is the rate of laying tracks. 
  - On good ground, the rate is 300 meters per work shift. On bad ground, it might be 100. On better ground, it might be 600.

Once the tracks have connected to both stations (star and telescope), then the bullet train travels instantly (or at least so much faster than the track-laying speed) between both ends.

In fact, Descartes extends this motion of the aether as it goes from the telescope into our eyes, brain, and lastly into the aethereal soul that experiences it. 

This is why Descartes said that the speed of light was instant. He really meant the aether that travelled through light. 

This means that the distant galaxies that JWST observes are close to their current age instead of being billions of years old. This explains why they are already so massive and bright. (This also explains why entangled particles can teleport instantly.) 


### Matches the CMB as well

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/sponge.jpg" a="CMB" >}}

The findings of the JWST matches findings of the CMB in the sense that the closer area of the universe, as opposed to the red shift which is the distant areas.
- This is because heat particles are more limited than light particles (photons)
- The "anisotropies" are the galaxy clusters beyond the milky way
- The blackbody spectrum of the CMB is from the dark energy (evidenced by lensing) in the nearby universe that operates between clusters
- The CMB does not match the cosmic web because of the difference between light and heat particles. 

The CMB, as a blackbody spectrum, proves that dark energy is the aetherspace which is the same in essence as the gluon field which Bob Lazar calls Gravity A waves. 

This means that research should be put on the gluon field. The problem is that physicists smash atoms instead of probing or interrogating them because of the wrong belief that gravity comes **FROM** matter instead of **THROUGH** it.




The corrupted assumptions of Physics, just like the corrupted ones of Economics, create theoretical absurdities that lead to real problems.

- The corrruption of Economics is the obsession with money
- The corrruption of Physics is the obsession with visible things

Physics is unable to process invisible things like spirit and mind, calling them pseudo-science. This forces them into simplistic theories that are based on visible effects instead of invisible causes:

- The universe needing to have a starting day is an idea from the Bible, proposed by the priest Lemaitre as the hypothesis of the primeval atom

{{< q a="Georges Lemaitre" c="The Primeval Atom">}}
In this first phase of the expansion of space, starting asymptotically with a zero radius, we have particles of enormous velocities immersed in radiation.
{{< /q >}}

- The force of gravity being based on matter is from Newton's ignorance on the cause of gravity

{{< q a="Newton" c="Principia Mathematica, Book 1, Definitions" >}}
The quantities of these centripetal forces can be called accelerative, motive, absolute.. I do not bother to know where such an absolute force come from. I just want to give them a mathematical form.
{{< /q >}}

These dogmas combined leads to the Big Bang theory which has been disproven by the recent data.


## The Solution: A Sponge Universe

In 1644, Descartes published his expansion theory with an analogy of a sponge:

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 2, Article " >}}
A sponge full of water is different from a dry sponge because the wet sponge has wider pores. This makes its body more diffused over a larger physical space. But this does not mean that each sponge-particle has greater metaphysical space when wet than when dry. 
{{< /q >}}


This matches the current expansion of the universe which Physics compares to a balloon expanding.

{{< youtube ZvcdkNKxxoQ >}}

However, we stick to a sponge analogy because the balloon analogy causes matter to expand as well. 

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/space.jpg" a="Sponge" >}}


An expanding sponge keeps the matter of the sponge at the same density while matching the look of the cosmic web.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/balloon.jpg" a="Sponge" >}}

This also emphasizes the liquid property of space which manifests as:
- gravitational waves as proven by LIGO
- acoustic bubbles as proven by DESI as baryonic acoustic oscillations

The sponge universe has always existed and does not have a material start. 


## Dark Energy

Instead of a material singularity, the matter in the universe comes from the energy of space. This is proven by quarks that emerge out of space as a result of excessive imposition of energy.

The expansion is caused by 'dark energy' which we call the aetherspace which binds spacetime. 
- These are bubbles that pop up everywhere and manifests as baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs).  
- Bob Lazar calls them as Gravity-A waves

<!-- All of these point to the substance called the **aetherspace** which binds the cosmic web and creating the expansion of space. This aetherspace is called Gravity A by Bob Lazar, as opposed to Gravity B.  -->

This aetherspace facilitates both large-scale phenomena as well as quantum effects, unifying Classical and Quantum Mechanics.


{{< i s="/photos/physics/bao.jpg" a="BAOs" >}}


## The CMB as local heat of cluster/s

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the radiation from galaxies within or near our galactic cluster. This is because heat particles have a shorter range than light particles because they are larger. 

The Hubble Tension is the difference in the expansion speed of the universe measured through red shift at 73 kilometers per second per megaparsec (measured by James Webb) and through the CMB at 67 (measured by Planck Satellite). 

This matches the findings of DESI that shows expansion is faster in the distant universe which Physics wrongly interprets as going back in time!

This is further consistent with the James Webb Space Telescope that found very distant galaxies already well-formed. This proves that those very distant galaxies are not ancient, but rather just very distant.



The cause of these surprises was the false materialist belief called the [Big Bang Theory](/material/fallacies/big-bang) which says that the universe began as a primeval atom or singularity that exploded to create spacetime and the current galaxies. 

Such a theory would lead to the following predictions:
- There should be more galaxies at a certain region of the universe compared to others
- Old galaxies should be bigger than new ones
- Gravitational waves should be present because there was a huge singularity that created ripples in the fabric of space
- There should be more temperature differences because of the expansion

Such assumptions were destroyed by the findings of:
- the **James Webb Space Telescope** which detected galaxies at the early universe being large instead of small
- the **Planck satellite** which detected no gravitational waves in the CMB
- **DESI** detecting variations in the acceleration of the expansion of space
