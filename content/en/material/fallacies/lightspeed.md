A [previous post](/material/fallacies/scam) explained that the Einstein scam called Relativity has 2 parts:

## Fallacy 1: The Simultaneity of Time

This forces subjective mental time to be objective by using light as the measuring rod because of its precision. 

{{< q a="Einstein" c="On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies" >}}
An observer at point A with a watch can determine the time values of events near A by finding the watch time which is simultaneous with those events. 
{{< /q >}}

This corrupts Physics by sacrificing the aether just to enshrine electromagnetism. This corruption seen nowadays in:
- tech companies adding more and more  energy and CPU to artificial intelligence (AI) with the wrong belief that more energy will magically turn AI into real intelligence
- the Hubble Tension and Axis of Evil, as the CMB being believed to have come from the Big Bang instead of the local aetherspace
- physcists theorizing warp drives that will never become a reality

{{< q a="Alcubierre" c="The Warp Drive">}}
Exotic matter will be needed to generate such a distortion of spacetime
{{< /q >}}


<!-- ## Fallacy 1: The Simultaneity of Time

This fallacy converts mental (metaphysical) time into a physical object through the simultaneity of 2 physical events.
This fallacy is quite common in everday life that it not so harmless. 
For example, a 60 year old man is "older" than a 30 year old because he has gone through more physical revolutions of the Earth than the younger one. 

But if the 60 year old man has youthful energy and takes care of his health, enjoys time with friends, and exercises and is destined to live up to 90 years old, then he is metaphysically younger (more dynamic) than the 30 year old who will soon die of heart attack from overwork.

So here, the physical age is a useless metric in comparing lifespan since age is really in the mind. -->

<!-- The correct measure of their elapsed time is to compare their aether content. 
The volume of the Positive aether of the 60 year old man is more than the 30 year old man and so the 30 year old man is will end his physical life sooner.  
 -->


## Fallacy 2: Using the Constancy of Lightspeed to Connect Subjective Simultaneity-events 

The first fallacy wrongly turned aethereal or mental time into an electromagnetic or physical time for precision purposes. 

But this second fallacy actually imposes the first fallacy onto the universe through the constant speed of light.

{{< q a="Einstein" c="On The Electrodynamics Of Moving Bodies" >}}
An observer at point `A` with a watch can determine the time values of events near `A` by finding the watch time which is simultaneous with those events. Likewise, an observer at point `B` with a watch can determine the time values of events near `B` by finding the watch-time which is simultaneous with those events. But Event `A` will take Time `A`. Event `B` will take Time `B`. **How can we define a common “time” for A and B?** This can be done by **defining “time” as the time required by light to travel from A to B being equal to the “time” that it requires to travel from B to A**. 
{{< /q >}}


<!-- This fallacy is unique to Einstein's Relativity because it  -->

This equates time with distance by capitalizing on:
- the invariant (subjective) nature of light
- light having a maximum constant speed

This is far more harmful than the simultaneity fallacy because it makes:
- distant galaxies older even if they are really just farther
- the light from the sun 8 minutes old as if light were a living organism that ages
- the eternal universe have an age


This fallacy is seen in:
- superluminal motion where light actually travels faster than the maximum speed, yet is mathematically coerced to stay within `c`
- Jamwes Webb Space Telescope showing very distant galaxies already well formed
- wormholes and whiteholes not being found, since the center of black holes are aether and not space


<!-- This fallacy wastes away research funding into trying to figure out the Hubble Tension or dark energy and look for dark matter when it should have been used to manipulate the aether to improve human lifespan (time aspect) or levitate things to get us off this planet (space aspect). -->


## Superluminal Motion Hacks

Physicists discard the evidence of light in quasars, pulsars, and nova going faster than light. They instead create math hacks to coerce the evidence into conforming with the Einstein fallacy.


### 1. Light Echo Hack

This is used to explain the faster than light movement by nova V838 Monocerotis.

This says that the light from nova is merely reflected off matter around the nova to give the illusion of light traveling faster than c. 

But this would only work if there multiple light sources that conspired or were arranged perfectly to shine light at a backdrop at a close sequence
- This is like light being turned on against a wall in a sequence.
- The 'illusion' is reflection instead of emission


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/echo.jpg" a="Echo" >}}


A light echo would only work if there were many stars emitting light and were exposed sequentially. In the case of V838 Monocerotis, the moving cloud would expose light in a sequential way.

If so, then the expansion should appear in different colors and intensities since the clouds are going through different paths of light. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/echo2.jpg" a="Echo" >}}


But the video clearly shows that the light is homogenous -- it comes from the same source which is likely the central star in the binary star system.

### 2. Relativistic Jets Hack

Physicists claim that M87 jets match Relativity when the actual evidence shows otherwise. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/m87.jpg" a="Echo" c="Observation is clearly different from theory" >}}


For example in the video below, they hack the observed speed of light by imposing on it Einstein's light cone (as `speed /(sin14 +(speed/c)cos14)`). 

This of course will reduce the speed to `0.97c`, arbitrarily converting it be within the speed of light dogma. But why hack it?

{{< youtube eAHPW026IjQ >}}

This absurdity is like a beauty contest that decrees that only white skinned people are beautiful. And so the black contestants must be "whitened" before they can join. 

Similarly, the speed of M87 light is 4x the max speed of light, so physicists apply some arbitrary equation in the form of Einstein's light cone, to coerce it back to the dogmatic and accepted speed of light. 

It is bending Nature to human norms. As a result, humans are unable to tap Nature for antigravity or faster than light travel.



## The Solution: Idea and the Aether 

We fix:
- the fallacy of simultaneity by using idea as the measuring rod for space and time
- the fallacy of the constant lightspeed by using the aether and aethereal vortices
