The previous posts explained how Modern Physics is based on Einstein's dogmas that have hampered Physics since 1905.

1. [The Simultaneity of Time](/material/fallacies/simultaniety/) wrongly makes mental time into a physical object
2. [Relativity](/material/fallacies/arrow-of-time/) makes time electromagnetic -- this is why physicists absurdly say that photons do not experience time, as if they were alive
3. [Quanta](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2CbtZVQjiLg) as packets of energy makes electromagnetism superior to aethereal vibrations

{{< i s="/photos/physics/messier87.jpg" a="Messier 87" c="Messier 87 gives in-your-face proof against Relativity's core assumption of the constant speed of light"  >}}

Einstein's scam Relativity is the reason why Modern Physics imposes a limiting dogma that nothing travels faster than light. 

This is because it cancelled the aether which is the mechanism behind time and therefore speed. This is because the aether is the substance of ideas, feelings, and the abstract mind or soul that has those ideas and feelings. Time is from change and change is from perception which is a mental activity. 

Idea is the unit of measure in the measeurement problem and so the aether fixes all of the biggest problems in Modern Physics.


## Bad Effects of Einstein's Fallacies: Backward Physics

But the Einstein dogma is imposed all throughout Modern Physics to create wacky theories to coerce Nature to conform to human dogma:


1. Early-Universe Physics for the Hubble Tension 

Einstein's quantization made heat the mechanism behind space. Since there is no aether, this makes the Cosmic Microwave Background and effect of matter, apparently validating Lemaitre's premieval material atom. But this goes against Nature, as proven by the Hubble Tension.

Instead of simply restoring the aether, physicists invent a hack as different physics for the early universe.


2. Quantum Gravity for the Cosmological Constant Problem

Einstein's Relativity makes space and time electromagnetic which negates the aether and its energy, as the zero point energy. 

Instead of simply destroying Relativity, physicists try to unify it with Quantum Mechanics leading to quantum gravity theories that are not testable. This is because they don't have a replacement for all of those theories because no one knows about Cartesian Physics.


3. Wormholes, Whiteholes, Hidden Variables not found 

Einstein's other predictions have been disproven or not found. Yet somehow people do not see this as a reason to discard his photo-electric effect, simultaneity, and relativity. 


4. Superluminal motion 

Evidence from quasars, pulsars, and nova shows that light travels faster than c. Yet such evidence is hacked to conform to dogma.





 <!-- fact that only white people win their contest becomes proof that only white people are beautiful. -->


## Decartes Solves Both With a Single Principle of Vortices

Instead of multiple hacks like light echo, light cones, shock waves, tachyons, etc, Descartes uses a single principle for all phenomena in outerspace -- spatial vortices. 

Both the expansion speed of the nova and the jets from quasars are governed by space particles which in turn are governed by the center vortex of the star or nova.

{{< youtube 8aRfCpIZKtw >}}

In fact, quasar jets disprove Einstein's Relativity and instead validate Descartes' rotating vortices which convert matter back to energy. This prevents the thermal death of the universe. 

This means that the total energy emited by qusars should match the total matter in galaxies. This means that many bright galaxies with jets are actually quasars. 

Instead of hacking phenomena to coerce them into a dogma, the actual relationships of vortices and variable light-speeds should be studied. 

This will then help us understand the properties of the aether which is in the center of all spatial vortices (callled singularity by physics).

This will then help develop levitation and teleportation technology much faster.

 ## Too Much Math is to Blame

Both Poincare and Sabine Hossenfelder blames the collapse of Physics to the dominance of mathematicians who are out of touch with reality.  

{{< q a="Henri Poincare" c="The Measure of Time" >}}
The mathematicians of the Berlin school have devoted themselves to constructing this continuous scale of irrational and fractional numbers using only the integer. The mathematical continuum from this point of view would be a pure creation of the mind in which experiment would have no part

## The Problem with Math

Math allows people to convert physical perceptions into variables which can then be transposed and manipulated by the whim. 

For example, in this video, Derek claims that he can turn 0.99999 to 1.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tRaq4aYPzCc?si=QFlHF0tTDoqlptSW&amp;start=264" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The fraud happens when he removes the 0.9999 from 9.9999 to convert the repeating decimal into a whole nuber just to prove his absurd claim.

In effect, he is able to equate 0.99999 to 1 by arbitrarily removing the repeating decimals by subtracting them.

These are Math 'Hacks' that disconnect the math from reality and is why hacked theories do not match reality -- because they arise from the whim of the mathematician or theorist.

Ideally, math should be used by engineering which always keeps the fidelity of the variables to their physical representations, as proven in experiments. Both Newton and Maxwell were strong at experimentation just as they were good at math.

But the people after Maxwell seemed to lack experimentation ability and instead pushed for wild theories. For example, Georges Lemaitre created the Big Bang theory just to match Physics with the Bible creation story. The Big Bang has been disproven by data from James Webb, DESI, and the Planck satellite.

Our experiments with Cartesian aether could be done with household equipment and gauge blocks. So there is no excuse for richer countries to have weak experimentation ability.

But mathematicians protect their intellectual position by implying that those who go against math are weak-minded.
- This is similar to how priests protected their dogma by implying that those who went against them were influenced by the Devil.


## The Solution

We correct Relativity by converting it to Cartesian Relationality. 

The 3 components of the Einstein scam are: 

1. His desire for Nobel Prize money which he gave to his wife who actually created Relativity
2. The fact that no one, even himself, knew the aether or 5th Element
3. Use of the ambiguity of time

We fix the simultaneity of time by having a moral paradigm:

1. Give credit to Descartes for explaining the 4 Elements
2. Explain how time works according to 3 Elements
3. Define time properly

We start by replacing "time" with "timespan" and the following Cartesian definitions:

Word | Definition
--- | ---
Timespan | The gap between 2 perceptions
Time | The gap between perceptions in general

Timespan can be divided into 3:

1. Mental timespan

This is true timespan, based on the Aether or 5th Element

2. Light timepan

This is light-years and light-speed used to measure very large distances. It is also the basis of relativistic timespan. This is the Fire Element. 

3. Material timespan

This timespan is the Matter or Earth Element, as springs and sand. 

These timespans are then within Newton's Absolute Time.

### Experiment 

Take a fast plane and go around the world with 3 clocks:

1. A mental clock 
2. An atomic clock
3. A sand clock

Compare the results with 3 clocks on the ground where you left and will arrive. They will show difference time discrepancy values. You then choose which one is feasible for your use-case. This is similar to the people in the International Space Station arbitrarily agreeing to use GMT 0 as their timezone.

### The Elements Restored

The demarcation of the 3 Elements re-separates the Conservation of Energy and Mass from the prison or confinement created by `E=mc^2`. 

No longer does one need a huge amount of energy to bypass spacetime and teleport or levitate to other locations. This matches non-locality of quantum mechanics. This exposes the nature of the aether which is arbitariness and non-sequentiality. 

More importantly, it restores the aether, via mental spacetime. You can now use this to impose on matter (3rd Element) to change its aetherspace configuration (since atoms are mostly empty space). 

This will then allow it to levitate or at least become lighter, as done by levitating Buddhist monks.

For material bodies, such as vehicles, this can be done by applying Maxwell's 4th Equation, which is about waves and energy, onto gravity. 
- Instead of manipulating charged particles to create magnetism, the aetherspace of the atom is manipulated to cancel gravity.
- This aetherspace is Bob Lazar's Gravity-A waves which are used by UFOs to levitate and teleport

{{< youtube 0dXvYASaIx4 >}}

Lorentz should have done this if he had only focused on the Huygens aether instead of the Fresnel aether. 

Had Cartesian Physics survived, people after Maxwell would have used waves to discover and manipulate the aetherspace to move things by action-at-a-distance.
