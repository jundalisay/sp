The previous posts explained how Modern Physics is based on Einstein's dogmas that have hampered Physics since 1905.

1. [The Simulataneity of Time](/material/fallacies/simultaniety/) wrongly makes mental time into a physical object
2. [Relativity](/material/fallacies/arrow-of-time/) makes time electromagnetic -- this is why physicists absurdly say that photons do not experience time, as if they were alive
3. [Quanta](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2CbtZVQjiLg) as packets of energy makes electromagnetism superior to aethereal vibrations

{{< i s="/photos/physics/messier87.jpg" a="Messier 87" c="Messier 87 gives in-your-face proof against Relativity's core assumption of the constant speed of light"  >}}

Einstein's scam Relativity is the reason why Modern Physics imposes a limiting dogma that nothing travels faster than light. 

This is because it cancelled the aether which is the mechanism behind time and therefore speed. 

This dogma is then imposed all throughout Modern Physics to create wacky theories to coerce Nature to conform to human dogma:


1. Early-Universe Physics for the Hubble Tension 

Einstein's quantization made heat the mechanism behind space. Since there is no aether, this makes the Cosmic Microwave Background and effect of matter, apparently validating Lemaitre's premieval material atom. But this goes against Nature, as proven by the Hubble Tension.

Instead of simply restoring the aether, physicists invent a hack as different physics for the early universe.


2. Quantum Gravity for the Cosmological Constant Problem

Einstein's Relativity makes space and time electromagnetic which negates the aether and its energy, as the zero point energy. 

Instead of simply destroying Relativity, physicists try to unify it with Quantum Mechanics leading to quantum gravity theories that are not testable. This is because they don't have a replacement for all of those theories because no one knows about Cartesian Physics.


3. Wormholes, Whiteholes, Hidden Variables not found 

Einstein's other predictions have been disproven or not found. Yet somehow people do not see this as a reason to discard his photo-electric effect, simultaneity, and relativity. 


4. Superluminal motion 

Evidence from quasars, pulsars, and nova shows that light travels faster than c. Yet such evidence is hacked to conform to dogma.


## Superluminal Motion Hacks

Physicists discard the evidence and instead create hacks to bend the evidence into matching the constant speed of light.


### 1. Light Echo

This is used to explain the faster than light movement at the nova V838 Monocerotis

This says that the light from nova is merely reflected off matter around the nova to give the illusion of light traveling faster than c. 

But this would only work if there multiple light sources that conspired or were arranged perfectly to shine light at a backdrop at a close sequence
- This is like light being turned on against a wall in a sequence.
- The 'illusion' is reflection instead of emission


{{< i s="/graphics/physics/echo.jpg" a="Echo" >}}


A light echo would only work if there were many stars emitting light and were exposed sequentially. In the case of V838 Monocerotis, the moving cloud would expose light in a sequential way.

If so, then the expansion should appear in different colors and intensities since the clouds are going through different paths of light. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/echo2.jpg" a="Echo" >}}


But the video clearly shows that the light is homogenous -- it comes from the same source which is likely the central star in the binary star system.

### 2. Relativistic Jets

Physicists claim that M87 jets match Relativity when the actual evidence shows otherwise. 

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/m87.jpg" a="Echo" c="Observation is clearly different from theory" >}}


For example in the video below, they hack the observed speed of light by imposing on it Einstein's light cone (as `speed /(sin14 +(speed/c)cos14)`). 

This of course will reduce the speed to `0.97c`, arbitrarily converting it be within the speed of light dogma.

{{< youtube eAHPW026IjQ >}}

This absurdity is like a beauty contest that decrees that only white skinned people are beautiful. And so the fact that only white people win their contest becomes proof that only white people are beautiful.


## Decartes Solves Both With a Single Principle of Vortices

Instead of multiple hacks like light echo, light cones, shock waves, tachyons, etc, Descartes uses a single principle for all phenomena in outerspace -- spatial vortices. 

Both the expansion speed of the nova and the jets from quasars are governed by space particles which in turn are governed by the center vortex of the star or nova.

{{< youtube 8aRfCpIZKtw >}}

In fact, quasar jets disprove Einstein's Relativity and instead validate Descartes' rotating vortices which convert matter back to energy. This prevents the thermal death of the universe. 

This means that the total energy emited by qusars should match the total matter in galaxies. This means that many bright galaxies with jets are actually quasars. 

Instead of hacking phenomena to coerce them into a dogma, the actual relationships of vortices and variable light-speeds should be studied. 

This will then help us understand the properties of the aether which is in the center of all spatial vortices (callled singularity by physics).

This will then help develop levitation and teleportation technology much faster.
