The Arrow of Time is a non-problem arising from the difference between:
- the nature of the real perception of time, and 
- the nature of the abstract perception (mathematical) of the real perecption of time

Physicists ask why time only moves forward when, mathematically, it is possible to have time mmove both forward and backward.

Time moving forward is proven in the real world by entropy which increases in 'disorder' e.g. We can never uncook an egg.

But why doesn't time move backwards?

We answer that this is because time is a mental phenomena arising from perception as opposed to forgetting.

To ask why the mind perceives is to ask why we exist. And so it is a non problem because existence is just is and cannot be anything else. 


## The Start of the (Non) Problem

The arrow of time problem began when the concept of time dilation was proven as high speeds causing time to slow down.

This led to a simple ratio manifesting as the space time diagram or light cone, arising from Einstein's scam Theory of Relativity:

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/cone.jpg" a="Light Cone" >}}

The problem with ratios and equations is that **the mind can transpose things arbitrarily** e.g 1 + 1 = 2 becomes 2 = 1 + 1 

When applied to the light cone, this leads to theoretical worm holes that lead to time travel as a loop:

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/timetravel.jpg" a="time travel" >}}

Here, the hole physical-izes the mental ability to transpose things in equations. 

And so this whole thing mixes up the nature of actual time with the nature of an imagination of that actual time via math equations.

That's why physicists come up with absurd ideas like:
- gravity being created by time
- the grandfather paradox
- womrholes that allow time travel

In reality, these are just imaginary math 'flexibilities' imposed onto our rigid physical world. 

We can freely imagine:
- space warping from high speeds
- ourselves going back in time to kill our grandfathers
- spaceships going through wormholes into other universes

These fanciful imaginings can match the fanciful transpositions done to abstract math variables. This was fully explained by George Berkely in the 18th century.

{{< q a="George Berkeley" c="The Analyst" >}}
Mathematicians are wonderfully deceived and deluded by their own peculiar Signs, Symbols, or Species just as Men in other Inquiries are often deceived by Words. It is easy to devise Expressions or Notations for Fluxions and Infinitesimals such as dx. ddx. dddx. ddddx &c. These Expressions are clear and distinct. But if we remove the Veil and look underneath and see what they represent, we see much Emptiness, Darkness, and Confusion, direct Impossibilities and Contradictions.

## Time is a Mental Thing

Superphysics explains that time is based on the perception of the change in states. A universe that totally doesn't change, including the observer, will have no time. Rather we say that it is frozen in (a single) time.

Perception is only done by the abstract mind. A rock doesn't care how much time it has spent as a rock.

Therefore, time is purely a mental concept. 

To plants, there is no such thing as day or night. There is only sun and no-sun. This is why they can be made to grow 24/7 with artificial light.

### Time Problems Begin When You Think of It

<!-- The problem with physical time began in the late 19th century when the speed of light was formalized.

Einstein used this formal speed as his `c`. This then became the measure of physical energy by sight.
This necessarily formalized physical time as an 'arrow'.

It's an arrow because we **see** that energy always naturally spreads as entropy and never converges i.e. by design the universe spreads energy because that is how existence itself is maintained.

This corrupted the definition of time by making the 2 other times as electromagnetic. 

### The Start of the Non-Problem: The Quantum Eraser Experiment  -->

**The arrow of time problem actually begins when mathematicians think about it.** This action confounds *physical* changes as physical time with *mental* time.

This then leads to the notion of 'emergent time'. This is the exact sign that physical time and mental time have been mixed up by some mathematician or physicist who has nothing better to do.

The confusion is seen in the **quantum eraser experiment** where entangled particles are thought to change the past observations. But later this was clarified to be a false interpretation only -- the experimenters were claiming retrocausality when what really happened was merely the randomness from interference and non-interference.  

<!-- Mental time in the physical context is explained by quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, such as in the , particles **teleport** instead of going back in time.

However, physics interprets it as going back in time because energy is always in a space and therefore time is the variable -- the particle 'goes back' into a previous energy state. -->


## The Solution

**This problem is easily resolved by not mixing up actual physical time (mental perception of real events) with imaginary mathematical time (mental imposition of what time should be).** 
- Physical time is 'proper time' in Einstein's Relativity
- Mental time is 'coordinate time' 

The physicist must stop thinking about the arrow of physical time, just as the entangled particle does not really care about its energy states -- it just gets those states when it hits something. 

 <!-- accepts those states, reacting to them without thinking. -->

This policy would save a lot of wasted mental effort and funding which should go to better uses like healthcare or environmental protection research.

If a person *really* wants to think about the nature of time, then he has to go into the nature of his abstract mind.
- If he goes into the nature of his own mind, then his analysis goes into Psychology and leaves Physics
- If he goes into the nature of mind in general, then his analysis goes into Metaphysics


Going into either Psychology or Metaphysics leads to the aetherspace which exposes the spatial nature of the mind and therefore the nature of time.
- Material Superphysics deals with physical time travel via UFOs
- Bio Superhysics deals with mental time travel as clairvoyance

Physics does not have these things and so we suggest that they should stop thinking about time travel and time problems otherwise they just waste time going in circles with zero progress despite so much effort. 



<!-- ### Light is not Superior

But physicists refuse to go into Psychology nor Metaphysics, and instead try to analyze *physical* time which is really set by their own minds.

So they study their own impositions which are totally irrelevant to Nature.

Einstein does this by pegging time to the speed of light. 

The blame for this falls squarely on Einstein because he decreed light, and therefore electromagnetic time, to be superior. 

Poincare, the original author of Relativity, did not assign supremacy to light. And so his Relativity never mixed up physical time and mental time -- he never bothers about the arrow of physical time.

This is proven in his Chapter ['The Measure of Time'](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Measure_of_Time)

If humans obey Einstein (and the materialists), then they will keep Physics stuck in a rigid box without any new discoveries.

If people obey Poincare-Lorentz (and the aetherealists) and merge Physics with Metaphysics, then they will free it up and unite Newtonian mechanics with Quantum physics. -->

<!-- If you believe that science should stay stuck and that the planet should heat itself up and cause life to go extinct (since there is no scientific solution), then Einstein logically is a genius. 

But if you believe that science should progress and we can get out of this heated planet by quantum teleportation and faster-than-light travel, then it follows that Einstein is a sophist who trapped humans in an extinction box, achieved faster with nuclear weapons which he himself promoted.
