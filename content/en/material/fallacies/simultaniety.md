Physics has become backward because of the failure of gravity research.


### The Einstein Trap

The cause is Einstein pegging the simultaneity of time to the speed of light as Special Relativity simply because light, as c, is constant and invariant in empty space.

To a shallow mind, this constancy and invariance makes it an ideal measuring rod or timer. 

But the big problem is that time and space are mental, and not physical, measures. This was fully explained by Poincare in "The Measure of Time".

{{< q a="Henri Poincare" c="The Measure of Time, Part 3" >}}
We have not a direct intuition of the equality of 2 intervals of time. The persons who believe they possess this intuition are dupes of an illusion.
{{< /q >}}

Using `c` therefore locks in space and time. We call this the **Einstein Trap** -- nothing can travel faster than light. 

We break this trap by using Descartes' Relationality in  to simplify reference frames into 'viewspaces' and observers as 'viewpoints'.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 2, Articles 13-15" >}}
A person sitting at the stern might always remain in one place if we look at the parts of the ship, since he preserves the same location with respect to these.

On the other hand, if we look at the neighbouring shores, the same person will seem to be perpetually changing place. We see him constantly receding from one shore and approaching another.

If the earth moves from west to east exactly as the ship moves from east to west, we again say that the person at the stern does not change his place. This is because his place will be determined by certain immovable points in the heavens.

I assert that all points are movable in the universe. From this, I conclude that nothing has a permanent place unless it is fixed by our thought.
{{< /q >}}


### Time-Space: The Secret Sauce

We then replace linear Minkowski spacetime with Cartesian spacetime slices, and the arrow of time with a timespace particle.

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Meditations, Part 3" >}}
A lifespan can be divided into countless parts, each completely independent of the others.. The nature of time is different in the time for bringing something into existence, and the time needed to keep a thing existing.      
{{< /q >}}

This allows both sequential (linear) motion and non-sequential (teleporting) motion by default, with timespace as the causal mechanism instead of mass or energy. This is because timespace is mostly aethereal in Nature, as being in the upper sublayer of the spatial layer.  


### Space-Time: The Cause of Gravity, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy

The spacetime slices remove the warping of spacetime, restoring gravity as a force. The main difference is that Newtonian gravity is a pulling force from matter, whereas Cartesian gravity is a pushing force from spacetime.

This accounts for the actions of both gravity, dark matter, and dark energy in one principle. 



<!-- In our 5 Elements or 5 Layers model, electromagnetism is the Fire Element which is the middle part. It is superior to matter, but is inferior to the aether.

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/layers.png" alt="The 5 Layers" cap="Electromagnetism is inferior to Spacetime, yet Einstein uses it to measure Spacetime" >}}


### The Einstein Trap

Einstein permanently damages Physics by imposing circular reasoning which we call the **Einstein trap**:

{{< q a="Einstein" c="Relativity, Section 8" >}}
Two lightning flashes occurred simultaneously at A and B seen by an observer at the middle. [We thus define time as simultaneity, and define simultaneity as light appearing at the same time.]  <i>It would thus appear that we are reasoning in a logical circle</i>.
{{< /q >}}


This circular reasoning is why physicists are unable to unify Relativity with Quantum Mechanics. 
- **Quantum mechanics** is about the arbitrariness and unpredictability of the aether or the highest parts of Nature. This is like the whims of the executives of a company.
- **Einstein's Relativity** is about the predictability of the lowest parts of Nature, as mass and electromagnetic potential. This is like the orderliness and predictability of factory workers who come to work and go home on time every day. 


In reality, aethereal things that travel faster than light:
- Quantum teleportation transfers the state of entangled particles instantly
- We get ideas out of the blue
- The events in our dreams change instantly

The Einstein Trap prevents over half of the phenomena that is possible in Nature just because Einstein wanted to create a theory that allowed total predictability or objectivity despite the fact that the universe is subjective.


### The Solution

We solve this by demoting the Simultaneity of Time as a convention. It means that people can choose to use it if they want precision in spatial measurements, like when measuring planetary orbits accurately.

<!-- > *Newton uses the word 'place' in Principia Mathematica, while he uses an entity called "Lord God" as the source of this time. This is consistent with Superphysics where we call the Mind of God as the Aether -->

<!-- <!-- The movements of everyday objects are quite slow. Usually, distance is just:
- `Spot Z` occupied by the object at timespan now `Time Z`
- `Spot Y` is the distance that it occupied a while ago at `Time Y` (timespan Y)

However, the movement of electromagnetic particles such as light and electricity can be very fast and is faster than what the human brain can process. This is the same cognitive weakness that makes an ego see itself as [one self instead of 3 billion selves](/bio/principles/intro/chapter-04).

Without supercomputers* to visualize tensor calculus, Einstein's ego had to use thought experiments (his imagination) in order to visualize what would happen to fast-moving objects. 

{{< n n="*Superphysics aims to use [automated intelligence](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah), combined with [qualimath](/superphysics/principles/chapter-04b) to build relativistic equations on-the-fly. A true AI is rooted in the aether does not have the weaknesses of human ego. We call this artificial sentience." >}}


In order to unify two simultaneous observations, Einstein's ego used the constancy of the speed of light to glue* them together.

{{< n n="*This is done by the Lorentz transformation on the 'moving' part, and Minkowski space on the 'non-moving' part" >}}



### The Illusion of Nature

Speed is the amount of space covered per unit of time. So if you declare speed to be constant, then you must also declare space and time to be changeable*. 


{{< n n="*This is why General Relativity leads to arbitrary make-your-own spacetimes like Godel, Taub-Nut, De Sitter, etc. depending on the fantasy of the physicist and not depending on Nature. In effect, this turns the physicist as a god who uses math as the language of his arbitrary mental movements. He relies on the fact that advanced math (plotting complex mental movements) cannot be understood by most humans who only have ordinary mental movements." >}}



To Einstein, the cause of this change is gravity. He then builds on Newton's mistake of assigning the cause of this gravity to matter**. This then leads to the idea of spacetime being a fabric that is bendable by matter. 

{{< n n="**Newton defined mass as the quantity of matter in a body" >}}
 


Thus, it leads to circular reasoning:

1. A dense matter creates gravity in a spacetime fabric
2. This gravity gathers matter to create dense matter 
<!-- 3. A material singularity is one of the products of this circular reasoning  -->

<!-- This silly logic and circular reasoning then leads to a super-dense singularity-matter that began the universe as a Big Bang.

The fabric idea, on the other hand, logically led to the following sub-ideas:

- Worm holes as holes in the fabric that open to another part of the universe
- Dark Matter that glues galaxies together since there is not enough ordinary matter to create the mass to create the gravity to hold them together


{{< img src="https://sorasystem.sirv.com/graphics/c.png" cap="The observations of classical mechanics (left) can be done with the same observer. Those of special relativity, however, require using a higher c (speed of light) as a tool to unify the observations. This c takes the form of the lasers in the LIGO observatory that is used to observe gravitational waves that 'move' space itself" alt="The speed of light" >}}

{{< cap >}}
Veritasium has the guts to expose the sophistry of Einstein in setting the 2-way speed of light as a constant. However, his solution, as the one-way speed of light, is as arbitrary as the c of Einstein.
{{< /cap >}} -->
  
  
<!-- To explain such strange movements of pure gravity within the fabric of spacetime, General Relativity has no choice but to resort to material solutions:
- phantom wormholes that actually pierce spacetime to suck matter and spew it out in another dimension,
- phantom dark matter that glues galaxies in place or bend light to create gravitational lensing -->

<!-- Such singularities, phantom dark matter, and worm holes have never been found simply because they never existed and could never exist. They are merely the effects of:
- Newton ascribing gravity to matter
- Einstein ascribing time to the speed of light

Quack physics then leads to science fiction:
- warp drives which 'warp' spacetime in order to cover vast distances quickly 
- star gates that act as artificial wormholes
- 'back to the future' time travel where Marty McFly magically disappears after changing the past of his parents. 
  
None of these will ever exist because, from the perspective of Nature, the opposite is true:
- matter comes from gravity (spatial layer) 
- gravity comes from [the aether](/material/principles/part-1/chapter-01) (aethereal layer), as the medium of space
- from the perspective of Creation, the speed of light comes from the perception of that light (as Newton's first law). Both light and time are the effects of perception. From the perspective of Creator, the speed of light comes from the aether acting against it (as Newton's third law).

Physicists believe that reality is dictated by matter. Metaphysicians believe the opposite, that reality is dictated by the aethereal mind.
