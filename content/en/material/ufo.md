Superphysics uses information from all possible sources to increase the knowledge about a topic or subject. 

This means we take information from sources from ancient times, various cultures, and even non-humans, as channeled aliens, elementals, etc.

An example of channeled information is the Quran which was channeled* through the Prophet Mohammad.    

{{< n n="The knowledge from Allah seems consistent with the knowledge of the alien Anunnaki" >}}

<!-- *Such information can only come from 3 sources: ex-physical beings in spirit form, Elementals, or aliens. Because of Its errors in astrophysics, we speculate that the 'We' in the Quran are an Elemental of a much higher level than Jinns, while Allah is either an alien from Sirius (as the Lord of Sirius) or an oversoul in Sirius. This is solely based on the information provided in the Quran -->
  
We validate our Material Superphysics principles and technology proposals by comparing them with those of advanced alien races. This either:
- gives us confidence in the principle, or
- makes us overhaul the principle to match both the current reality and the future or advanced reality


A known alien technology is the UFO that was revealed by Bob Lazar. 

<!-- oravlH5QoSY -->

It has 3 main parts:

1. Antimatter reactor
2. Gravity amplifiers and wave guides
3. Sensor array

## Gravity Amplifiers

Lazar sources anti-gravity from the Gravity-A wave from the proton.
- We call this as the aetherspace or most2 in Material Superphysics
- This is known as the gluon field in Modern Physics

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/gravitya.jpg" a="Gravity A is the aetherspace" c="Gravity A is the aetherspace in Superphysics" >}}


His explanation for the gravity amplifiers fit with Cartesian Physics which regards gravity as a pushing force.

However, his source for anti-gravity is the atom's aetherspace which he says extends past the atom's perimeter. 

This excess aetherspace is then amplified and then phase-shift to propel the ship, converting to the gravity-B waves or the force of spacetime (most1 in Superphysics). 

We agree that the aetherspace can be amplified, made larger, and then funneled to certain directions.

This is because that technique matches known telekinesis wherein organic chi is the aetherspace which is then harnessed or pooled and then directed to a certain direction to create physical movement.

The main mechanism for human levitation is pranah or biological mosts. Descartes calls them animal spirits which is detected by the heart and is then normally sent to the brain. 

Levitators hack this by letting the pranah skip the brain and instead go to wherever his abstract mind (non-physical mind) wants. This translates to either telekinesis or levitation. 

The main advantage of propulsion by aetherspace or chi is that it uses far less physical energy than Newtonian rockets. 

Its main disadvantage is that it is very subtle and so it needs a lot of intellect to process. It follows that it cannot be done without advanced machine learning, something that rockets do not need. 

<!-- However, our preferred theoretical way is to source the aetherspace from the electrons instead of the proton, as kind of aether-force field which then manipulates most1.

Manipulating the force of spacetime uses energy. But the use of energy in Superphysics and Lazar's mechanics is much less than in Newtonian-Einstein Physics. 

The low energy use is evident in the people who can levitate using their chakras. They do not need a lot of energy, nor feel exhausted after levitating.   -->


## Antimatter Reactor

This uses Element 115 which produces antimatter to create energy. 

Lazar explains that a proton is added to Element 115 for it to become Element 116 which then decays and releases antimatter. This antimatter then reacts with a gas to create energy, converted to electricity at near 100% efficiency. 

We speculate that Element 115 is not a natural element (mode of matter) but is rather a high-energy artificial element enriched by continuous fusion reactions. 
- It would have a lot of neutrons to make it very unstable. This is why it converts readily when a proton is added, to become the unstable Element 116.

It then decays into antimatter. This means that the proton triggered the instability among the neutrons, causing it to decay and produce a lot of antimatter or free aether (qoas).

{{< youtube i1c07TuLqeg >}}

 <!-- instead of cancelling the gluon bonds.  -->

Such instability is usually created by humans in linear accelerators where high-energy matter is smashed into iridium. The main difference with the UFO reactor is that Element 115 is **not** being accelerated, nor is it being smashed into anything.

So we can say that Element 115 is inherently ready-to-be-destabilized. This can only happen if it were made artificially.


## Sensor Array

These collect information from the outside world, similar to cameras and detectors in a self-driving car. 

This would be similar to our concept of a solar eye:

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/solareye.jpg" a="Solar Eye" >}}

The solar eye gets all the data about the outside universe so that the spacetime and timespace (time operator in quantum mechanics) of the craft can be compared with the outside spacetime. 

This allows the ship's timespace to be adjusted so that it can tap into the aetherspace and teleport to the other location, bypassing spacetime. 

In the UFO design, the sensor array is directly above the wave amplifiers so that it can act as one unit, as front and back.
