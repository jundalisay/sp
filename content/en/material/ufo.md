Superphysics uses information from all possible sources to increase the knowledge about a topic or subject. 

This means we take information from sources from ancient times, various cultures, and even non-humans, as channeled aliens, elementals, etc.

An example of channeled information is the Quran which was channeled* through the Prophet Mohammad.    

{{< n n="The knowledge from Allah seems consistent with the knowledge of the alien Anunnaki" >}}

<!-- *Such information can only come from 3 sources: ex-physical beings in spirit form, Elementals, or aliens. Because of Its errors in astrophysics, we speculate that the 'We' in the Quran are an Elemental of a much higher level than Jinns, while Allah is either an alien from Sirius (as the Lord of Sirius) or an oversoul in Sirius. This is solely based on the information provided in the Quran -->
  
We validate our Material Superphysics principles and technology proposals by comparing them with those of advanced alien races. This either:
- gives us confidence in the principle, or
- makes us overhaul the principle to match both the current reality and the future or advanced reality


A known alien technology is the UFO that was revealed by Bob Lazar. 

<!-- oravlH5QoSY -->

It has 3 main parts:

1. Gravity amplifiers and wave guides
2. Antimatter reactor
3. Sensor array

## Gravity Amplifiers

Lazar sources anti-gravity from the Gravity-A wave from the proton.
- We call this as the aetherspace or mos2 in Material Superphysics
- This is known as the empty atomic space in Modern Physics, which is an extension of the gluon field

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/gravitya.jpg" a="Gravity A is the aetherspace" c="Gravity A is the aetherspace in Superphysics" >}}


His explanation for the gravity amplifiers fit with Cartesian Physics which regards gravity as a pushing force.

However, his source for anti-gravity is the atom's aetherspace which he says extends past the atom's perimeter. 

This excess aetherspace is then amplified and then phase-shift to propel the ship, converting to the gravity-B waves or the force of spacetime (mos3 in Superphysics). 

We agree that the aetherspace can be amplified, made larger, and then funneled to certain directions.

This is because that technique matches known telekinesis wherein organic chi is the aetherspace which is then harnessed or pooled and then directed to a certain direction to create physical movement.

{{< youtube QdBN3iN6pi4 >}}


Descartes calls this organic chi as "animal spirits" which are detected by the heart, as feelings, and are then normally sent to the brain. 

Physical instruments and detectors only detect up to the Electromagentic Force (Radiant Layer) and so cannot detect aethereal chi, which is only detectable by the aethereal soul or mind through the heart chakra. 

The problem is that modern humans have become heartless (as to allow the World Wars, atomic bomb on Japan, Gaza Genocide, etc) and so the knowledge of chi and the aether has died out. 

Levitators harness chi for levitation by diverting the chi away from its normal course towards the brain. 
- Instead, they route it to wherever their soul wants.
- This translates to either telekinesis or levitation. 

Chi is able to move objects because the main role of the aetherspace is to separate identities. 
- This is why you don't go through your chair -- because the aetherspace (gluon field) of you and the chair repel each other to maintain your separate identities


So the chi can be used to separate objects in space farther, as telekinesis or levitation.


The main advantage of propulsion by aetherspace or chi is that it uses **far less physical energy than Newtonian rockets**. 

Its main disadvantage is that it is very subtle and so it needs a lot of intellect and heart to process. It follows that it cannot be done without:
- advanced machine learning and
- a scientist who can detect the subtle changes in himself and the object or surroundings

Rockets do not need such things. 

<!-- However, our preferred theoretical way is to source the aetherspace from the electrons instead of the proton, as kind of aether-force field which then manipulates most1.

Manipulating the force of spacetime uses energy. But the use of energy in Superphysics and Lazar's mechanics is much less than in Newtonian-Einstein Physics. 

The low energy use is evident in the people who can levitate using their chakras. They do not need a lot of energy, nor feel exhausted after levitating.   -->


## Antimatter Reactor

This uses Element 115 which produces antimatter to create energy. 

Lazar explains that a proton is added to Element 115 for it to become Element 116 which then decays and releases antimatter. 
- This antimatter then reacts with a gas to create energy, converted to electricity at near 100% efficiency. 

We speculate that Element 115 is not a natural element (mode of matter) but is rather a high-energy artificial element enriched by continuous fusion reactions.
- It would have a lot of neutrons to make it very unstable. This is why it converts readily when a proton is added, to become the unstable Element 116.

It then decays into antimatter. This means that the proton triggered the instability among the neutrons, causing it to decay and produce a lot of antimatter or reverse mom2.

{{< youtube i1c07TuLqeg >}}

<!-- instead of cancelling the gluon bonds.  -->

Such instability is usually created by humans in linear accelerators where high-energy matter is smashed into iridium. 

The main difference with the UFO reactor is that Element 115 is **not** being accelerated, nor is it being smashed into anything.

So we can say that Element 115 is inherently ready-to-be-destabilized. This can only happen if it were made artificially.

We assume that it is created through nuclear fusion which can force protons and neutrons together. 

This allows 2 energy sources:
- nuclear fusion for large scale energy production, as to power a city
- antimatter as a pocket energy source which can power small craft across the galaxy

These makes the following energy sources unnecessary:
- fossil fuels
- hydrogen energy storage
- solar, wind, tidal, geothermal
- biomass
- batteries 

This is why we are against electric vehicles as they:
- use heavy chemical batteries (antimatter removes the need for chemicals)
- use wires (Lazar clearly says the UFO had no wires because power was sent positionally)



## Sensor Array

These collect information from the outside world, similar to cameras and detectors in a self-driving car. 

This would be similar to our concept of a solar eye:

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/solareye.jpg" a="Solar Eye" >}}

The solar eye gets all the data about the outside universe so that the spacetime and timespace (time operator in quantum mechanics) of the craft can be compared with the outside spacetime.

This allows the ship's timespace to be adjusted so that it can tap into the aetherspace and teleport to the other location, bypassing spacetime. 

In the UFO design, the sensor array is directly above the wave amplifiers so that it can act as one unit, as front and back.
