Last month, scientists at Fermilab in the United States announced a potential fifth force of nature through their "Muon g-2 Experiment".

The experiment looked into the behavior of subatomic magnetic particles called muons. 


## What Does G-2 Mean?

According to quantum mechanics of the 1930's, magnetic particles have a "gyromagnetic ratio" which is notated as "g". 
- This ratio is the magnetic strength of the particle compared to its spin. 

In theory, a muon should have a `g` of 2. However, when they measured it in 1948, it was revealed to be 2.00238.

Where did the 0.00238 come from?

This discrepancy led to the invention of Quantum Electrodynamics by Richard Feynman to account for the excess beyond 2, among others.

From 2006, and in 2021, scientists in the US measured the muon's `g` again, and then compared the results with those predicted by both:
- Quantum Electrodynamics
- Quantum Chromodynamics. 

They found the difference to be smaller, with the measured value being different from the theoretical prediction from 9 decimal places.

Such a small difference could not be explained by current quantum electromagnetic theories. And so scientists postulated a new, "Fifth Force" to explain it. 

According to Fermilab, that Fifth Force must have the following properties:
- It has a lower mass than protons
- It must not interact with electrons
- It only interacts weakly with muons


## The Fifth Force as the Convertible Internal Boundary or CIB (X17)
<!-- Qost3 -->

According to those requirements, we assert that the "Fifth Force" is nothing but the Convertible Internal Boundary (CIB) which is known to Physics as X17 because it has a mass of 17 MeV. 

These interact with muons (qor2) and increase their magnetic moment **right after** the collision by increasing the size of their hole. This increased hole allows more virtual photons to pass through, increasing the muon's magentism.

, but not smaller electrons (qor1)  -->

- The CIB cannot interact with electrons which are already too far up in the Layers hierachy (which makes electrons small). 
- The CIB is too small or weak for the tau which makes its impact on the tau not noticeable.

The Muon g-2 experiment, as well as the X17 Atomki anomaly, helped us complete our MSQ model which has internal boundaries for all 5 Layers. This made us realize that the edge of the observable universe is the boundary for the Spatial Layer (2nd Element of Descartes)

This is then consistent with us naming the boundaries as boundaries.
