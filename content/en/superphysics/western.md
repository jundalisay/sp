The domineering nature of the Negative Force in the human species is best seen in the Western culture which sees itself superior to others. 

This is obvious in their colonization of the world wherein they imposed their culture onto others, without bowing down or absorbing those foreign cultures. 

This extends even to philosophy. For example, Hegel does not think that the Asian way of thinking is correct:

{{< q a="Hegel" c="The Beginning of the History of Philosophy" >}}
Consequently, philosophical knowledge is not to be looked for in the Orient, since philosophical knowledge should know the substance, i.e., the universal insofar as I think it, develop it within me, determine it, in such a way that in the substance I have my own determinations

## The Problems with Western Philosophy: Rambling and Shallow

By comparing the works of Confucius, Buddha, and the Vedas, with the works of Aristotle, Kant, and Hegel, we see that the main difference is that the Asians **do not need to give a step by step account for their thinking process**. 

The Europeans and Greeks, on the other hand, have to explain each step of their logic painstakingly. This makes the Western systems very tedious. More importantly, it also produces less useful things because the energy is wasted on the steps instead of the actual destination.

This is evident even in modern works. Hitler for example, rambles a lot in his Mein Kampf just to advance a few concepts:
- The superiority of the Germans
- The need to start a new World War to prove that superiority over the French, Jews, and Marxists. 


Eastern Philosophy does not dwell into the thinking process because it aims for the actual cause or solution. This is why Buddhism points the cause of suffering to desires, and the solution to suffering as the control of the desires. 

In contrast, Hegel and Kant merely ramble about things and do not produce anything memorable that would represent a solution to whatever they were rambling about. 

Marx and Mill are more useful, as they create real policies as their proposed solutions to the problems that they perceive. 

However, their difference from Eastern philosophy is that they are based on shallow observation and not the nature of things. 

This is why the Capitalism of Mill and the Communism of Marx both end up not solving the problems of poverty, inequality, recessions, inflation, debt, etc. 


## The Problems with Asian Philosophy: Lack of Detail and Deep Abstraction

This lack of detail in Asian philosophy is an advantage, but also a disadvantage. 

It presents ideas that are so obscure. 

This allows anyone to make their own interpretations and shortcuts.

For example, Confucius just gives major ideas, but does not explain how he got them or what will they result in or what are its variations.  

This gets weak-willed people lost since they are unable to jump from Step 1 to Step 50 (the end result) by themselves. 

Instead, they need a teacher to painstakingly teach them Step 2, Step 3, Step 4 and so on, instead of them discovering those mini-steps themselves.

The Vedas, Yogic, and Tantric texts explain deeply how the universe works. But they are clouded in unclear definitions and analogies. 

For example, Patanjali explains the mechanisms behind the occult powers, but does not explain the step-by-step process to harness those powers. 

So you get a lot of gurus and yoga groups giving wildly different explanations, techniques, and practices.

## Superphysics Solution: Merging of East and West

Superphysics solves this by basing its principles in Asian spirituality, then using Western data and definitions and logic to  explain those principles to get practical results.

For example, Socratic Dialectics uses the higher mind, developed through Asian spiritual practice, to churn through real data from observation in order to come up with solutions that can be explained in a step by step way.
