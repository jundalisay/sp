The previous section exposed the materialist view as the dominant, but wrong view of reality and how the universe works. 

We correct this with a  natural holistic view of the universe as something that is infinite and eternal. 

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Heavens, Book 1, Chapter 10" >}}
The universe cannot be at once eternal and generated. To say that the universe alternately combines and dissolves is no more paradoxical than to make it eternal but varying in shape.
{{< /q >}}


The reason for the prevalence of the wrong materialist belief is that the prevailing mentality downplays the imagination and the metaphysical domain. 

Instead, it enshrines materialism and the physical domain, such as through physical comfort, physical pleasures, etc. 


The natural view is that the universe and reality are based on perception as the unit mind being within the Supreme Mind.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/natural.jpg" a="Materialist vs Natural" c="The natural view puts the physical universe inside the the abstract mind of the Supreme" >}}


Since perception is subjective, it follows that the universe is subjective. This leads to:
- the malleability of space as teleportation
- the malleability of time as time travel
- customization of reality as alternate realities

The materialist view of the universe belittles the metaphysical domain and treats it as insignificant, while enshrining the physical domain of physical sensations.

The natural or spiritual view of the universe, on the other hand:
- downplays physicality, calling it as an illusion or at least, something very crude and insignificant
- give supreme emphasis on the metaphysical domain, specifically on the Supreme Entity that generates Existence


## So What's the Use of the Natural View of the Univese?

The natural view gets rid of the limitations imposed by the materialist view and expands mentality into the invisible aether. 

This leads to solutions that are impossible to materialist science as they are seen as "pseudo-science"


Science | Metaphysical Upgrade
--- | ---
Physics | Adopt the aether to allow anti-gravity, and relationality to downplay Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
Medicine | Adopt the aether to allow Ayurveda, Chinese Medicine, Naturopathy for more diverse cures
Politics | Adopt the aether to harmonize minds and political parties based on core idea
Biology | Adopt the aether as Lamarckism willpower as the cause for change and evolution (i.e. we can will a harmonized world)
Psychology | Adopt the aether, as Descartes animal spirits or Taoist chi, as the cause of behavior to better create behavior change
