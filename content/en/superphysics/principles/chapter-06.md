Each Idea is Unique | The Uniqueness is Denoted by a Gravitational Signature
{{< /dc >}}



The Law of Conservation of Idea explained that all ideas are unique. 

<!-- - all movement comes from the idea repelling or attracting others due to its inherent dharma or true nature -->

This uniqueness is an inherent propety in the identity that comes from itself as a part of the Supreme Entity.

This uniqueness gets its uniqueness from the fact that there is only one Supreme Entity.

The intherent property or nature of an identity, with a relation to its creator or inventor, is called dharma. 
- The word 'nature' nowadays implies inherence, not necessarily a creator or external causer.   
- This is different from the ancient 'nature' in natural philosophy which implied a Supreme Entity. 
    

## The Gravitational Signature

We notate this dharma of the identity as `G` which stands for a **gravitational signature**. 

{{< q a="Paracelsus" >}}
What is the Signature of things? Things are signed by whom? Who is the Signator? How many things are signed? The signs of Physiognomy are from the stars.
{{< /q >}}


This `G` is unique for every thing. 

Combine all `G`s into a single idea and you get the Absolute Entity as `1`. 

{{< q a="Parmenides" c="Parmenides by Plato, Chapter 11" >}}
Therefore, if the One exists, then One is all things and also nothing, both in relation to itself and to other things.
{{< /q >}}


This signature manifests:
- as waves in metaphysicality, where waves can be blended to occupy the same space
- as spin in physicality where discreteness is imposed by the Negative Force
  - This results in either clash for similar spins or cohesion for opposing spins

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/gears.gif" a="Gears" c="Opposing gears work together, similar gears clash" >}}


Therefore, the harmony or disharmony between waves lead to attraction and cohesion or repulsion and disintegration.

- The harmony between signatures and spins is called dharma, and is sustaining and productive. 
- The disharmony is called adharma and is evil and destructive.

Superphysics solves problems by restoring things to their proper state or configuration which matches their dharma. 

- If the dharma of societies stop, then they go to war and destroy each other.
- If the dharma of your car stops, then it breaks down, leaving you in the middle of nowhere. 
- If the dharma of your body stops, then you get sick unable to do anything useful.



{{< q a="Buddha" c="Dhammacakkappavattana" >}}
The Noble Eightfold Path is right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. This is the middle way realized by the Tathagata that produces vision, knowledge, leading to calm, direct knowledge, self-awakening, and Unbinding.
{{< /q >}}


The right or dharmic view, resolve, speech, action, livelihood, etc are those that match one's svadharma, true nature, or inherent spin as designed or intended by the Supreme. 

This intention is personal, known only to the unit identity and the Supreme Entity as an inherent, unbreakable relation.


## How Can We Realize the Gravitational Signature of Things?

The knowledge of this inherent signature, spin, or true nature makes one's existence more postive, harmonious and energetic. 

Finding this `G` has been the aim of the sciences.


{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Nova Organum, Book 2, Chapter 1" >}}
Our rule for a method to discover the nature of a body is that it should be certain, free and preparatory, or having relation to practice. This is the same as the discovery of a true form. This is because when a true form is assigned, the corresponding nature infallibly follows.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- <br><br>If G is neglected in the metaphysical dimension, then selfish-interest will slowly creep in, manifesting as blind belief, oligrachy, liberalism (or libertarianism), and then tyranny.<br> If G is neglected in the physical dimension, then inferior theories and technologies will dominate. An example is rocketry which dangerous, expensive, and is unable to allow travel to other galaxies.  -->

There are 2 ways to probe this `G`:

1. Intellectual 

This uses the lower Elements (matter, light) to indirectly unlock the `G` which resides in the invisible or virtual aether. 

Sciences use this approach.

2. Intuitional

This uses the upper Elements (aether, space and time) to directly unlock the `G`. 

Philosophy and spirituality use this approach.


<!-- ## The `G` of Human Nature

According to Socrates, the discovery of the `G` or true nature of everything is extremely laborious. This is why we start in the economic layer so that a success here can give us the resources to help us extend our searches to all the other layers and fiels of metaphysics and physics. 

David Hume, who was an economist aside from being a metaphysician, agrees to this targetting of the human first, instead of his external environment:

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Advertisement" >}}
Here, the only expedient for success in our philosophical researches is to.. march up directly to the capital or center of these sciences, to human nature itself. Once we master human nature, we may hope for an easy victory everywhere else. From here, we may extend our conquests over all those sciences.. We may hope to establishâ€¦ a science which will not be inferior in certainty, and will be much superior in utility. The science of man is the only solid foundation for the other sciences.
