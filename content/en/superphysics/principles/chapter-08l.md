The previous section explained how Socratic Dialectics arrives at solutions by anchoring itself in the true nature of things and then exposing the negative through *active* back and forth probing.

<!--  uses data science because it needs a lot of data to expose the truth-patterns by probing
- data science is really an art -->

Therefore it exposes the truth in each situation or issue in a superior way to science which has no access to the metpahysical domain.

This is because science is the pursuit of knowledge about the physical world only. 

 <!-- through observation, experimentation, and reasoning. -->


## Mysticism is a Pursuit of Deeper Knowledge

The system to go beyond the physical and into the metaphysical is called mysticism, something which Socrates also dealt with.

{{< q a="Socrates" c="Meno by Plato, Chapter 3" >}}
The soul, then, as being immortal, and having been born again many times, and having seen all things that exist, whether in this world or in the world below, has knowledge of them all. It is no wonder that she should be able to call to remembrance all that she ever knew about virtue, and about everything.
{{< /q >}}


We can say that mysticism is a subtle or metaphysical science that becomes spirituality when it starts to aim for yoga or union with the Supreme. 


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Knowledge, Chapter 7">}}
Mysticism is when the subtle aesthetic science reaches a certain standard. It becomes spirituality when it reaches the pinnacle of human glory. 
{{< /q >}}


Mysticism takes the form of Spiritual Superphysics which has its own math called Qualimath, just as Newtonian Physics developed its own math called Calculus. -


## The Shortcomings of (Materialist) Science and Math

The current sciences is totally based on shallow physical perceptions of things that already exist. This makes it the opposite of mysticism which is totally based on metaphysical perceptions as ideas and feelings.  

Science uses math to plot the patterns of its  physical perceptions. From those patterns, it tries to work back to the cause.

The problem here is that **all causes are metaphysical in nature, since all causes are based on ideas and feelings**

- Terrorism is caused by the angry feelings of the terrorist and the idea to use bombs to express his anger
- Supertyphoons are caused by the feelings of heat by the planet <!-- ideas of thermodynamics leading to the compound idea of --> as global warming
- Covid is caused by the idea of coronaviruses which are felt as symptoms of coughing, fever, loss of taste, etc. Before science, epidemics were thought to be caused by evil spirits of unknown cause. Both science and non-science are ignorant of the root cause of such viruses and evil spirits. Superphysics classifies viruses as Elementals, the same as Nature Spirits.

 <!-- as [coming from stars](/bio/solutions/covid-star), just like all matter comes from supernovae (star explosion). -->

<!-- This is in line with the ancient 5 Elements model and is what Kepler's data-driven astrology was trying to prove. Unfortunately, science only took his astronomical observations, as Kepler's Laws. You could think of stars and supernovae as the 'deploy' phase of the aethereal ideas of the Supreme onto reality. -->


Math and science have nothing on the nature of ideas and feelings, and the souls that have those feelings and ideas. 

The best that they can do is to speculate on the causes of problems based on the pattern of effects.
-  It's like a blind man groping in the dark to discover where he is or what's around him. 

For example, science knows that global warming is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. But it is helpless in actually solving those emissions which is rooted in the love for the causes of emissions:
- the love of eating meat
- the love of electricity and oil
- the love of clearing ugly forests to build beautiful real estate
- and so on 

This is why global warming, as well as other problems like nuclear weapons, genocide, plastic pollution are still here.

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Book 7" >}}
Surely the skilled mathematician is not a dialectician.
{{< /q >}}



## The Upgrade by Socratic Dialectics: The Guardian Class

Socratic Dialectics upgrades the sciences by finding patterns both:
- in physical perceptions and facts
- in metaphysical perceptions as the feelings, opinions, and interpretation of the facts by other minds.


In Superphysics, physical hormones are the effects of the changes to the metaphysical chakras.
- Likewise, the soul is the cause, brain activity is the effect.


<!-- "*Recall that we [divided reality into the physical and metaphysical domains](/superphysics/principles/chapter-01). Physical things exist in the former, while metaphysical things, such as ideas and feelings, exist in the latter. Metaphysics is the cause, physics is the effect.  The chakras are the cause, the hormones are the effect." -->


Science only deals with the interpetation of a dataset. But Dialectics deals with **all possible interpetations** of a dataset. 

By getting all the data, as well as all the interpretations of the data, then total knowledge is achieved. 


{{< img src="/graphics/super/dialectics.jpg" alt="Socratic dialectics" cap="The Dialectics of Aristotle is merely based on a thesis. The Dialectics of Socrates is based on the True Nature of a thing as it was designed by the Supreme" >}}


But not all data is useful, just as not all interpretations are valid. 

To solve this, Socratic Dialectics uses wise minds to churn, project, then weed out the bad data and interpretations to preserve only the good and solid ones. Such minds have a more solid grasp of both metaphysics and physics or science and have no bias.

Socrates calls these wise minds as Guardians.


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato" c="Book 3, Chapter 4" >}}
We should have the best of guardians for our city. They should be wise, efficient, and have a special care of the State
{{< /q >}}


Socrates does the churning process, to separate truth from falsehood, as the **Socratic method**. In it, a wise mind takes an idea from a theorist and then walks forward with the theorist's mind towards the projected effect of his idea, or backwards in order to discover the cause together.

<!-- The natural contradiction between the metaphysical and physical dimensions then manifest as the "contradictions" which Hegel emphasized.  -->


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato" >}}
A person will find himself at the top of the intellectual world when he tries to discover the absolute by the light of reason only [via intution], without the help of the senses, and perseveres by pure intelligence until perceives the absolute good [dharma or tao]. This is the same as the sight that has seen the visible. This progress is called dialectic.
{{< /q >}}


{{< q a="Parmenides" c="Parmenides by Plato Simplified" >}}
You should go a step further, and <i>consider not only the consequences which flow from a given hypothesis, but also the consequences which flow from denying the hypothesis.</i>
{{< /q >}}


 <!-- For example, he can predict that a policy on mask-wearing will be accepted by City A but rejected by City B.  -->

Inferior theorists, such as Kant, would likely be filtered out by such minds. This explains why Kant attacked Dialectics: 

{{< q a="Kant" c="Critique of Pure Reason Simplified, Part 2, Introduction" >}}
Dialectics is a logic of illusion. It is a sophistical art for giving ignorance and intentional sophistries.. it teaches us nothing regarding the content of our cognitions. It merely shows the formal conditions of their accordance with the understanding, which do not relate to and are quite indifferent in respect of objects. Any attempt to employ it as a tool to extend our knowledge must end in mere nonsense since anyone can oppose any assertion.
{{< /q >}}


<!-- > *For example, the collapse of the USSR clearly shows that the ideas of Marx and Lenin were wrong. Thus, they can never be regarded as Socratic dialecticians. On the other hand, the ideas of The Prophet Mohammad, Jesus, and Buddha have persisted and flourished. These prove that they are in line with the True Nature of things.  -->


## Update October 13, 2025: A Black Box of Principles

The distillation of the total knowledge then leads to a single pattern knowledge called **principles** which form the foundation of Superphysics.


<!-- A product of the distillation of the knowledge* of Western and Eastern philosophy then produces universal and timeless principles which we call The Metaphysics of Things or MoT. -->
<!-- https://play.google.com/store/books/details/['Juan']_Dalisay_Jr_The_Metaphysics_of_Things_Book_1?id=JY3tDwAAQBAJ -->

Unlike metaphysical principles which are purely theoretical, the principles must survive in physical reality, either as actual evidence, demonstrations, or successful predictions.

Problems will be run through the black box of principles in order to come up with a set of answers or action steps that can be adopted. The results of those actions can then be run through the black box again to come up with a new recommendation or prediction.

This is currently done by large language models to come up with better answers as time passes and more info is provided to it.


{{< dc t="Update: December 2021" >}}
Below are examples of real-world predictions we made using this system.

Science | Evidence
--- | ---
Bio Superphysics | The success of traditional Chinese medicine against Covid, relative to their total lack in the West
Economic Superphysics | The correct prediction of the crisis years starting in 2019 onwards, relative to a prediction of a recovery in 2021 from pent-up demand and vaccine success
Social Superphysics | The low cases of mass shootings, conflict, and revolutions in Asia, relative to the Americas and Africa
Material Superphysics | The prediction that fusion will not work because artificial gravity has not been discovered yet
{{< /dc >}}


<!-- This is what Socrtatic Dialectics does. This technique was also used in the Bhagavad Gita and the Analects by Confucius. -->

If the scientific revolution upgraded the natural philosopher into a scientist, then the dialectical revolution will upgrade the scientist into a superscientist (or dialectical scientist), with the upgrade representing a 'level-up' in human understanding. 

Current | Enlightened
--- | ---
Physicist | "Mespee"
Biologist | Superbiologist
Chemist | Superchemist
Economist | Supereconomist
Doctor | Superdoctor


<!-- This upgrade manifests as the huge amounts of data and information absorbed and processed by the dialectician from all sources:
- anywhere in the world 
- of human history

The scientist refuses to accept unscientific information such as myths and metaphysical works. 
- They immediately refuse ideas from Ayurveda, Feng Shui, Reiki, souls, aliens, other dimensions, etc.

True dialectics is unbiased and so it can take this mass of ideas to be churned in order to extract common patterns that can lead to more solid principles.

For example, it takes the observations on the levitation of Buddhist monks and the zipping of UFOs to add new possibilities of movement and propulsion to benefit space travel. These observations are then put into the black box of dialectical principles in order to create new ones. 

For example, we run [Einstein's General Relativity](/material/fallacies/general-relativity/) through Socrates' principles or black box to reveal its fatal flaws.

We run it again through Descartes' principles to fix it and come up with The Elastic Theory of Gravity that matches Quantum Mechanics. -->


<!-- In the evolution of human understanding, Superphysics is the next and last stage after science.
