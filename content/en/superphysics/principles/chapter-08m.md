The previous section explained that Socratic Dialectics converts Science in to Superphysics by expanding into metaphysics through mysticism or spirituality. 

It uses:
- its own math called Qualimath to describe ideas which are more of quality than quantity. 
- englightened or wise people as the 

Mathematics is based on notating effects quantitatively. And so it is totally impotent in finding true causes of phenomena. 

It also explained how:
- Socratic Dialectics uses wise minds to guide the process of realizing the truth by trial and error.
- Kant was against dialectics


## The German Corruption of Dialectics as Materialist Churn

The Germans were good at math and so they corrupted dialectics into a system that deals with effects instead of the cause. For example, Hegel focused on the fight between negative and positive in dialectics:

{{< q a="Hegel" c="Science of Logic, Introduction" >}}
[The Platonic Dialectic in Parmenides] is based in mere conceit as a subjective itch for unsettling what is fixed.
{{< /q >}}

<!-- Fichte was the one to first use thesis-antithesis-synthesis, then  -->

Chalybaus then misinterpreted this fight in Hegel's dialectic and used it to emphasize thesis-antithesis-synthesis in historical events.

Engels and Marx then fully corrupted this churning of thesis-antithesis-synthesis by saying that it was caused by physical conditions, under materialism. A better churn would result if the material conditions were mastered. 

The dialectical materialism of Marx resulted in evil, suffering, and death, which are the opposite of what the dialectics of Plato and Socrates aimed for.

Materialism, from both the German and British philosophers of the 19th century, extinguished the Enlightenment and led to World Wars, Communist Revolution, and the spread of Panics and Crashes. 
<!-- profit maximization from Modern Economics which caused the 1929 crash and many financial crises. -->

These problems exist until today as terrorism, inequality, and global warming disasters. This is because the same materialistic root was never removed. 

Materialistic science will not be able to solve the problems created by materialism. Only Socratic dialetics, with its metaphysical base, can go out of the box and see the problem with new eyes. 


## The Re-Enlightenment


The modern Materialist Disease:
- was born in the 17th century as Newton's Principia
- adolescence in the 18th century, spreading through the colonial system
- matured in the 19th century
- gained perfection in the 20th century as the Great Depression and the World Wars

It overemphasized mathematics and shallow science leading to so many problems in the world today. 

Socratic Dialectics fixes this by allowing both:
- physical and metaphysical perceptions
- critical thinking and critical feeling

It replaces:
- science with natural philosophy* and mysticism
- the scientific method with a black box of principles 
- math with qualimath and the Francis Bacon Tables as part of the implementation of those principles
