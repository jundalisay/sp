The previous section introduced the Law of Conservation of Idea which says that all ideas:
- already pre-exist and had no beginning
- cannot be created nor destroyed, as having no end
- are unique

This law is the highest conservation law as it is in the highest Element which is the Aether or Spinoza's Substance. 

It follows that the lower Elements have their own conservation laws, each with their own implementing rules which follow the 4 properties of waves.

Element | Conservation law | Implementing Rules
--- | --- | ---
Aether | Idea | 4 Properties of Waves
Air (Space) | Momentum | 4 Rules of Motion (replaces Newton's Laws)
Fire | Energy | 4 Laws of Thermodynamics
Water | Aether | Future Rules on Flavor Changing
Earth | Mass | 4 Rules of Stoichiometry



## Law of Conservation of Momentum

This is for the Air Element or space and time. This is already well known by Physics.

Our innovation is to replace Newton's Laws with the 4 Rules of Motion which makes it applicable to metaphysical objects such as ideas and virtual particles such as space and time particles. 


## Law of Conservation of Energy

This is for the Fire Element, now called Electromagnetism by Physics. 

This is conservation law is also well known by Physics.

Our innovation is to:
- make it applicable to virtual and organic particles such as prana
- replace Newton's Laws with the 4 Rules of Motion which makes it applicable to metaphysical objects such as ideas and virtual particles such as space and time particles. 


## Law of Conservation of Aether

This is for the Water Element, now called Weak Force by Physics. 

This Conservation Law is not known by Physics. 

It says that each Element has the corresponding aether content:

Element | Aether Content
--- | ---
Aether | 5
Air (Space) | 4
Fire (Electromagnetism) | 3
Water (Weak Force) | 2
Earth (Strong Force) | 1


For example, a neutron (2 aether) decays into a proton (1 aether), electron (3 aether), and antineutrino (-2 aether) This gives:

```
2 = 1 + 3 - 2
2 = 2
```

We say that the neutron 'downgraded' into a proton.

Thus the Law of Conservation of Aether accounts for the "elemental" changes in particles as they interact with each other which is done through the Water Element. 

This is why neutrinos are detected through Water Cherenkov Detectors and liquid argon.

This is most obvious in Biology since the body is around 60% water. This leads to the 4 Rules of Conversion listed in Chapter 1d. 



## Law of Conservation of Mass

We cancel the current Mass-Energy Law established by Einstein in order to restore the division of labor of Nature. 

The old Law of Conservation of Mass which used the Laws of Stoichiometry which we reorganize as the 4 Rules of Stoichiometry which is well known in Chemistry.
