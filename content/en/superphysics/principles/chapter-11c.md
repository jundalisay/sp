"Occult" comes from the Latin word occultus, meaning "hidden", "secret", or "concealed".

The concealement is done by the Negative Force which creates the illusion of separate existences.


This will discuss the harnessing of the upper chakras.


## Clairvoyance and Deja Vu


<!-- plotting a course

form a broad general goal 

move towards that goal

choose avenues 

if avenue prevents you then take a step back and find a nother avenue

if avenue is good then choose a subavenues from it. Do not be afraid to take a step back, since not all decisions are correct the first time 

get experience from . choose future possibilities thatyou want

experience will let you gain a hang of patterns or how the Aether moves. So you can just move forward faster using more and more of intuitin and less of intellect.

## Gaining Specific Abilities

This is done by reorganizing your abstract mind to have the same shape and vibration as the skilled person.


## Perceiving Elementals 

This requires developing the heart, throat, and third eye chakras.
