The cause of error in science is the imposition of universal objectivity. 

The problem is that:
- Objectivity is from the negative force
- Existence is mostly positive and therefore subjective

So science itself is negative or evil (if we associate the Negative Force with evil). 


The cause of error in Western philosophy is the lack of samadhi among its leading philosophers.

By reading what is known from Thales to Hegel, it is obvious that very few Western philosophers have had samadhi or the direct experience of the Supreme Entity. 

Only the following seems to show symptoms of having experienced samadhi:

1. Pythagoras
2. Socrates
3. Descartes

Pythagoras was known to have some special power/s which support an enlightened state of mind. But these are way inferior to Asian philosophers from Patanjali to Ramakrishna and Yogananda. 



For example, Yogananda's account of Sri Yukteswar's lifetrons and astra and causal realms are essential in us coming up with the 5 metaphysical layers of causal, essential, astral, subtle, and crude. 

 <!-- spiritual technique which leads to spiritual tradition that sustains itself.  -->


The lack of samadhi in the West is from the lack of technique which is from the lack of a teacher. 

The main enlightened teacher in Western philosophy seemed to be Pythagoras. 

Jesus only taught for 3 short years, which is useless since metaphysical skills take years and even lifetimes to develop. 

In contrast, there are many gurus in Asia such as:
- Shiva
- Krishna
- Buddha
- Mahavira
- Patanjali
- Sikh gurus
- Taoist masters
- Yogananda
- Sai Baba
- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
- PR Sarkar
- etc

Buddha was known for both an original philosophy and for having various occult powers.

This is why advanced souls might choose to incarnate in India which has a relative abundnace of gurus to help advanced souls pick up where they left off in the past life.
