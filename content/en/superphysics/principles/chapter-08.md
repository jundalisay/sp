Everything already pre-exists in Existence as the Supreme Entity.

Therefore, everything is already known and all problems are already solved from the viewpoint of the Supreme as the perfected agent of the Absolute Entity.
- We call this the state of omniscience.

However, this perfected state is also worthless. 

This is why:
- the Negative Force keeps on disturbing the perfection
- the Positive Force keeps on realizing the value of that perfection


## Thinking Versus Knowing

Existence is made up of disturbances as waves and nodes. 

The integration of these nodes leads more and more to the state of Omniscience where all nodes are united as One.

Therefore:
- **thinking** is the process of integrating external idea-nodes within the mind-node -- this is an action of the higher mind
- **knowing** is the actual of integration of these idea-nodes -- this is an effect of the higher mind
- **thoughts** are the products of the thinking process as it grabs and processes ideas 
- **knowledge** is the product of the integration of these idea-nodes.

Genius is a mind that has enough subtlety to access the higher mind easily.

Stupidity is a mind that has no access to the higher mind and is confined to the lower mind. For example, a stupid mind would answer `1 + 1 = 11` because it has no access to a new idea of `2`. 


In terms of feeling-waves:
- **expression and feedback** is the process of integrating external and internal feeling-waves to create harmony
  - Expression is the Negative
  - Feedback and assimilation is the Positive
- **peace** is the actual integration of these feeling-waves to create harmony between the internal and external waves
 

<!-- Force is tasked with the return trip towards the origin, as a wave that has 4 properties: -->

<!-- The previous chapters explained that:
- Existence is in the mind for the purpose of being experienced by the perceiver or consciousness
- A mind can only be active or inactive, just as consciousness can only be be `on` or `off`
- Desire, as a type of feeling and effect of the Two Forces, is the engine for the creation of anything in existence 
- All Existence is then made up of ideas and feelings molded by the Two Forces
  - Ideas are sensed by the mind's intellect 
  - Feelings are sensed by the mind's heart  -->


In thinking, the mind-node adjusts its own configuration in order to match the structure or pattern of the nodes that flow through it.

This is because nodes are just bunched-up waves. And so they can recur just like waves do.  


## Thinking, Intuition, Learning, Memory

Thinking is the process of integrating external idea-nodes within the mind-node.

Intuition is the gettomg that actual integration with weak Positive aethereal energy.

<!-- 1. React

A crude node will react to the incoming node or wave by adjusting itself externally. This is seen in balls bouncing off the wall as they react to the crude contact force from that wall.  

2. Learn

A subtle node will "learn" from the incoming nodes by adjusting itself internally -- its wave-collection will adjust to match the contents of that small node or wave.

This is seen in the adaptations of living organisms.

3. Express -->



1. Thinking

This is similar to the manipulating the actors and props

2. Remembering: This is similar to props being stored and retrieved backstage 

3. Learning: This is similar to the improvement of the theater in the way it manipulates (thinks) and stores and retrieves its props (remembers) 

4. Expanding or Contracting: This is similar to the expansion of a theater in order to have better shows



## Thinking

The main job of the intellectual mind is to think about its ideas.
- The act of thinking is the perception and connection of ideas  

The main job of the emotional mind is to discern its feelings.
- The act of feeling is the perception and immersion of feelings

We then group this thinking operation into 2 categories:

<!-- From here, we can say that all of the activities or operations of the mind's intellect can be broadly categorized into two: -->

1. Adding or Combinative
2. Subtracting or Separative

We also group this feeling operation into 2 categories:
<!-- The activities or operations mind's heart can also be broadly categorized into two: -->

1. Attraction
2. Repulsion

Attraction has a combinative net effect just as repulsion has a separative one. 

Therefore the active mind, which thinks and feels, has 2 kinds of operations:
- Combination
  - This comes from the Positive Force
- Separation
  - This comes from the Negative Force

<!-- Note that memory is a quality of the mind, and not an operation. Remembering is part of the operations of consciousness, just as perception is.  -->

<!-- ## The Operations of Thinking  -->
<!-- the Intellect -->

<!-- "Adding" or "combination" is the integration of one identity to another to create a new third identity. This is an effect of the Positive Force (Yang or Shiva)

For example, we:
- add `1 + 1` to make `2` 
- put more rice grains in a bag to make it reach 1 kilogram for purchase
- step in an empty bus so it can get passengers and start its journey


"Subtracting" or "separation" is the removal of one part of an identity in order to create a new identity. This is an effect of the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti or Prakrti)

For example, we:
- subtract `3 - 1` to make `2`
- remove things from our luggage so that it will meet the limit of 15 kilograms 
- step out of an overloaded bus so that it can run safely


Related operations of thinking spring from these 2 broad operations:

Combination Category:
- Multiplication
- Exponents
- Memory or Remembering
- etc

Separation Category:
- Division and Fractions
- Square roots
- Ignorance or Forgetting
- etc -->
<!-- - Factorials and Multiples -->
