The previous section explained how advanced aliens have been documented consistently by ancient civilizations who did not talk to each other. 

The most detailed of these are from the Sumerian texts who call them the Anunnaki who created humans to work for them.

{{< q a="Enki" c="Epic of Atrahasis" >}}
Create a human being, that he bear the yoke. Let him bear the yoke, the task of Enlil. Let man assume the drudgery of the god.
{{< /q >}}


We call as the Anunnaki Hypothesis the idea that humans were created by the Anunnaki through genetic manipulation. 
- The Anunnaki dynamics will be studied by Social Superphysics
- Genetic manipulation will be studied by Bio Superphyiscs where the DNA are vortices created by the "spin" of the pineal gland or 7th chakra

This leads to the 4 races of humans:

1. African
2. Aryan
3. Mongolian
4. Austric

{{< q a="Kiche People" c="Popol Vu, Part 3, Chapter 2">}}
These are the names of the first men created:
1. Balam-Quitz√©
2. Balam-Acab
3. Mahucutah
4. Iqui-Balam
{{< /q >}}


This matches the 4 properties of waves, since evolution is driven by the wave of desire.



## The Oversoul and the Law of Diversity

There are currently 3 theories of evolution that matches either textual or genetic evidence:

1. Genetic Creationism

This was done by the Anunnaki on breed humans to do certain jobs, just as our animal and plant breeders breed their creations via "artificial selection". 

2. Darwinism

This believes that organisms evolve in order to survive via "natural selection"

3. Lamarckism 

This believes that organisms evolve by their will. This will creates changes in their physical structure. If both male and female have this will, then their offspring will have some of these changes. 

Lamarckism implies that successful evolution requires a desire by the oversoul of a species. This concept solves the main objection to Darwinism which is sterile worker ants. 

The oversoul (Chapter 5c) and the Law of Diversity (Chapter 1f) explain why hybrids and the interbreeding of brother and sister results in sterile offspring.

This supports the policy of racial intermarriages, most obviously seen in Eurasians, as producing healthier offspring due to:
- the reduction of genetic diseases
- increased diversity of the immune system

This goes against theories that support racial supremacy, such as the one from Adolf Hitler.

{{< q a="Adolf Hitler" c="Mein Kampf, Volume 1, Chapter 11" >}}
Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with the stronger. She wishes even less that a superior race intermingles with an inferior one.
{{< /q >}}



## Lamarck's Classification of Animals

We use Lamarck's 14 classes and add 2 subclasses for advanced alien mammals. 

Animals Without Vertebrae (Complex to Simple) | With Vertebrae
--- | ---
Mollusks | Mammals
Cirrhipeds | Birds
Annelids | Reptiles
Crustaceans | Fish
Arachnids |
Insects |
Worms |
Radiata |
Polyps |
Infusorians | 


## Evolution is by Desire

These theories, matched by reality, lead to evolution being a product of desire or willpower which has 2 kinds:

1. Evolution by the Will of the self or 1st person

2. Evolution by the Will of a 3rd person

These match the principle that desire is the cause of creation, as explained in Chapter 3c.

We call:
- Darwinism as the will from the Negative Force, focusing on survival
- Lamarckism as the will from the Positive Force, focusing on desire

{{< i s="/graphics/bio/evolve.jpg" a="Lamarck vs Darwin" c="Lamarckian Evolution is Positive, Darwinist Evolution is Negative" >}}


{{< q a="Lamarck" c="Zoological Philosophy, Chapter 5" >}}
The faculty of movement in the most imperfect animals evolves within the animal itself and finishes by being subject to the animal's willpower. 
{{< /q >}}


## So What's the Use of Desire-based Evolution?

On a personal level, Desire-based Evolution is consisten with the Law of Attraction which says that reality is based on desire, will or grit. 

So the minimum effect is empowerment. 

On a policy-level, it would encourage interracial marriages in order for the children to the gain benefits of genetic diversity.
