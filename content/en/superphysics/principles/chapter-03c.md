## Everything Starts from Desire

The previous section explained that desire is the cause of Existence, as the Absolute splitting Itself up in order to view Itself and thus appreciate Itself.

The only ingredient needed by the Creator to generate Existence is the **Desire** for It. 

We observe this in ourselves. Before we do anything, we have to want or need to do it. 

The longer we retain the desire for a thing, the longer we keep that thing. 

When we totally lose the desire for what we are doing, then we stop doing it. 

If we are passionate about what we do, then our actions reward us, giving incentives to keep us doing what we are doing.

Within Existence-Consciousness, this Desire becomes a Force that pushes aethereal ideas down the 4 Elements to make them physically real. 

If there were only 1 Force, then:
- all ideas would be converted into reality in no time
- Existence would turn static right away

It would be like us waking up with a desire to do just 1 thing and then going back to sleep for the rest of the day after we finish it. 

Yet we obviously see a lot of dynamism in our universe along with some staticity. 

Likewise, we ourselves are never satisfied to do just 1 thing in a day.


## The Positive and Negative

Therefore, there are 2 Forces in Existence-Consciousness to enable the transition from the Absolute One (Nirguna) to the Supreme Many (Saguna):

1. One to divide and separate the Supreme into parts -- we call this the Negative Force
2. Another to unify those parts back into the Supreme to create a great loop -- we call this the Positive Force

It is these 2 Forces that create disturbances in the 'flatline' of Pre-Existence to give it life as the dynamic waves Existence.   

Without these disturbances the Supreme Entity reverts to the peaceful Absolute Entity without Existence. This is the goal of Yoga. 

These 2 Forces are called:
- Yang and Yin in Taoism
- Shiva and Shakti in Hinduism
- Love and Strife in Empedocles' philosophy

{{< q a="Empedocles" c="On Nature" >}}
Love unites all into One. The same One is ripped through the hate of Strife. The One grows from the Many. The Many, again, springs from primeval scattering of the One.

{{< q a="Propery" c="The Life of Pythagoras by Propery" >}}
According to Pythagoras, the world was divided into opposite powers:
- the "one" was a better monad, light, right, equal, stable and straight
- the "other" was an inferior duad, darkness, left, unequal, unstable and movable

{{< q a="Hegel" c="The Phenomenology of Spirit" >}}
There are 2 forces present at the same time. The notion of both is the same notion. But it has passed out of its unity into duality...

The elements when set up as independent, pass directly over into their unity. Their unity passes directly into its explicit diversity. The diversity passes back once again into the reduction to unity.

These 2 Forces manifest in the material domain in the following forms:

Layer | Positive | Negative
--- | --- | ---
Aethereal | Unity | Division
Spacetime | Gravity | Dark Energy  
Radiant| Attraction | Repulsion
Convertible | Fusion (Stability) | Fission (Chemical Reaction)
Material | Solidity | Splitting up

<!-- Thus, attraction and repulsion are the effects of the 2 Forces. -->


### Duality from the Two Forces

The Negative force splits the theoretical Absolute Entity into a dualistic Creator, as the real Supreme Entity. This latter Entity creates Existence by making imperfections of Itself, as Its dualistic ideas and feelings:
- The creation of the idea of beauty also leads to the creation of ugliness. 
- The creation of order also leads to the creation of disorder. 
- The creation of tastiness also leads to the creation of blandness.


{{< q a="Parmenides" c="Parmenides Simplified by Plato" >}}
Since the One exists, then the Whole has the One and Existence as Its parts. Each of these parts have both the One and Existence as its parts and is at the least made up of two parts. The same principle goes on forever. 

Every part always has these two parts because existence always involves one, and one involves being, so that one is always disappearing, and becoming two. This makes the One infinite in multiplicity. The One has Existence and therefore exists, leading it to become many.
