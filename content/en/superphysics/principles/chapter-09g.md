The previous section explained how feelings, as feeling-waves, are caused by chakras as their origin.

These waves course from the chakras to different parts of the body for expression into the physical world. 

This is done through the medium of called the animal spirits, called chi in Taoism, and Vayu in Hinduism.

These are in the Spatial Layer and so are naturally invisible since visibility is a property of the Radiant Layer.

The main property of the Spatial Layer is force. This is why our feelings have force. 

<!-- Love as an idea, Love as as visible thing, Love as an ectual feeling -->

Besides the animal spirits, man consists of spiritual air-aether which is homogeneous with our animal spirit, and watery humor, homogeneous with the solid parts that can be compared to the earth-aether

## How to Fix Bad Feelings

Bad Feelings are waves of a certain waveform. 

These can be fixed by:

1. Cancelling them out with an opposite waveform. 

We get a negative feeling such as when our work is criticized and seen as ugly.

This can be relieved by getting a positive feeling where our work, or something about ourself, is praised and called beautiful. 

The positive wave cancels out the negative wave.

2. Preventing waves from becoming bad qualitatively or quantitatively (volumetrically)
 <!-- or gaining negativity  -->

Bad feelings get their "badness" from the difference with the current gravitational signature of the ego. 

For example, a traffic jam is not so bad for a passenger who is reading a good book, but it really bad for a passenger who has to get to work on time. It can even be positive for a passenger of a bus who is watching his favorite movie on the bus' screen.
