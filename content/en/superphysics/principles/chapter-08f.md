In `1 + 1 = 2`, the mind sweeps from the left to the right. 

But in `(1 + 1) :: 2`, the mind splits itself into the left and the right. 

It becomes an impartial spectator of both sides or states, an idea developed by Adam Smith, as a manifestation of relationality:


{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments, Part 3, Chapter 1" >}}
I divide myself into 2 persons whenever I examine my own conduct. The first "I" is the judge. The second I is myself, as the agent and the person judged.
{{< /q >}}


The ratio sign stops the mindless one way flow from one side to the other, which now manifests as a "shut up and calculate" mentality which shows the Materialist Disease. 


## Examples

The formula of economist John Maynard Keynes for money supply `M` as being affected by liquidity preference `L` and interest rate `r` is:

```elixir
M = Lr
```

This becomes:


```elixir
M :: (L : r)
```

when deconstructed:

```elixir
money_supply :: (liquidity_preference : interest-rate)
```

This translates to "the money supply is totally dependent on the love of cash and the profits in lending (or cost of borrowing) cash"



Likewise, Newton's gravity changes from 

```elixir
F = (Gm1m2)/r^2
```

into


```elixir
F :: (G (m1/r^2 : m2/r^2))
```


Notice how this isolates Newton's `G` away from the two masses being compared. 

We then deconstruct it in Cartesian Physics further:

<!-- `gravity between objects :: Gravitational_limiter (Mass1 / distance_between_them ^ 2 : Mass2 / distance_between_them ^ 2)` -->
<!-- material-layer-gravitational-signature -->

```elixir
gravity_between :: (material_layer_limiter (matter_amount_in_identity1 / distance_between^2 : matter_amount_in_identity2 / distance_between^2)
```

This translates as "the pushing force of spacetime between 2 material identities depends on the quantity and quality of matter in them and their distance from each other."

In future posts, we can apply the same technique to Maxwell's equations to show how the spacetime, radiant, and material layers work together to create Electromagnetism.  


In price equations, this will allow us to more easily remove the influence of interest rates (of the financial system) and taxes (of the government) in order to reveal the natural price ratios from their own perspective. 

The gravity, interest rates, and taxes enter their own abstraction called a *limiter*. Notice how this system does not require PEMDAS because of the allowance for mind-splitting behavior.


## Math with a Practical and Moral Purpose Inspired by Al-Khwarizmi and Descartes


The above decontstructed equation "`gravity_between`" gives us 2 benefits:

1. Practical: It helps us *code* the equation more easily into procedures and algorithms
2. Moral: It makes us think of `Mass1` and `Mass2` independently, and separate from its limiter

Quali-math is inspired by **Al-Khwarizmi** who invented algebra from his work on "Calculation by Completion and Balancing". 

The practical purpose leads to algorithms, the invention of which has likewise been attributed to Al-Khwarizmi*.

{{< n n="*The original purpose of Algebra (Al-Jebra or 'the repair or healing') was to divide an estate and compute the inheritance due to each heir. <!-- The Europeans seemed to have used it for warmaking --> This matches the problem-solving nature of Superphysics. This is opposite of Einstein's math as sophistical tensors coming from his wild imagination which creates more problems. It is also different from Newton's Calculus which originated from plotting curvilinear motion. Superphysics allows teleportation which totally negates curvilinear motion." >}}
   

An algorithm is an implementation or processing of a model. This processing is automated by computers as machine learning, which is the automation of natural intelligence, which is wrongly called artificial intelligence. We call it properly as [Automated Natural Intelligence](/superphysics/solutions/isaiah) (ANI) and is one of the goals of Superphysics.


Qualimath will allow an AI-driven* ship that teleports into another universe, which has different physics, to transpose its logic and definitions more easily to match that universe. This is because it uses quality instead of quantity.

{{< n n="*The mind-splitting behavior in Qualimath can be implemented with computers with multiple independent cores (Update 2024: This is now done by GPUs which have multiple cores). In humans, this is naturally done in families and societies. The family mind is split between the father, mother and children. The society's mind is split between the different classes represented by political parties and special-interest groups. This is why we can readily apply Qualimath to Social Superphysics to make predictions in economics and politics." >}}

  
 

A qualitative definition in oneâ€™s mind retains itself even if its mind moves into another universe. *This is because that defintion is always anchored in the ego (feeling of the self) of that mind.* This was implied by Adam Smith:

{{< q a="Adam Smith" c="Theory of Moral Sentiments" >}}
I can only fairly compare those big objects and the small objects near me by transporting myself in fancy, to a place from where I can survey both at equal distances, and judge their real proportions.
{{< /q >}}

{{< img src="/graphics/movement.png" alt="Superphysics Movement" cap="Qualimath uses Poincare's Law of Relativity which uses aethereal state-change instead of Einstein's Relativity which uses tensors" >}}



Because of this, Qualimath also creates moral effects. It conditions minds to respect the identity and natures of all sides (other egos), instead of bulldozing over them with arbitrary notations and movement towards one side as what Westerners tend to do. 

While the practical aspect is based on [Al-Khwarizmi](/research/musa/algebra/chapter-01), this moral aspect is based on Rene Descartes who invented exponents and the Cartesian plane, among others, from his realizations on how the mind works*, as well as David Hume from whom Adam Smith got his ideas.


<!-- This is in line with the Hindus inventing zero to represent the existence of nothingness. Rather, zero implies that space is empty *but is actually meant by Nature to be filled* (since Nature abhors a vacuum). The Romans and the ancient Chinese did not have such an advanced metaphysical concept. Aristotle had, but did not seem to deploy it into reality.

Qualimath also bridges modern math, which 'prefers' single integers or the small picture or 'micro', with ancient Egyptian math, which 'prefers' the large view or 'macro'. Thus, it harmonizes the different ways of looking at existence, making it more flexible and dynamic:

- Modern math from the micro going macro
- Ancient Egyptian math from the macro going micro
- Hindu (Vedic) math grouping and scaling identities via zero
