Instead, of specific religions, we come up with 4 paths to yoga which is consistent with the 4 paths in the Bhagavad Gita. 



Aetheareal is the 5th Layer 

Spiritual is the goal of the Supreme where there is both no activity. Saguna Brahma is all of existence.  

Enlightenment is 

Getting out of the house. 

The mall has an opening time and a closing time. 

Spirituality is like walking on the road to the goal

Most peole will want to go back inside their house where it is safe and life is easy.


Technically, to go beyond the 4 elements into the 5th where there is no staticity. 


State Policy should be to allow everyone to take that path. It will not force people to take that path. But it will just let them get an experience of it during their teenage years. 

This is to gauge whether a soul is advanced or not.
