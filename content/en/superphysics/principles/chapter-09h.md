Earlier we divided the actions of the mind into 3 to match the 3 gunas or influences:

1. Flow
2. Force
3. Memory

We likewise divide the existence of the mind into 3 to match the 3 gunas:

<!-- A mind that exists in the physical domain has 3 aspects: -->

1. Physicality

This is the physical parts that connect to the lower mind
<!-- 5 Biological Elements -->

2. Mental

This is the lower mind.

3. Spiritual

This is the higher mind.


Each mind has a configuration called personality structure that manifests as one's personality. 


{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 5" >}}
The activating (radiating) capacity of the ego determines physical activity (primarily) and one’s personality. The more developed the radiating power, the more glaring will be one’s personality.

## Harmonizing Personalities: Love Versus Money, Heart Versus Intellect

A common philosophical question asked by young people is whether to go for love or money, or follow the heart or the intellect.

- Romantic people and idealists will go for love and heart
- Pratical people and materialists will go for money and intellect

The proper answer is to know the personality structure of the people.
- If the person is idealist, then he will accept the answer of love and heart.  
- If the person is idealist, then he will accept the answer of money and intellect.

However, since our goal is to unify and balance the pepole in society then the better answer is:
- love and heart for idealists, but the advantage or benefit of practicality and intellect should be planted
- money and intellect for materialists, but the advantage or benefit of love and heart should be planted
