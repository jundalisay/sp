The nature of the Negative is to divide | A soul can have many selves but a self can only have one soul
The Soul or Mind is the Positive Force Surrounded by the Negative | If a perception is 1 second, then there are 3 billion selves in a 100 year lifetime 
The Soul is split into different Selves by the Spacetime Layer |

Chapter 5 defined "identity" as a discrete resultant perception separate from other perceptions.
- This discreteness comes from the separation created by the Negative Force on the parts of the Supreme Entity. 

Chapter 4 explained that the Negative Force not only separates identities form each other, but also creates identities of spacetime from the totality of space and time. 


We call these independent spacetime identities as spacetime slices.

The parts of timespan are not mutually dependent and are never co-existent. We exist now. But it does not follow that we will exist in the next moment unless the cause of our existence, as God, keeps on sustaining us. This means that God sustains himself.
{{< /q >}}



**This means that each identity in each moment of time is an independent and different entity from all its past and future.** 

This fulfills the Law of Conservation of Idea that says there is no exact duplicates in Existence. 


For example, a pyramid without a capstone is different from the same pyramid that has it. However, most humans do not regard it as different. They only see it as different if a large part of the pyarmid is removed. 

{{< img src="/photos/objects/egypt.jpg" alt="Pyramids without capstones" cap="Pyramids without capstones" >}}

This was asserted by David Hume who wrote that each person or thing is different from itself in past times.


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 4" >}}
The addition or reduction of a mountain would not be enough to produce a diversity in a planet. But the change of a very few inches can destroy the identity of some bodies. This means that objects break the continuity of the mind's actions according to their proportion to each other, and not according to the size of the objects. This interruption makes an object cease to appear the same.

He gives the following examples:

- A ship that has been repaired is a different ship from itself when it was new. However, human mind makes a convention to see it as the same ship.
- A mountain that has some dirt from it removed is a different mountain from the original one. However, the human mind sees it as the same mountain.
- An oak seed is a different plant from the oak tree that it grows into. However, the human mind sees it as the same oak.
- A baby that has grown into a man was a different person from that man. However, the human mind sees it as the same person.


Likewise, people see that a person has changed only if something big has changed in him. But to Hume, every change in the person means that he is a new person. 

{{< img src="/graphics/bio/obama.jpg" alt="Obama changing" cap="A change of identity is normally perceiveable with big changes and after a long time. But Hume insists that each change, no matter how small, changes the identity." >}}


However, we do not normally regard people as being different from themselves per unit of time because it would overwhelm our minds to have to remember all the instances of a person per second. 


## Each Person Has 3 Billion Selves

To illustrate how difficult it would be to remember all identities, let us assume that a seed sprouts 5 millimeters daily for 3 days. Each time we see it grow, we assign a new name to it to create a natural diversity:

 Name | Height | Day
--- | --- | ---
Allan seed | 0mm | 1
Bob plant | 5mm | 2
Charlie plant | 10mm | 3
Dan plant | 15mm | 4

Doing so would be information-and-memory-overload for us. To save us from such an effort, we simply assign a single name or identity to the plant during its lifetime. 

<!--  classify one tree into different versions of the same tree with every single change in it, and then retain them in memory for comparison.  -->

If we applied this system to humans, then a 20-year old man will not only have 20 selves and not even 7,300 selves (20 * 365), but 630,720,000 selves if his smallest perception is in seconds! If humans live for 100 years, then each human soul will experience 3,153,600,000 selves in a lifetime, and even more if we can naturally perceive milliseconds and remember what happened in each millisecond.

{{< img src="/photos/psych/schizo.jpg" cap="A soul can have many selves (instances). This is most evident among Westerners who have a liberalized culture and not so much in Asian culture where the selves are controlled by tradition" alt="crazy">}}


This dynamic idea of the self is very important because it is the basis of morals.

- When applied to mental health, this explains the root cause of personality disorders such as split personality. 
- When applied to society, it explains social cycles or why revolutions, civil war, recessions, financial crises happen. We can say that a civil war is the fight between the two personalities of a single society.


## Identity, Self, Ego, Soul

An **identity** is a discrete resultant perception separate from other perceptions.

A **self** is an identity that perceives itself.

**Ego** is the feeling of the self. 

**Soul** is a mind that is regarded without its crude parts

And so identity, self, and ego are relate to the Negative Force, whereas soul relates to the Positive.

This is why ego in the operating universe is called the Negative Ego because its continued existence implies the constant dominance of the Negative. 

A self that that triumphs over the Negative will lose his ego and feel one with others.

The unification of selves happens in the upper limites of Existence, which is realized through samadhi.

A self that that absorbs or loses to the Negative will become egotistic.

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Essay on Wisdom" >}}
Men, who are great lovers of themselves, waste the public. They divide people with reason, between self-love and society.. The ego is a poor centre of a man's actions.

## The Negative Ego as the Cause of All Problems

Each soul has many selves which can be in conflict or harmony with each other. 
- A soul with many conflicting selves will have many mental problems
- A soul with many harmonious selves will be in peace


This is why the Negative Ego is the cause of all problems, yet is also the cause of physical experience.

To make physicality less unpleasant, the selves of the soul should be in Unity and Harmony.

There are 2 main ways to keep the selves in check and keep harmony:

1. Group Feeling checks the personal ego

However, this also creates a group ego that might clash with other group egos. 

2. The Supreme Ego

The Supreme Entity as the best check against the egos. This is why a social moral system that has no idea of the Supreme Entity will eventually fail or have problems.
