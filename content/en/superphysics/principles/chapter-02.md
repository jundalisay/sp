<!-- The Microlayers are the quantum subdivisions within the aethereal layer -->


Chapter 1 explained that reality is divided into the Physical and Metaphysical Domains. 

We defined reality as the metaphysical structure that forms from the waves emanated by nodes or vortices on each other. This is similar to an entity-relationship diagram.

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/er.jpg" a="ER Diagram" c="" >}}


This means that perception is the basis of reality. Since our perceptions are either physical or metaphysical, then there can be both physical and metaphysical reality.

<!-- We therefore expand the word “reality”, which comes from the Latin word “res” meaning “things”, to include both physical and metaphysical phenomena.  -->


Having only 2 kinds of reality accounts for all phenomena whether physical of metaphysical. But it does not explain the details or dynamics behind those phenomena. 

To get more accuracy with minimum complexity, we subdivide reality into 5 Elements as what was done by the ancient Greeks, Indians, and Chinese. 


Rank | Name | Greek | Hindu | Chinese | Vietnamese 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1 | Aethereal | Aether | Akasha | 水 (still water) | Thủy  
2 | Spatial | Air | Vayu | 木 (moving wood) | Mộc 
3 | Radiant | Fire | Tejas | 火 (expanding fire) | Hỏa  
4 | Convertible | Water | Jala | 土 (changing earth) | Thổ
5 | Material | Earth | Pritvi | 金 (solid metal) | Kim


Currently, Modern Physics knows only 3 of these 5 Elements as the Strong, Weak, and Electromagnetic Forces. 

Superphysics | Physics 
--- | ---  
Aethereal | Pseudo-science  
Spatial | Gravitation 
Radiant | Electromagnetic Force  
Convertible | Weak Force
Material | Strong Force


This is because physicists impose a limitation on themselves to ignore or avoid metaphysical perceptions like ideas, feelings, and spirits. This in turn is because their minds favor the material and crude perceptions as being universal or common to all. 


## The Forces Have A Hierarchy

Section 1b explained that the metaphysical is superior to the physical since physicality itself is the effect of metaphysicality. 

This manifests in the 5 Elements as the upper Elements being superior to the lower ones. 

For example, Modern Physics tells us that:
- gravity can affect light, but light cannot affect gravity 
- electromagnetism can affect iron, but ordinary iron does not exert electromagnetism
- a mass of iron can exert a small amount of gravity, but not enough to affect light 

It follows that the forces have a hierarchy, wherein:
- gravity is superior to light (electromagnetism)
- electromagnetism is superior to matter (strong force)
- dark energy as the atomic space (which we call the aetherspace) is superior to gravity

<!-- These layers are the effect of the fight between the Positive and Negative Forces to be discussed in Chapter 3. We can say that reality is an arena for the fight between them.
- The journey from Pure Positivity to Pure Negativity is called *crudification*, which creation is part of
- The journey from Pure Negativity to Pure Postivity is called *subtilification*, which discovery is part of

Both creation and discovery are part of existence or reality -- you create something then discover or learn its uses, then create something new and so on.

{{< i s="/graphics/super/operative.svg" a="The 5 Layers of Superphysics" c="The 5 Layers, 5 Elements, 5 Strata are similar but different. The 5 Layers are for Physical Phenomena. The 5 Elements are for Living Phenomena. The 5 Strata are for Mental and Spiritual Phenomena. The Mental-Spiritual is Superior to the Physical" >}}
 -->

We then list the 5 Elements according to rank in Nature.



### The 5 Elements is an Atheist Belief 

Bacon and Descartes clearly did not believe in a dominating personal God, as proven by Bacon's own essay: 

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" >}}
"For it is a thousand times more credible, that four mutable elements, and one immutable fifth essence, duly and eternally placed, need no God, than that an army of infinite small portions, or seeds unplaced, should have produced this order and beauty, without a divine marshal"
{{< /q >}}

The 5 Layers are Atheist in the sense that all layers and particles are 'programmed' and do not need an overseer. 

Socrates promoted the Elements paradigm of Timaeus and was executed because of his atheism. 

<!-- However, they are Theist in the sense that a program needs a programmer.  -->

This is opposite of the Theist Universe of Isaac Newton:

{{< q a="Newton" >}}
"This most beautiful system [of the universe] can only come from an intelligent and powerful Being.. This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the universe, but as Lord overall. I call Him Lord God or Universal Ruler"
{{< /q >}}
