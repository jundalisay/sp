Chapter 7 explained that the physical universe or domain is the body of the Supreme Being, while the metaphysical universe is Its collective mind.

- Material Superphysics is the study of that body
- Bio Superphysics is the study of how that body interacts with its mind
- Social Superphysics is the study of how that mind works a collective
- Spiritual Superphysics is the study of how to go to the center of that mind


We then match this organization of study with the current ones: 

<!-- This likewise led to the concept of Material Superphysics as the sub-aspect of Superphysics to study that body. From this, we can organize Superphysics relative to Science: -->


Parts of Existence | Modern Version | Our Version 
--- | --- | ---
Absolute Entity (Pre-Existence) | Philosophy | Metaphysics
Supreme Entity (as a Concept) | Religion | Superphysics 
Supreme Entity (Mind) | Psychology | Social and Bio Superphysics
Supreme Entity (Body) | Science (with Physics as the core) | Bio and Material Superphysics


This physical universe is the subject of study of Material Superphysics just as the Supreme Entity is the subject of Superphysics.

<!-- , and the Absolute Entity is the subject of Metaphysics.   -->


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
All Philosophy is like a tree. Metaphysics is the root. Physics the trunk. All the other sciences are the branches that grow out of this trunk. We gather fruit from the extremities of the branches of trees, not from the roots or the trunks.
{{< /q >}}


The subdivision of Superphysics into 3 matches the division made by Descartes:

<!--  is the 'trunk' from which emerges 3 main sciences: 

1. Material Superphysics
2. Bio Superphysics
3. Social Superphysics -->


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principles of Philosophy, Preface" >}}
There are 3 principal sciences:
1. Medicine
2. Mechanics
3. Ethics
{{< /q >}}

<!-- The science of Morals is the highest and most perfect. Presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences, it is the last degree of wisdom. -->

We add Spiritual Superphysics to learn the source Itself, which is taboo in the dogmatic religions of Christianity and Islam.


## What is Superphysics?

Superphysics is the system of knowledge and study that abides by the main principles from the previous chapters:

Chapter | Principle
--- | ---
1 | The 2 Domains; Waves
2 | The 5 Elements
3 | Absolute, Supreme, 2 Forces, Cycles from 2 Forces
4 | Densities, Dimensions
5 | Ideas, Conservation, Geometry of Ideas
6 | Karma, Spin, Relationality
7 | Life, Elementals, Aliens, Evolution
8 | Thinking, Qualimath, Socratic Dialectics
9 | Feelings, Ego, Chakras, Law of Attraction
10 | Society, Group Feeling, Morality, Justice
11 | Spirituality 
12 | Superphysics


{{< i s="/graphics/super/super.jpg" a="Superphysics concepts" c="Superphysics can be summed up as a discipline that deals with the Supreme Entity or Existence" >}}


In a nutshell, using our own defintions:
- Superphysics is a discipline using an organized set of principles that explains how Existence works. It is the result of Socratic Dialetics
- Socratic Dialectics is **the method that exhaustively probes and merges the known and proven perceptions (evidence) of the physical and metaphysical domains (Chapters 1-2, 8) in order to find patterns (Chapters 3-5) and principles (Chapters 6-9) for the sake of solving problems in Existence (restore things to the dharma)**
- Socratic Dialectics uses induction and deduction for thoughts, and discernment and ideation for feelings, adding energy though critical out-of-the box thinking and critical out-of-the-self feeling 


<!-- - Superphysics becomes a belief system if an ego attaches to it. It becomes an organized belief if a group of egos attaches to it. -->

We avoid the word "science" as it implies a rejection of the metaphysical

We avoid the word "philosophy" as it implies a lack of evidence and replicability.

We avoid the word "belief" or "ideology" as it implies something not universal.

We instead use the word "discipline" just as engineering, law, music, and the sciences are disiplines which based on real practice. 


<!--  paradigm that sees the universe or reality as being made up of 2 Forces and 5 Layers. 

Superphysics is the paradigm that sees the universe as being made up of waves. -->

This combination of science and metaphysics will be opposed by materialists and so we push forward and ignore them totally. Instead, we use Nature as our arbiter -- our principles and predictions must match physical reality.  

{{< q a="Blavatsky" >}}
A minority strive to enlarge the domain of Physical Science by trespassing on the forbidden grounds of Metaphysics, so distasteful to some Materialists.
