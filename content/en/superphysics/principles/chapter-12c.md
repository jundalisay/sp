The Superphysics Direction shapes up the human species to prepare us for employment in service of the universe. 


We put the materialist fallacies front and center, such as:
- matter dictating life (according to Karl Marx)
- life being a survival of the fittest (according to Charles Darwin)
- gravity coming from mass
- Einstein being a genius (according to modern physicsists).

We counter them with natural truths like:
- mentality creating reality (according to George Berkeley and David Hume)
- life being an expression of will or desire (according to Lamarck)
- gravity coming from spirit (according to Isaac Newton) or the aether (according to Rene Descartes and Spinoza)
- Einstein being a genius scammer (according to Nikola Telsa)
