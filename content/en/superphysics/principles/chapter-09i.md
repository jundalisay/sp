The Law of Conservation of Idea in Chapter 5 explained how Existence is a single entity. This leads to:
- uniqeness
- the other conservation laws
- dynamic movement
- constants
- relationality

This dynamic movement is an effect of the attraction and repulsion of gravitational signatures:
- perserving their uniqueness
- keeping constant expression

This is most easily seen in:
- physical gravitation and magnetism
- the love and hate between people and groups

<!-- like attracts like and contradictory qualities repel. Yet we see in magnetism that oppsites attract and like charges repel.

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Human Society Is One and Indivisible" >}}
From atoms and molecules to human beings with developed consciousness, all entities feel attraction for one another.. This is why attraction is the law of nature. Repulsion is negative attraction. The so-called differences that between human beings in the external world are merely expressions of negative attraction. For differences to occur, people must enter into some sort of relationship with each other. Without close proximity, there cannot be any friction. A serious difference of opinion today may be changed into friendship tomorrow. Thus, instead of reacting to apparent differences, one should seek internal unity. The points of affinity have got to be encouraged, the differences must be discouraged. No difference lasts long.

This concept of Attraction beyond physical magnetism and gravity has been developed in the 2000s.
