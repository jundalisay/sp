Chapter 9e explained that a soul has billions of selves. We can call this as the space-time division of the mind.

Chapter 8 explained that the mind has 3 **actions** to match the 3 gunas or influences:

1. Flow
2. Force
3. Memory

We likewise divide the **existence** of the mind into 3 to match the 3 gunas:

<!-- A mind that exists in the physical domain has 3 aspects: -->

1. Physicality

This is the physical parts that connect to the lower mind. This is really from the oversoul of the human species. 
<!-- 5 Biological Elements -->

2. Mental

This is the lower mind.

3. Spiritual

This is the higher mind. Both higher and lower mind is from the soul. 


When combined with the space-time division of the mind to create 



## Person, Personality, Personality Structure

A **person** is an individual human being. Each person has a mind which in turn has a configuration called personality structure that manifests as the person's personality.

A **personality** is the result of the combination of the physical mind, lower mind, and higher mind.  

A **personality structure** is cause of the manifest personality arising from the accumulated beliefs imposed and samskaras gained.

The activating (radiating) capacity of the ego determines physical activity (primarily) and one’s personality. The more developed the radiating power, the more glaring will be one’s personality.

## Each Person has 3 Billion Selves which are Fluid

In Hinduism, the jivatman is a tiny-soul that loses its identity when it is absorbed into the larger universal-soul, similar to a water in a glass losing its identity or self when it is poured into the sea. 

Conversely, the water in the sea (paramatman) can be turned into billions of new entities or identities (jivas) by taking a billion cups and scooping the water into each, in order to create 1 billion seas-in-a-cup (jivatmans). 


{{< i s="/photos/objects/water.jpg" a="Cup of water" >}}

  
Instead of water and seas, Hume gives the example of a citizens and republics, wherein each citizen is a 'drop' or member of the bigger sea of humans:


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1 Part 4 Section 6" >}}
I can only compare the soul to a republic with several members united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination. This gives rise to other persons who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts. The same republic may change its members, laws, and constitutions.  
{{< /q >}}


In Bio Superphysics, Hume's idea of the self leads to complex personality types, as well as personality disorders, depending on how united or disunited the selves are.  

In Social Superphysics, it naturally leads to the idea of the society-organism which has its own dynamics, just as water in a cup has different dynamics than water in the ocean. For example, water in a cup does not have waves nor any variation in saltiness or mineral content, whereas ocean-water has waves and a varying amount of minerals.

This has the following implementations in the different sciences:


Science | Effect
--- | ---
Material Superphysics | It destroys the grandfather paradox because if you go back in time to kill yourself as a child, you are actually *killing a different entity*. This means that your current self will stay alive, but your child-self will die
. | It allows the possibility of multiverses which have different copies of the self.
Bio Superphysics | It gets to the root causes of personality disorders
Supersociology | Death penalty and imprisonment would be applied differently because the person who committed the crime is a different entity from the one serving the jail time
Supereconomics | Sanctions on erring countries will also be different because the Kim Jong Un that met Trump in 2019 is a different entity from the Kim Jong Un that started in 2011
. | Laws should not guarantee the lifetime ownership of assets and property because the entity that deserved it in the beginning might not be deserving later on*. 


{{< n n="Hume’s best friend Adam Smith writes about this in *The Wealth of Nations* and *Lectures in Jurisprudence* where he denounces the ban on the division and sale of lands and the laws that create monopoly too-big-to-fail corporations" >}}


<!-- We could view the Earth as a Multiverse with the following universes: the United Nations as Universe 1, G20 as Universe 2, League of Nations as Universe 3 -->
  <!-- - Comintern as Universe 4. Each country-republic (representing the 3 billion self-citizens) would then have a different representative in each assembly or Universe  -->


## Personality Disorders 

Personality Disorders arise from the lack of harmony or unity between:
- the selves in space and time
- the 3 minds that make up the personality

Psychology classifies up to 20 mental disorders which we classify into lower mind and physical mind

The errors with the Physical Mind are from physical damage or bad development of the bodily machine.

The errors with the Lower Mind are from the past karma or actions that have molded the soul into a certain shape. Errors in the shape manifests as mental disorders and traumas or mania.

The most common problems afflict the lower mind because of the belief systems that is being imposed by the current materialist society.

## Preventing and Curing Mental Illness

The main cause of purely mental illness is the wrong shape that the mind has taken through its actions either in the past life or the habits of the current life.  

The main cause of body-mind illness is some problem with the nerves or appearance of the body or the funcitoning of some organs. 

For example, a physical defect such as cleft lip might create depression or anxiety. Body-mind illnesses can be usually cured by operating on the physical error.
