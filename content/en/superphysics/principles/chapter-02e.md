<!-- ## The Convertible Layer -->

This is responsible for the diversity in the universe whether mental, biological, or material. 

The Chinese invented gunpowder by using the principles of change of the Water Element. 

In Material Superphysics, this is called the Convertible Layer which is responsible for 'flavor changing' or changing the nature of particles.

For example, neutrinos are part of the Convertible Layer and are detected in liquids such as argon. 

In Bio Superphysics, the Water Element is the blood, lymph, and sperm which create the diversity in the realm of human biology.

In Spiritual Superphysics, this is the creative aspect based on the Sex Chakra.
