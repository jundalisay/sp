Chapter 5c explained how nodes, as ideas, have an inherent ability to connect to each other because they are really made up of flowing waves. 

This leads to a natural pyramid structure for complex ideas where the essence or core idea is at the center or top, and the sub-ideas are below and farther from the center.

This is explained by Parmenides and by Eastern Philosophy as the .

{{< q a="Parmenides" c="Parmenides by Plato, Chapter 2" >}}
The One itself, then, having been broken up into parts by being, is many and infinite. This means that not only the One which has being is many, but the One itself, distributed by being, must also be many

{{< q a="Sarkar" c="Idea and Ideology, Chapter 1" >}}
Since the mind exists, the mental plate exists, and the reflection of Paramatman must remain. The Átman, therefore, remains associated with the jiivátman. The ultimate knowership, doership and base of existence lie in the átman.

## Society, Nation, State, Civilization, Ideology

‘**Society**’ comes from the Latin socius which means companion which is an abstract term.
- This is consistent with our defintion of society as a metaphysical organism made up of individual organisms having a common interest
- This is also applicable to multicellular organisms, plants, animals, and aliens. 


‘**Nation**’ comes from the Latin natus which refers to birth. Thus, a nation can have 2 meanings:

1. The place where a person was born – this leads to nationality
2. The genetic ethnicity of the person at birth – this leads to ‘Cherokee nation’ if one’s parents are both Cherokee
State

The first defintion is more common and so we adopt it, being based on spatial location or territory instead of genetics.

A **state** as a society that is unified with laws and is therefore non-arbitrary.
- Its opposites are kingdoms, tribes, and nations, which are arbitrary.
- Unlike a nation that has physical attributes like area and borders, a state is an abstract idea.

A state has derivative ideas:
- A nation-state is a collection of ethnic tribes that has evolved to govern itself.
- A city-state is a city that has defined its society.
- A state can merge with other states and become a United States or European Union, or split up like former Soviet states. The next evolution is the global state.

A state can become a **civilization** if it adopts an ideology. 

The physical manifestations that a state is capable of ideology is when they have all of the following:

1. A refined culture represented by dress and music
2. A means to communicate, represented by script
3. Technology, represented by the wheel
4. Regular food production, represented by agriculture

Societies that do not have these ingredients are nations or tribes. 

An **ideology** as a belief system that has a specific, central idea, as opposed to a belief that is a network of ideas. For example:

- Nazi ideology is based on the supremacy of the Aryans
- Islamic ideology is based on the idea of submission to Allah
- Confucian ideology is based on Confucius’ policies and rituals

Therefore, a civilization implies intellectual advancement as to have a hierarchy of ideas, mutually connected to cause and effect.

Being civilized means that you know your actions have an effect in space and time, and so you are more cognizant of your actions unlike barbarians and savages who do not think of consequences.

**Culture** is the personality of a society-organism just as a single organism has his own personality.

Savages, Barbarians, and Civilizations all have culture.

Animals have individual personality. But animal societies do not have a culture since their society is for hunting or basic life processes which do not have a unified unique expression

 <!-- can be achieved mechanistically without any personality. -->
