Chapter 8b explained the 3 Actions of the Mind and the 4 Operations of Thinking.


## 3 Actions of the Feeling-Mind

We list the feeling version of the 3 Actions of the mind compared to the thinking version:

Action | Thinking Example | Feeling Example
--- | --- | ---
Flow | Moving from an idea to another | Having feelings spread between people  
Force | Being attracted or repulsed by an idea | Positive of Negative Feelings
Memory | Short or Long term | Trauma versus joyful memories


1. Flow

The most common action of the feeling-mind is flow which lets us:
- feel differently at different times
- feel the feelings of others and vice versa
  - This is easily seen when we see someone cry or laugh. 

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 3, Part 3, Section 1" >}}
The minds of all men are similar in their feelings and operations. We are all affected to some degree by what affects others. In wound-up strings, the motion of one string communicates itself to the rest. In the same way, all affections:
- readily pass from one person to another, and
- beget correspondent movements in every human creature.

2. Force

This is most obvious with strong emotions that oppose each other. This has been explained in depth by various philosophers in various way. 

Our innovation is to:
- distill the forces of the feelings just as we distilled the forces of Physics through our Medium-Substance-Quanum model.    
- apply Descartes' Rules of Motion onto the feelings


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 2, Part 1, Section 2" >}}
Pride and humility happen alternately depending on their causes. If these 2 encounter, the stronger one annihilates the other. Only the superior one continues to operate on the mind.

3. Memory

This is seen in either extremely Negative experiences that lead to trauma, or Positive ones that lead to joy. This is the cause of personality disorders such as:
- Antisocial behavior
- Obsessive-compulsive behavior
- Schizophrenia



## The 4 Operations of Feeling

Chapter 8b explained the 4 operations of thinking-mind based on David Humeâ€™s Relations which we distilled into 4. We use the same 4 for the feeling-mind.

1. Identity

This is Property 1 of waves as commonality. This packages our feelings into emotions as explained in the previous section.

2. Resemblance

This is Property 2 of waves as frequency or vibration. This is the affinity or discord between ideas to those in the personality.

This connects to the 2nd Action as force. This is why we are attracted and repulsed by various objects.

This also leads to the variations between the different feelings such as:
- Brotherly Love
- Friendship
- Love for Parents
- Romantic Love
- Love for Pets
- etc


3. Quantity and Quality

This is Property 3 as strength. This manifests as the ego which has a configuration called a personality. This actually processes feelings according to our beliefs.

4. Space and Time

This is Property 4 as spread. This makes the feelings connect to other feeling-entities automatically. This connects to the 1st Action as Commonality.


The other abilities of the mind can be explained in Bio Superphysics. 

<!-- Attraction is the tendency to move towards an object. 
Repulsion is the tendency to move away an object. 

- Hate
- Animosity
- War
- Isolation
- Selling
- Leaving
- Divorce or Breaking up
- etc -->

<!-- ### Usefulness of Combinative and Separative

All the operations of thinking and feeling thus fall into those 2 categories. This categorization is very useful for understanding the root cause of mental problems. 

For example, Modern psychology detaches the intellect from the heart when dealing with memory problems such as dementia or Alzheimer's. This makes its cause unknown. 

However, with our combined model, we point out that intellectual memory loss is separative action of the mind, as forgetting. The solution is to counteract this intellectual separative action with a combinative feeling action (since feelings are superior to intellect).

This manifests as people having better social bonds. This is why positive social interaction is essential to avoid Alzheimer's and other mental diseases.     

This categorization system also works for Physics as artificial intelligence or AI. 

For example, Physicists are unable to create real AI because they neglect the feeling aspect. We solve this by adding social interaction data as part of the training data for our proposed Artificial Sentience system called ISAIAH. -->

<!-- The separation of memory from remembering is useful in:
- Bio Superphysics for memory problems, dementia, and
- Material Superphysics for the creation of artificial sentience. -->

<!-- For example, the interplay of desire, mind-memory, and consciousness explains why  -->
