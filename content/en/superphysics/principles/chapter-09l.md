Material Superphysics explains that the physical phenomena on Earth such as storms and rain are caused by our sun and by gravitational effects from other massive bodies within our solar system.

Bio Superphysics explains that the social phenomena on Earth such as animal migration, economic crises, war, etc. are caused by starlight.

This is easily proven by starlight from the sun which we call sunlight.
- It makes human society wake up in the morning and sleep at night.

The effects of of the sunâ€™s starlight is so obvious that we:
- take it for granted
- see it different from the starlight of distant stars
