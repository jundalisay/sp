Chapter 1 explained that waves become nodes when they are concentrated together.  We then call these nodes as ideas. 

Since these nodes are really waves, they easily show wave-properties. One of these properties is the connection of ideas, as Property 1 explained in Chapter 1d. 


## Compound Ideas are Made up of Simple Ideas

Since ideas are static, it is the mind, powered by desire, that connects them together, in a chain. This leads to the creation of compound ideas from many simple ones.

{{< q a="David Hume" c="Enquiry on Human Understanding, Section 5" >}}
These principles of connection or association are resemblance, contiguity and causation. These are the
only bonds that unite our thoughts together, and beget that regular train of reflection or discourse.”
{{< /q >}}

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="Heavens, Book 1, Part 5" >}}
Every body is either simple or composite. The infinite body, therefore, will be either simple or composite.
{{< /q >}}


Spinoza earlier had a similar idea, though linking the connection of ideas to God. 

{{< q a="Spinoza" c="The Ethics Simplified, Part 2, Proposition 7" >}}
The order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things.
{{< /q >}}



While the 5 Elements show the vertical hierarchy of reality, the connection of ideas, and integration of simple into complex, show its lateral organization, creating a pyramid of ideas.

When applied to living minds, this leads to the oversoul with many individual souls, each with many selves. 

- Each soul has many selves in each alternate reality which is created from spacetime slices. This is essential in Bio-Superphysics.
- Individual souls taken together make up the soul of society, which we call the metaphysical society-organism. This is essential in Social Superphysics

<!-- The concept of the dharma of ideas, combined with their inherent ability to be connected to, and fused with, each other (as to create ideas within ideas), is the foundation of our concept of the oversoul wherein:
- a soul, as an idea of the Supreme, has many selves as its sub-ideas.  -->


{{< i s="/graphics/meta/ideas.jpg" a="Main Ideas" c="Ideas can be thought of as clouds that connect to each other, split up, or combine, just as selves are connected to souls which are connected to oversouls or grouped together as society-organisms" >}}


{{< q a="David Hume" c="A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 4, Section 6" >}}
The soul is like a republic with members united by the reciprocal ties of government and subordination. This gives rise to other persons who propagate the same republic through constant change. The same republic may change its members, laws, and constitutions. Similarly, a person may vary his character, disposition, impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his parts are still connected by causation.
{{< /q >}}


To save itself energy, the mind usually connects those ideas that are resembling, contiguous, or those that are easily linked by cause and effect. This leads to shallow analysis and conclusions.

For example, a wife might notice that her husband comes home late from work often. Her mind connects facts and, without effort, jumps to the conclusion that he is cheating on her. 

{{< i s="/photos/psych/wife.jpg" alt="Wife" >}}

This can be avoided by critical thinking and critical feeling which “catches” the thoughts and feelings, to be explained in Chapter 8.


## Belief, Opinion, Concept, Gnómé, Indoctrination, Dogma

Compound ideas can be connected to other compound ones that impart a similar vibration or feeling in order to reinforce each other. This is caled a concept or conception. 

A concept turns to a belief when the ego attaches itself to it.

A belief and concept can be:
- positive, such as the belief in a Savior, in better days ahead, etc. or
- negative, such as the belief that Friday the 13 th is bad luck, that an Apocalypse will happen, etc

Many beliefs are imposed on us by our parents and by society during our childhood. These can be religious, cultural, scientific, philopsophical, etc. 

{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia, Part 1, Article 71" >}}
The chief cause of our errors is in the prejudices of our childhood.
{{< /q >}}


A belief is a network of related ideas that the ego attaches itself to. This emphasizes the attachment of the ego which can be:
- natural, as self-adoption, or
- artificial, as imposition

Gnómé is a strong belief that is adopted by self-reasoning. This is from the Positive Force and is opposed to indoctrination

Indoctrination is the imposition of a belief through the Negative Force.

Dogma is a systemic indoctrination.

An opinion is an idea or smaller set of ideas that the ego attaches to.   

A belief that never had believers is just a concept. 

Since beliefs can be positive or negative then it follows that not all beliefs are good, just as not all opinions are correct. The most dangerous are dogmas that limit the capabilities of the mind.

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Discourse on Sin, Crime and Law" >}}
The human mind becomes inert and dormant in society due to old dogmas, weaknesses, and lack of proper education. Mental stagnancy is a kind of disease. It is motionlessness. People should not be allowed to rely on the dogmas of their ancestors as it obstructs their own mental pursuit.
{{< /q >}}


A survey of the prevailing beliefs therefore exposes the wave-forms, mentalities, positivity and negativity active in a society or planet. 

The plotting of the changes of beliefs and their intensity through space and time can expose the evolution of the oversoul of a species or the spirit of a planet. 


Even science has dogmas which Superphysics corrects:

Field of Study | Dogma | Problems Caused | Superphysics Solution
--- | --- | --- | ---
Science | Evidence must be from 5 Senses | Ignores metaphysical perception as intuitional feeling, limiting the sciences | 2 Domains and Intuition
Economics | Money and Profit Maximization | Economic crises, Poverty, Inequality | Moneyless system
Physics | Gravity comes from Matter | No anti gravity, teleportation, free energy | Gravity comes from the Aether 
Western Medicine | Treating Symptom or Effect instead of Cause | Diseases recur and side effects created | 5 Element Medical Paradigm
Sociology | Differences in Culture, Language | War, Nationalism, Terrorism, Disputes | Society Organism
Evolution Theory | Survival of the Fittest | Nazism, Racism, Exploitation of the Weak | Evolution by Will 
Psychology | Consciousness Comes From Brain | Ineffective Treatments that cause side effects | Consciousness Comes From Soul


## Belief Systems and Religions

Beliefs can be organized into a belief system, as a logical collection of related ideas that the ego can adopt and attach itself to.

This belief system is an expression of culture, as an expression of a society, just as personality is the expression of a person.
- A society is a metaphysical organism made up of individual souls connected and united together

Most belief system are unorganized. 

An organized belief system has the following components:

1. A founder
2. Scripture or text from the founder
3. An organization with rules

A religion has all these components, with the difference that religions deal with metaphysics. 

This is why we call Modern Physics as a religion whenever it deals with the cause of Existence. 

Belief System | Founder | Text | Organization
--- | --- | --- | --- | 
Catholicism | Jesus | Bible | Catholic Church
Islam | Mohammad | Quran | Local Mosque Organization 
Buddhism | Buddha | Tipataka | Local Sangha
Communism | Marx | Communist Manifesto | Communist Party
Nazism | Hitler | Mein Kampf | Nazi Party
Modern Capitalism | Samuelson | Economics | Liberal Party
Classical Physics | Newton | Principia Mathematica | Royal Society
Modern Physics | Einstein | Annus mirabilis papers | CERN

From this table, we can see that belief systems contain the vibration of the founder and the culture of the society that established them.
