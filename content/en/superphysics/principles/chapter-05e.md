Each Idea is Unique | Movement Comes from the Objects Preserving their Uniqueness

Chapter 1 explained the Existence began when the Absolute Entity destabilized Itself to create waves of ideas which transformed It into the Supreme Entity. 

This Existence Itself is an idea of the Consciousness of the Absolute, leading to Existence-Consciousness or the Supreme Entity.

This Existence-Idea has subideas within It as universes, dimensions, densities, etc. according to the pyramid or tetrahedral structure of the compound ideas and simple ideas. 



## Unity Leading to Conservation Leading to Constants

Since there is no Void within the idea of Existence, one change in a part of Existence will necessarily affect the other parts. 

This is similar to Brownian motion where a change in one particle affects all others next to it, and then those particles affect those next to them.

This one particle affecting others is now known as the Law of Conservation of Momentum which is a conservation law.

Rene Descartes first proposed conservation as preservation by Nature, leading to the Laws of Nature:


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="The World, Chapter 7" >}}
"Nature" here means the aether itself, assuming that God continues to preserve it in the same way that He created it. There are many changes in the aethereal particles that are not caused by the action of God. This means that those changes are from nature as the aether itself. 
- It follows that God continues to preserve the aether. 
- The rules on how the changes in the aether take place I call the "Laws of Nature"

Likewise, all of Superphysics is dominated by what we call **The Law of Conservation of Idea**. This states that all ideas:
- already pre-exist
- cannot be created nor destroyed, and
- are unique.

This uniqueness means that **each idea has its own properties** as imbued by its Creator.
- These inherent properties are called its *dharma* or true nature. <!-- Unlike nature which si -->
- The inherent property of a unique idea or object is called **svadharma**

This law explains the principles in various sciences, such as:
- The mind having only one thought at a time in Psychology 
- The Pauli Exclusion Principle in Physics
- A territory having only one state in Politics

### Why Must Identities Be Unique?

Chapter 3 explained that Existence-Consciousness is really 1 unit entity called the Supreme Entity. As a single unit, it means that all its parts affect all its other parts. 

Having a duplicate part will create an imperfection or excess in the unit, just as 1.0000001 is an imperfection of 1. 

Therefore, everything is unique so that 1 stays as 1.

## Uniqueness Leads to All Movement in Existence

This property of uniqueness creates all of the dynamism in both physical and metaphysical domains. This dynamism is what we call change, movement, and evolution.

For example, suppose you have a tray that can only hold 10 apples. 

{{< img src="/photos/objects/apples.jpg" alt="Apples" >}}


Adding more apples will either:
- make those additional apples fall off if the tray is strong, or
- make the apples in the tray burst out if the tray is weak. 

Either way, the mere addition of apples causes movement, as a reaction to those new additions.

The tray represents the mind of the universe which holds its ideas. The addition of new ideas creates reactions from the already-existing ideas. 

This leads to movement for those new and old ideas inside the universe-container. This movement affects all ideas just as the addition of the apple affects all apples already in the tray -- the more ideas, the more the dynamism and energy.

 <!-- dynamism that is far more energetic than the original addition-action.   -->

From here it follows that:
- the universe is inherently dynamic
- there is an inherent potential dynamism in each object 
- an object's dynamism can be tapped by letting it interact with the proper objects other than itself
- the dynamism of objects depend on their relations with each other

This is the foundation of our **Theory of Dynamism**. 

This theory aims to know the causes and effects of all movements, whether physical or metaphysical. This is to harness such movement and dynamism in order to reach our goals, such as to solve problems that are unsolved by Physics and Science.  

In the metaphysical domain, these movements take the form of reflection (as the 'bouncing back' mentioned in Chapter 1),  deflection, dissipation, merging, etc. **These are the dynamics of waves.** Thus, we say that **the metaphysical domain has a wave-like nature**.
