The previous chapter explained the 3 parts of a perpetual wave-interaction from the 2 Forces. 

1. Positive Dominant
2. Neutral or Balanced
3. Negative Dominant

When applied to the active circular part of reality, this leads to 3 movements which we call influences or subforces, called the gunas in Vedic philospophy 


<!-- {{< i s="/graphics/super/wave.jpg" alt="Wave" cap="A wave has crests and troughs" >}} -->

<!-- 2 Forces interact with each other creating waves with 3 parts:

1. Crest
2. Origin, Rest, or Pause
3. Trough

<!-- When applied on the circular journey from pre-existence to existence and back to pre-existence, the 3 parts created by the 2 Forces manifest as 3 Influences: -->


3. Crudifying

This part crudifies the Supreme's metaphysical ideas in order to have physical existence.

2. Convertible 

This part part churns the created building blocks in order to create a diverse existence.

1. Subtlifying

This part makes the transformed substances more subtle in order to leave physical reality and enter metaphysicality as ideas.  

{{< q a="Ramakrishna" c="The Gospel of Ramakrishna" >}}
Under the spell of God's maya, man forgets his true nature. He forgets that he is heir to the infinite glories of his Father. This divine maya is made up of 3 gunas: 
1. Sattva
2. Rajas
3. Tamas
{{< /q >}}


{{< img src="/graphics/meta/gunas.png" alt="Gunas" cap="The 2 Forces create 3 influences based on their mutual interaction: Crudifying, Transforming, and Subtlifying." >}}

<!-- These are also the parts of a wave as the crest, middle part, and trough. These are known as the 3 gunas as Tamasic, Rajasic, and Sattvic. Each layer has these influences, creating 3 sublayers within a layer. -->


## The 3 Influences Lead to the 3 Subelements

These 3 influences affect the Elements and create 3 subelements in each:

3. Lower

Here, the Crudifying Influence is stronger

2. Middle

Here, the Transforming Influence is stronger

1. Higher

Here, the Subtlifying Influence is stronger


{{< img src="/graphics/physics/msq.svg" alt="The 3 Gunas create the 3 sublayers per Layer" cap="The 3 Gunas create the 3 sublayers per Layer, as well as the internal layer boundary" >}}

These manifest most obviously in the Earth Element or Strong Force as the 3 'colors' of quarks.
