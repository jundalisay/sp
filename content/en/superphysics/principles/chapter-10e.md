Chapter 9f explained the concept of group feeling which:
- facilitates mutual communication
- allows symbiosis or mutually-beneficial exchanges


This leads to an unwritten energy economy within an ecosystem. 

In the current human society, the energy economy is based on goods and services that are exhchanged for mutual benefit. 

This leads to the 4 Laws of Value

1. Everyone has value

2. Value is created to remove lack

3. There must be balance in the creation and spread of value 

4. Value spreads through fair exchange


Economic problems happen when these laws are violated. 

Law | Violations lead to Problems
--- | ---
1 | Poverty Cycle, Unemployment
2 | Bubbles, Excess Capacity
3 | Moral Hazard, Low Tax Revenue
4 | Inflation, Trade Deficit


## Solution: Demand, Supply, Industry, Trade

To make the implementation of th 4 laws easier, we create a Demand, Supply, Industry, Trade (DSIT) Model with 4 components.

1. Demand

This is based on population size in a group or society. Its main goal is to ensure that the population has their basic needs met through the minimum requirements doctrine.

2. Supply

This is based on productivity of the population. This is done by:
- finding the economic gravitational signature of each person, as the primary arbitrage
- maximizing the relationality between people, as the secondary arbitrage

3. Industry 

This is the structure of the production and distribution to make the economy sustainable, including government regulations and taxation. 


4. Trade

This is the mechanism for exchange and distribution of goods and services. This includes logistics and finance.


<!-- We use the Demand, Supply, Industry, Trade model to correct the violations of the 4 laws. -->

<!-- Unlike the Capitalist system which emphasizes money and territory, the natural system focuses on location and personality.
- Location is the physical domain
- Personality is the metaphysical domain -->

<!-- ## Example -->


## First Law

Minimum Needs


## Second law 

The Invisble Hand of Human Dharma
