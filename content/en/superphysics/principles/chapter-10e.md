Chapter 9f explained the concept of group feeling which:
- facilitates mutual communication
- allows symbiosis or mutually-beneficial exchanges


This leads to an unwritten energy economy within an ecosystem. 

In the current human society, the energy economy is based on goods and services that are exhchanged for mutual benefit. 

This leads to the 4 Laws of Value

1. Everyone has value

2. Value is created to remove lack

3. There must be balance in the creation and spread of value 

4. Value spreads through fair exchange


Economic problems happen when these laws are violated. 

Law | Problem Caused
--- | ---
1 | Poverty Cycle, Unemployment
2 | Bubbles, Excess Capacity
3 | Moral Hazard, Low Tax Revenue
4 | Inflation, Trade Deficit


## Solution: Demand, Supply, Industry, Trade

We use the Demand, Supply, Industry, Trade model to correct the violations of the 4 laws.
