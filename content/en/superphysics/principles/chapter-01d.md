The first section explained how the 2 domains are static divisions of Existence, based on immediate perception as physical or metaphysical.

<!-- Section 1b explained that Existence is made up of waves that are never static. -->

Section 1c explained that reality is the part of Existence which is made up of waves that are never static.

So how come our reality has static non-moving forms as rocks and metals? 


## Causal, Subtle, Crude within Physical and Metaphysical

<!-- To have a basis for the actual phenomena that is sequential or made up of successive perceptions, -->

To explain static objects in a dynamic Existence, we create the 3 operational divisions of reality as:

1. Causal
2. Subtle
3. Crude

{{< q a="Ibn Khaldun" c="Muqaddimah" >}}
The ability to think has several degrees.
1. The first degree.. mostly consists of perceptions. 
2. The experimental intellect
3. The speculative intellect 
{{< /q >}}


This is similar to the Freudian divisions of the mind as:

- Unconscious
- Subconscious
- Conscious

However, our difference is that the basis for the divisions are not awareness, but the properties of the 2 Forces of Positive and Negative. 
- This is the same basis of the 2 domains. 

The interaction of different phenomena take place in 3 divisions based on their affinity with either the Positive or Negative Forces.

A static non-moving solid object get its staticity from the dominance of the Negative Force.
- This principle is the basis for freezing photons to be used for light-based computing to bypass Moore's law in transistors


### Basis for the Groupings of Phenomena

These divisions are the basis for different groups of phenomena:

Division | Phenomena 
--- | --- 
Causal | Abstract
Subtle | Living
Crude | Non-Living 

Each of these divisions have its own subdivisions made up of 5 parts.

Division | Subdivision 
--- | --- 
Causal | 5 Strata
Subtle | 5 Elements
Crude | 5 Layers 

- The 5 parts of the causal subdivision is called the 5 Strata
- The 5 parts of the subtle subdivision is called the 5 Elements, with reference to the Asian 5 Elements
- The 5 parts of the crude subdivision is called the 5 Layers

These phenomena and subdivisions will be studied by the different branches of Superphysics.


Subdivision |  Phenomena | Superphysics Branch 
--- | --- | ---
5 Strata | Abstract | Social and Spiritual 
5 Elements | Living | Bio
5 Layers | Non-Living | Material
