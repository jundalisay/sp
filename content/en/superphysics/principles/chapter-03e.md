The previous posts explained:
- the great loop from Desire to Experience
- the Positive and Negative Directions

This great loop manifests to us as the cycle of creation which starts in a Negative Direction from the Negative Force.

1. The ideas of the Supreme starts as vibrating waves in the Aethereal layer 
2. These are crudified by the Negative Force into galaxies in the Spatial layer
3. These then lead to stars and electromagnetism in the Radiant layer
4. From stellar systems, planets and matter are formed.

This creates physical reality. It then switches into the Positive Direction thanks to the Positive Force.

5. Life originates in matter through the Positive Force
6. The Positive Force makes life evolve into multicelluar organisms, plants, animals
7. Finally, life evolves into the human structure (or aliens with highly developed brains)
8. Such developed beings then gain the ability to detect the aether and so can evolve into non-physical spirits, back into the original aether substance


Material Superphysics deals with the Negative Direction as the creation from the aether into materiality. 

Bio Superphysics and Spiritual Superphysics deals with the Positive Direction from materiality into the aether or spirituality



## Mentality Creates Reality

The 5 Elements show the journey of an idea of the Supreme from metaphysical into physical reality. 

1. The Supreme Entity has an idea in the Aethereal Element.
2. It is then deployed through a galaxy in a universe in the Air Element (space).
3. It then spreads as particles through the Fire and Earth Element (electromagnetism and Strong Force) made varied by the Water Element (Weak Force).

This is also true for any phenomena:

1. You have an aethereal idea to bake a cake.
2. You walk to the space (Air Element) in the kitchen where the ingredients are.
3. You put the material ingredients (Earth Element), such as flour, together through intermolecular forces (Water Element)
4. You put bake them using heat (Fire Element)

{{< i s="/photos/objects/cake.jpg" a="Cake" >}}

The whole process of making the cake begins with the idea and feeling to bake cake. The whole process stops it the desire to finish the process also stops. 

This is why “mentality creates reality”. 

This truth is perpetually challenged by materialists who believe that the matter (Earth Element) is superior to idea and feeling (Aether).

And so they put forth the opposite maxim “seeing is believing” or “matter creates mind”. 

{{< q a="Karl Marx" c="The German Ideology, Part 1" >}}
The production of ideas, consciousness, is at first directly interwoven with the material activity of men, the language 
of real life. Conceiving, thinking appear at this stage as the direct efflux of their material behaviour.

This materialist doctrine goes against the order of Nature by making matter superior to the aether. 

It is no wonder that Communist and Capitalist systems* collapse by themselves from the inside instead of from any external force:
- The fall of the Soviet Union was begun by Gorbachev
- The 2008 Financial Crisis was begun by Wall Street banks 

{{< n n="*Communism is based on dialetical materialism, specifically the dominance of matter. Capitalism is based on economic materialism, specifically the love for money" >}}


<!-- Chapter 2 explained how this cycle means that mentality creates reality. 

It follows that instead of praying to an external God, we can improve our reality (existence) by knowing our own mentality (consciousness) better.

This is because desire creates existence through the medium of consciousness which is inside the mind.

Since desire is a feeling and a feeling is a wave, then the many desires that we have form a of multitude of waves that collectively make up our mentality.
- The mentality of a Christian is formed by Christian desires
- The mentality of a Muslim is formed by Islamic desires
- The mentality of a scientist is formed by the desires for science
- The mentality of a K-pop fan is formed by the desires for K-pop

A person’s mentality then leads to his actions in physical reality. -->


The superiority of the aether over matter is proven by mind over matter and by grit creating success despite material adversity. 

{{< q a="David Hume" c="A Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 2, Section 2" >}}
It is an established maxim in metaphysics, that whatever the mind clearly conceives, includes the idea of possible existence, or in other words, nothing we imagine is absolutely impossible.
{{< /q >}}

A variation of this is ‘If you want to experience a certain reality, then you first have to want it’:
- some people go through life without knowing what they want
- other people claim that they know exactly what they want

Both of these are extremes which will reduce the probability of them experiencing their desired reality.
- the people who don’t know what they want will have too little desire-power (too little Negative Force) to materialize their ideas. An analogy is the undercooking of a dish.
- the people who specify exactly what they want will have too much desire (too much Negative Force) leading to a premature and rigid materialization. This explains why sheer grit and determination do not always lead to success. An analogy is the
overcooking of a dish.


### How To Get The Right Desires

Since a balance of the Positive and Negative is essential in sustaining Existence, then we will have a better chance to materialize ideas if they originate from the highest Layer (i.e. the Supreme Entity or higher mind) while having the most desire (i.e. passion or grit) to make them real. 

These have the highest quality of Positive and Negative Forces.

Various schools of thought already encourage hardwork, passion, and perseverance. The most popular movement in recent years is the Law of Attraction which promotes positive thinking in order to manifest one’s desires and passions. 

**But very few are able to instruct us on what should we be passionate about.**  This is why both traditional and modern ways to get success are not always effective.

This will be explained in the chapter on gravitational signatures.
