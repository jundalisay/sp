<!-- gives the properties of time and space to ideas and feelings. This is represented by the Heart Chakra. -->

The Air Element facilitates the functioning of space and time in reality. Its job is to separate perceptions, identities, objects, ideas, and feelings from each other. 

This is why it is the Element for the Forces such as gravity, magnetism, and material cohesion. 

This is why, in love relationships, space as proximity is very important and why long distance relationships are not usually strong, just as magnetism is strong but has a short range, and gravity is weak but has a longer range.  

Without space and time, all perceptions would be in one experience and be very messy. 

Spacetime is also the key to understanding the aether which is above it.

This is why only long-running civilizations, such as the ancient Egyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, have a chance at unlocking the aether.

A small part of the Air Element is metaphysical. This is why Modern Physics is unable to discover the cause of gravity and is why there is currently still no true anti-gravity technologies. 


Subscience | Name | Use of the Spatial Layer
--- | --- | ---
Material Superhysics | Spatial Layer | The start of physicality by providing the physical arena for the ideas as light, matter, objects, etc.  
Bio Superphysics | Air Element | This facilitates the chi or animal spirits and chakras (as organic spatial vortices) that lead to different emotions
Spiritual Superphysics | Spatial Stratum | This facilitates spiritual feelings
 <!-- dynamics of the Heart Chakra -->


{{< q a="Rene Descartes" c="Principia Philosophia Part 4, Article 202" >}}
I deny the existence of gravity inside any body. Gravity is a quality that depends on the relations of situation and motion of several bodies on each other.

{{< q a="Leucipus">}}
The elements, and the worlds which are derived from them, are infinite, and are dissolved again into them.

The worlds are produced in this way: many bodies, of various kinds and shapes, are separated from the infinite, into a vast vacuum.

They are then collected together, produce one vortex.

This makes them dash against one another, and whirling around in every direction.

This separates them so that like attaches to like.

The soon stop spinning because:
- they are all of equal weight
- they are so plentiful

The thin ones depart into the outer vacuum, as if they bounded through.

The others remain behind, becoming entangled with one another. 

They run together and produce a spherical shape.

This subsists as a kind of membrane, containing within itself bodies of every kind.

These whirl around, revolving according to the resistance of the centre.

The circumambient membrane becomes thin, since bodies are without ceasing, uniting according to the impulse given by the vortex.

In this way, the earth is produced, since these bodies which have once been brought to the centre remain there.

On the other side, there is produced another enveloping membrane which increases incessantly by the accretion of exterior bodies.

As it is itself animated by a circular movement, drags with it, and adds to itself, everything it meets with.

Some of these bodies thus enveloped re-unite again and form compounds, which are at first moist and clayey, but soon becoming dry, and being drawn on in the universal movement of the circular vortex, they catch fire, and constitute the substance of the stars.
