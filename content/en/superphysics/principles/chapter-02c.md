The Wave-Nature of Reality means that one timespan or moment is connected to another timespan. 

The connection of these lead to the concept of time. 

But each of these timespans is really caused by 2 perceptions. The gap between these 2 perceptions is what we call timespan.

This means that timespan and time are effects of perception. 

But perception is merely a disturbance in the pure aether substance which is totally independent of other disturbances. 

This means that each perception is independent. 

Therefore time and timespan are dependent on the current perception. 

The error is that people think that the current perception is dependent on the past, just as the future is dependent on the present. 


## Monty Hall Fallacy

The same fallacy of treating events as not independent (as if there were a true starting point) afflicts the Monty Hall Problem.


<!-- is a fallacy of false motion or locality.  -->

The Monty Hall problem says that there are 3 doors. 
- One door has a prize.
- Two doors have nothing. 
- You choose door 1.
- The host removes Door 2 which has nothing.

'Smart' people say to choose the other door because the odds have risen from 1/3 to 2/3.

They then defend their logic by expanding the scenario to 300 doors. After choosing a door, the host opens the 298 other doors to leave only 2 doors unopened: your current choice and another door. And so you must choose that other door.

In reality, the odds in the 3 door scenario ended up as 50-50. 

To extend this to 300 doors, the proper way is for the host to open 100 contiguous doors. This leaves 2 groups of doors of 100 each. The host would then ask whether you want to choose the other 100 doors over your current group. So the probability is still 50-50 and not 2/3.
