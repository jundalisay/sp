The Law of Conservation of Idea in Chapter 5 explained how Existence is a single entity. This leads to:
- uniqeness
- the other conservation laws
- dynamic movement
- constants
- relationality

This dynamic movement is an effect of the attraction and repulsion of gravitational signatures:
- perserving their uniqueness
- keeping constant expression

This is most easily seen in:
- physical gravitation and magnetism
- the love and hate between people and groups

<!-- like attracts like and contradictory qualities repel. Yet we see in magnetism that oppsites attract and like charges repel.

frequency like 

1 commonality like attracts like 
2 spin opposites attract

{{< q a="PR Sarkar" c="Human Society Is One and Indivisible" >}}
From atoms and molecules to human beings with developed consciousness, all entities feel attraction for one another.. This is why attraction is the law of nature. Repulsion is negative attraction. The so-called differences that between human beings in the external world are merely expressions of negative attraction. For differences to occur, people must enter into some sort of relationship with each other. Without close proximity, there cannot be any friction. A serious difference of opinion today may be changed into friendship tomorrow. Thus, instead of reacting to apparent differences, one should seek internal unity. The points of affinity have got to be encouraged, the differences must be discouraged. No difference lasts long.

This concept of Attraction beyond physical magnetism and gravity became popular through the 2006 movie [The Secret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_(2006_film)) by Australian Rhonda Byrne. It was driven globally by Youtube which was a relatively new platform in 2006.


## Positive Thinking

The Law of Attraction is based on the principle of positive thinking which is then based on like attracting like. 

It's the same principle behind Christianity where people think of a Savior in order for their minds to become positive.
- This positivity will then help them deal with whatever problem or desire. 

That's why it takes root easily in the West where selfish-interest is common. 

The problem is positive thinking is just a qualitative change in frequency like 110 volts changing into 220.

It still needs a quantitative increase in amps. It means you do the visualization **ON TOP** of your old effort to reach your goals. 

The big problem is that usually, its practictioners **REDUCE** their effort after changing their polarity or quality. 

This causes their positivity to lack power.

This lack of power then results in more failure than if they had not adopted positivity.

It would be like switching from a 2 year old iPhone to a 10 year old Android (or switching from a 2 year old Android to a 10 year old iPhone), then complaining why it is worse. 

The proper solution is to add effort both in quality and quantity. This would be like:
- swithing from a 2 year old Android to the latest iPhone, or
- swithing from a 2 year old iPhone to the latest Android

Thats why action is very important in either the Law of Attractiion, Christianity, or any belief system. 

The enemy is all cases is the staticity of mind which is from the Negative Force, the same force that caused the problem
