Chapter 7 explained that the range of expression makes the difference between living and non-living things.
- living things are more expressive
- non-living things are less expressive

Their ability for perception and expression are determined by the quality and quantity of subtle waves that make up their nodes or minds.

- Simple bacteria express motion through adhesion
- Plants express independent motion through growth
