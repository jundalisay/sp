The previous section explained the 3 Actions of the Mind from the 3 Influences or Gunas as:

1. Flow
2. Force
3. Memory

The thinking process combines the actions of flow and force, with emphasis on force. Its opposite is inuition which uses Flow from the Higher Mind. 
- With thinking, you have to exert mental force
- Intution comes easily even without you thinking about it. An example is an idea that suddenly enters your mind out of the blue
- Thinking uses force to arrive at cognition, intuition, or realization

Thinking is done by the Lower Mind by processing idea-objects that come either from:
- the external senses, or
- the memory

The mind's tendency is to connect ideas that are similar to each other. This is because both the mind and its ideas are made of waves that naturally flow with or into each other. 


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 1, Section 4" >}}
All simple ideas may be separated and united by the imagination as it pleases. This separation and unity is guided by universal principles which make it always uniform. Nature points out to everyone those simple ideas which are most proper to be united into a complex one.
{{< /q >}}


We thus establish the flowing nature of the thinking process. But what directions does it take?

Since the actions of the mind are from the 3 Gunas or Influences, and since thinking is a flow, then it follows that thinking has 4 Properties which we can most easily see in arithmetical operations.


## The Four Operations of Arithmetic on Instances

Arithmetic is the basic core of mathematics that uses 4 operations from the flow which matches the 4 properties of waves:

1. Addition as 1st Property of Waves

The 1st Property of Waves is "no void". This is fulfilled by addition which adds onto the instances. This is like making a line move forward.

2. Division is the 2nd Property of Waves

The 2nd Property of Waves is frequency. A sound can be divided into smaller parts.  

3. Subtraction as the 3rd Property of Waves 

The 3rd Property of Waves is amplitude. A wave can have positive and negative values as it goes up and down.

4. Multiplication as the 4th Property of Waves 

The 4th Property of Waves is forward movement. Multiplication expands just as division contracts. 

Addition and Subtraction can start from zero just as a wave can shave an origin or middle point.

Division and Multiplication need a pre-existing instance, just as a frequency needs an existing wave, and expansion needs something to expand.  


## David Hume's Relations 

We then match these with Hume's 7 Relations to distill them into 4.

<!-- 1. Resemblance 2
2. Identity 1
3. Space and Time 4
4. Quantity and number 5. Quality 3 -->


1. Identity 

This is Property 1 of waves as commonality. This is the mechanism that quantizes or packages ideas into thoughts. 

<!-- Adding or Combinative -->


2. Resemblance

 <!-- Subtracting or Separative -->

This is Property 2 of waves as frequency or vibration. This is the affinity or discord between ideas to those in the personality.

This decides whether the idea will be detected in the first place. This is why some people get good ideas but others do not.  


3. Quantity and Quality

This is Property 3 as strength. This manifests as the ego which has a configuration called a personality. This actually processes the thought. 


4. Space and Time

This is Property 4 as spread. This makes the mind connect to other ideas automatically.

<!-- Note that memory is a quality of the mind, and not an operation. Remembering is part of the operations of consciousness, just as perception is.  -->

<!-- "Adding" or "combination" is the integration of one identity to another to create a new third identity. This is an effect of the Positive Force (Yang or Shiva)

For example, we:
- add `1 + 1` to make `2` 
- put more rice grains in a bag to make it reach 1 kilogram for purchase
- step in an empty bus so it can get passengers and start its journey

"Subtracting" or "separation" is the removal of one part of an identity in order to create a new identity. This is an effect of the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti or Prakrti)

For example, we:
- subtract `3 - 1` to make `2`
- remove things from our luggage so that it will meet the limit of 15 kilograms 
- step out of an overloaded bus so that it can run safely

Related operations of thinking spring from these 2 broad operations:

Combination Category:
- Multiplication
- Exponents
- Memory or Remembering
- etc

Separation Category:
- Division and Fractions
- Square roots
- Ignorance or Forgetting
- etc -->
<!-- - Factorials and Multiples -->
