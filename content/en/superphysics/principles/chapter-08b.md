The previous section explained the 3 Actions of the Mind. 

The thinking process combines the actions of flow and force.

It is done by the Lower Mind by processing idea-objects that come either from:
- the external senses, or
- the memory

The mind's tendency is to connect ideas that are similar to each other. This is because both the mind and its ideas are made of waves that naturally flow with or into each other. 


{{< q a="David Hume" c="Treatise of Human Nature, Book 1, Part 1, Section 4" >}}
All simple ideas may be separated and united by the imagination as it pleases. This separation and unity is guided by universal principles which make it always uniform. Nature points out to everyone those simple ideas which are most proper to be united into a complex one.

We thus establish the flowing nature of the thinking process. But what directions does it take?

We then group this thinking operation into 2 categories:

<!-- From here, we can say that all of the activities or operations of the mind's intellect can be broadly categorized into two: -->

1. Adding or Combinative
2. Subtracting or Separative

We also group this feeling operation into 2 categories:
<!-- The activities or operations mind's heart can also be broadly categorized into two: -->

1. Attraction
2. Repulsion

Attraction has a combinative net effect just as repulsion has a separative one. 

Therefore the active mind, which thinks and feels, has 2 kinds of operations:
- Combination
  - This comes from the Positive Force
- Separation
  - This comes from the Negative Force

<!-- Note that memory is a quality of the mind, and not an operation. Remembering is part of the operations of consciousness, just as perception is.  -->

<!-- ## The Operations of Thinking  -->
<!-- the Intellect -->

<!-- "Adding" or "combination" is the integration of one identity to another to create a new third identity. This is an effect of the Positive Force (Yang or Shiva)

For example, we:
- add `1 + 1` to make `2` 
- put more rice grains in a bag to make it reach 1 kilogram for purchase
- step in an empty bus so it can get passengers and start its journey


"Subtracting" or "separation" is the removal of one part of an identity in order to create a new identity. This is an effect of the Negative Force (Yin or Shakti or Prakrti)

For example, we:
- subtract `3 - 1` to make `2`
- remove things from our luggage so that it will meet the limit of 15 kilograms 
- step out of an overloaded bus so that it can run safely


Related operations of thinking spring from these 2 broad operations:

Combination Category:
- Multiplication
- Exponents
- Memory or Remembering
- etc

Separation Category:
- Division and Fractions
- Square roots
- Ignorance or Forgetting
- etc -->
<!-- - Factorials and Multiples -->
