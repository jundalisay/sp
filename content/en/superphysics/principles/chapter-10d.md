## The Problem with Human Rights

The Europeans instituted universal human rights through the ideas of John Locke, Immanuel Kant. These were established after the horrors of World War 2.  

However, they also created ideological conflict. 

1. Conflict against Conservative Culture

Human rights enshrined liberalism which is against the conservative values of most of the world by promoting ideas such as:
- individualism
- freedom of speech
- gender equality

This goes against cultures that emphasize collectivism and social order over expression. 


2. Conflict between Religion and Spirituality

Human rights are said to be natural yet there is no clear explanation or mechanism what causes them.  This is because the Europeans focused on thinking instead of feeling. 

For example, Asians have spiritual techniques to detect metaphysical phenomena like reincarnation and samskara. Asian philosophy would say that human rights is complicated since each soul varies in the level of development. 

Some souls might be crude and animalistic. Others might be advanced. 

- Crude souls are incapable of control and expression and so should not be given many rights
- Advanced souls are capable of more control and expression and so would want more rights. 

Moreover, human rights are casuistic just like Western morals which do not have deep metaphysics. 

For example, John Locke's basis for human rights is the will of God. 



## Entity Rights as a Solution

Instead of defining a rigid or casuistic system of human rights, we propose a flexible system called Entiy Rights.
