The previous section explained how the dimensions of space and time are caused by the mind perceiving and stitching together the slices of space and time differently.

Cruder minds have a limited range and so can only perceive the basic dimensions.

For example a dot that just can go forward and backward can only create a line. 

But a dot that can go forward and backward and sideways can form a plane. 

So the ability to detect more dimensions is sourced from the freedom and strength of the perceiving mind.
- Freedom is from the Positive Force
- Strength is from the Negative Force

We say that a mind that has a higher *density* if it has more of the Positive and Negative, with more importance on the Positive.

These then correlates to the range that it can detect of the domains and dimensions.   

Domain | Density | Name | Manifestation
--- | --- | --- | ---
Physical | 1 | Identity | Pure Staticity, perceives as objects
Physical | 2 | Self | Perceives from a single point
Physical | 3 | Collective | Perceives as a group
Quasi-Physical | 4 | Lower Mind | In between physical and metaphysical perceptions
Metaphysical | 5 | Higher Mind | Start of pure metaphysical domain
Metaphysical | 6 | Soul | Universes in the Multiverse
Metaphysical |  7 | Brahma or Oversoul  | Ultimate Cause
Void |  8 | Non-Existential | Void

Currently, humans are on the early stages of the 4th density. 
- We have long had the concept of the malleability or subjectivity of time since the time of the Vedas, Gita, Parmenides and the Stoics.
- We have knowledge of abstract philosophy which proves a belief in the metaphysical domain. 
- Yet there is no consensus of what the “physics” of the metaphysical domain is. 

This is what Superphysics aims to provide in order to help advance the human species to the upper densities and dimensions.


## Connects to the Chakras

Of these 8 densities, 7 matches the 7 chakras in yoga since the 8th density is only theoretical. 

Physically, the dimensions will be useful in Material Superphysics.

Metaphysically, the densities will be useful in Bio-Superphysics which deals with life and the chakras.

For example, after death a person’s soul might be subtle enough to move on to the metaphysical domain into the 5th and 6th densities as a spiritual or luminous entity. 

Usually, a soul’s advancement is not so rapid and so it might go back into the physical domain as 4 th
density.

More importantly, these dimensions and densities give the soul a direction in life – to aim for the subtler and higher realms instead of wasting time trapped in the lower densities. This goal is called the state of samadhi:

{{< q a="Buddha" c="Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sutta" >}}
’Where does this Buddha come from and where am I going? As I think of this Buddha, He comes from nowhere and I am going nowhere. As I think of the desire realm, the form realm, and the formless realm*, these three realms are formed by my mind. I can see what I think of. The mind forms a Buddha for itself to see; the mind is the Buddha mind. As my mind forms a Buddha, my mind is the Buddha; my mind is the Tathāgata; my mind is my body.’ Although the mind sees a Buddha, the mind neither knows itself nor sees itself. The mind with perceptions is saṁsāra; the mind without perceptions is nirvāṇa. Dharmas as perceived are not something pleasurable. They are empty thoughts, nothing real. This is what Bodhisattvas see as they abide in this samādhi.

form realm is in the physical domain. Desire makes up the 2 Forces which
will be explained in Chapter 3. -->
