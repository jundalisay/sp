Ego is the feeling of the self. 

This is from the Law of Conservation of Idea which creates the uniqueness in everything in Existence by separating the Absolute Entity into parts to generate the Supreme Entity. 

This separation is done by the Negative Force. This is why ego in the operating universe is called the Negative Ego because its continued existence implies the constant dominance of the Negative. 

A self that that triumphs over the Negative will lose his ego and feel one with others.

The unification of selves happens in the upper limites of Existence, which is realized through samadhi.

A self that that absorbs or loses to the Negative will become egotistic.

<!-- This is why  -->

Men, who are great lovers of themselves, waste the public. They divide people with reason, between self-love and society.. The ego is a poor centre of a man's actions.

Group Feeling checks the personal ego, but it also creates a group ego that might clash with other group egos. 


## The Supreme Entity as a Check Against the Ego


We can say that personal and group egos are checked by the Supreme Ego.
