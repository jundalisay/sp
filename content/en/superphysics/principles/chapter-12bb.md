The cause of error in science is the imposition of universal objectivity. 

The problem is that:
- Objectivity is from the negative force
- Existence is mostly positive and therefore subjective

So science itself is negative or evil (if we associate the Negative Force with evil). 


The cause of error in Western philosophy is the lack of spiritual technique which leads to spiritual tradition that sustains itself. 

The lack of technique is from the lack of a teacher. 

Ths teacher in Western philosophy seemed to by Pythagoras. 

Jesus only taught for 3 short years, which is useless since metaphysical skills take years and even lifetimes to develop. 

In contrast, there are many gurus in Asia such as:
- Shiva
- Krishna
- Buddha
- Mahavira
- Patanjali
- Sikh gurus
- Taoist masters
- Yogananda
- Sai Baba
- Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
- PR Sarkar
- etc


This is why advanced souls might choose to incarnate in India which has a relative abundnace of gurus to help advanced souls pick up where they left off in the past life.
