The Positive Force is Superior to the Negative | Socratic Dialectics uses the Positive Force to sort through the belligerence of the Positive and Negative within the 5 Layers
{{< /dc >}}


The previous section explained dialectics to expose fallacies and conclude debates with a positive and united answer or position.

Dialectics is a method from the Positive Force of using philosophical dialogue in order to discover the truth, dharma, or to arrive at a solution.

This is because the Negative Force clouds all phenomena in varying extents. The bigger the problem, the stronger or more stubborn the Negative Force, as the Maya that hides the answer or solution to the problem. The solution is arrived at by finding the dharma or wave-signature in a mess of confusing waves which have come from external influences or from internal samskara that is arriving to cause negative karma or reaction.

An analogy is a messy room that is cleaned often by making a bigger mess as all the things are taken out for classification and sorting.   

{{< i s="/graphics/meta/messy.jpg" a="Before and After" c="The messy room is like a stressful situation with internal conflicts and disharmonies. The clean room is removes the stress by restoring harmony" >}}

Disagreements arise from minds taking different positions from the differences between their wave-patterns. These differences can be many and strong (wave-strength is a 3rd property of waves). 

Perpetual disagreements can arise from these waves being perpetually strong, allowing no compromise or absorption of the rival waves. This is seen in conflicts between:
- Jews and Muslims
- Liberals and Convervatives
- Science and Religion  
- Countries fighting for the same territory 

The solution by wise philosophers such as Socrates, Archytas, and Plato was to use the Positive Force to naturally peel away the Negative influence in order to find out the dharma or true wave nature of the minds that are having the problem.  

This is done by Positive-Minded questioning to reveal the Negative-minded response.

The negativity in the response is then exposed, cleaning up the Negativity from that wave. This then exposes other supporting Negative waves (as negative beliefs, ideas, or impositions) which are also questioned, repeating the process. 

{{< i s="/graphics/logic/solution.jpg" a="Solution from Dialectics" c="Dialectics uses opposing thinking forces, through question and answer, to probe for the dharma, tao, or solution which represents the signature of the situation or issue" >}}

In time, the negative waves are cleaned up to reveal the causal wave or mentality that is agreeable to all, since dharma is always Positive.  

For example, a couple might be arguing where to eat:

- the woman wants to eat at a Chinese restaurant
- the man wants to  eat at a French restaurant

If there were no Positive Force between them, then they would eat separately. This would fix the Negative Problem with a Negative Solution by destroying the loving relationship. 

But since the Socratic dialectician can sense the Positive Love between them, then he will unify their negativity, as their opposing desires, by splitting up that negativity into 2 times: the couple could eat at Chinese restaurant today, and eat at a French restaurant tomorrow. Note how this solution includes the cultural context of appeasing or satisfying the woman first. 

{{< i s="/graphics/logic/dialectic.jpg" a="Debate vs Dialectics" c="Diffcult disagreements (caused by conflicting aethereal ideas) can be easily resolved by tapping into the spacetime layer (giving it time)" >}}

More organized and formal processes that include dialectics are:

- Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) in psycho-therapy
- Peer reviews in Academia
- Team feedback
- Root cause analysis
- Mentoring 
- etc


The main difference between dialectics and Socratic dialectics is that the latter has timeless principles in mind that are aligned with the universe or are dharmic. 

Academia, organized teams, mentors, companies might not have their mentalities aligned with the true nature of things. In such cases, they use dialectics to align others into their own mentality. 

For example:
- academic journals accept only the papers that match their beliefs, which shows their mentality.
- Japanese companies accept the work and leadership styles that match Japanese culture over foreign cultures.


<!-- Nowadays, this manifests as peer reviews where new theories and interpretations are filtered out by senior academics* who are supposed to have a better grasp of principles.  

{{< f f="*In contrast to scientific peer reviews where the academic is a master of material principles, dialectical peer reviews are done by senior metaphysicians (dialecticians) who have a solid grasp of both Eastern and Western metaphysics. Unlike the academic who is verified by a man-made PhD, the seniority of a Socratic dialectician is verified by his track record of predicting things correctly (ideas matching reality)." >}} -->



You could say that:
- Dialectics is from the perspective of the limited self
- Socratic Dialectics is from the perspective of the Universe or Existence or the Totality of Selves (which the self is a part of). The Hindus call this totality as Brahma.


<!-- - Critical thinking is the application of the intellect with added effort in order to push against, or break through, the limitations imposed by the Negative Force
- Critical feeling is the application of the feelings with added effort in order to go outside of the ego or the feeling of the self which is also a result of the Negative Force

These two are used to solve problems. 
- Critical thinking is usually for intellectual and physical problems
- Critical feeling is usually for social and psychological ones
 -->

Superphysics solves these isolated or siloed mentalities by applying Socartic dialectics from a mentality that is truly aligned with Nature.


## Dharma versus Tao versus tao

"Dharma" is the passive version. An analogy is source code before it is deployed.

"The Tao" is the active 'flowing' version. An analogy is the logic in the app after it is deployed or is online.

Both have reference to metaphysical causes or the Supreme Entity. 
- "dharma" and "tao" are the ordinary version in nature. 

Similarly, 'True Nature' is anchored in something Divine and invisible, while 'nature' is what is ordinarily inherent.

Problems begin when something does not keep in line with its nature. For example:
- loading a pickup truck with 2 tons when it was only designed for 1 ton will cause problems
- eating too much too fast will lead to stomach problems
- installing an app that requires 2GB RAM on a device with only 1GB RAM will lead to errors


Superphysics aims to solve real-world problems by using Socratic Dialectics:
- to probe the true nature, dharma, or tao of the elements of the problem
- to trace the events or circumstances that caused those elements to veer off of its nature  
- to suggest ways to get back to that 'natural' or proper state


## Probing with Socratic Dialectics

This Dharma, Tao, or True Nature itself resides in the invisible metaphysical domain of ideas and feelings. 

You cannot see your ideas and feelings. Instead, you can make them 'real' in the physical domain by expressing them physically:
- speaking
- drawing
- acting out 
- writing, etc  


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 7, Chapter 4" >}}
Dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle. It is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure. By her gentle aid, she lifts up the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough. She uses as handmaids and helpers the sciences in the work of conversion. Custom calls them sciences. But they should have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science. We called this "understanding".

## The Socratic Dialogue as Relationality Implemented

Probing is done by:
- back-and-forth dialogue for living organisms
- trial and error for non-living organisms

For example, we probe:
- a rock by tapping it with a metal rod
- a body of water by dipping our feet in
- a fruit by pressing it with our fingers
- our spouse by asking where he or she went last night 

This exposes the relationality between the 'prober' and the 'probee'.  

<!-- Cartesian Relationality is a key concept in Superphysics which focuses on the relation or relativity between 2 identities.  -->

<!-- This relationality is the effect of the differences or similarities between the gravitational signature or dharma of 2 identities. 

Identities interact with each other because they have some wave in common. For example, in our physical reality, every single thing that we experience has some physicality coded in one of its many waves, since every identity is a compound idea. 

This means there are other perceptions that we cannot have because they do not have physicality in their waves. 

The fact that things come into our perception means that they have some thing in common with us and our own bunch of waves. 

We know how such things are related to us by observing them. We call this passively getting the waves from that identity. 

The problem is that some waves are deep and need effort to be revealed. Ths is where probing comes into the picture. -->


These probing actions inject contact or impact between us with the other identity or object. 
- This then evokes an action or feedback from it. 

<!-- This contact then creates a feedback to our own minds that creates am aethereal relation between us and the identity.  -->

For physical things, we use physical objects like a metal rod, our feet and fingers. 

For metaphysical things such as souls, we use our own souls. For example, we talk to a person to get feedback from his mind or soul. 

If we try to talk to a rock, we will not get any feedback because the soul of the rock is undeveloped and cannot make independent expressions. 

So talking to another man lets us build the relation between him and our own soul. We can probe this relation better if we ask him questions.

## Built to Solve Problems

Unlike spiritual theories which are often useless, Socratic Dialectics is meant to solve real world problems. This makes it more in line with science and technology than philosophy. 

{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic by Plato Simplified, Book 7, Chapter 4" >}}
The Pythagoreans who have enquired about harmony are as wrong as the astronomers.
They investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard. But they never apply them to problems. They never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others are not.. Their pursuit will be valuable for our objects if all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and connection with one another and become considered in their mutual affinities. Until then, there is no profit in pursuing them.
