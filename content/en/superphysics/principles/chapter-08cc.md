The previous section explained that the thinking process uses flow and force, with emphasis on force. 

The goal of thinking is knowledge which the mind achieves through intuition, cognition, or realization. 

Knowledge, intuition, cognition, or realization are all effects of the Positive Force just as Ignorance and stupidity are effects of the Negative. 
- The former are based on the Hgher Mind, just as the latter are based on the Lower Mind blocking off access to the Higher Mind through the Negative Force 


## Logic, Reasoning, Syllogism, Mathematics

Logic is the connection of ideas. 

Reasoning is the use of logic to explain cause and effect in general.

Induction is reasoning from the individual ideas that make up a compound idea or concept in order to get the whole picture or understanding of it

Deduction is reasoning from the structure of the compound idea into its component ideas in order to get the whole picture or understanding of a concept or thesis

Syllogisms are ideas used to aid the deductive reasoning method as guideposts and direction signs to control the traffic or flow of cognition. 


The experience of physical cause and effect leads the mind to invent logic which is the mind viewing itself  

This leads to the invention of logic as a form of study, just as our experience of pain and pleasure from actions leads to the invention of ethics. 

We can say that:
- logic and intellect are effects of the physical domain
- friendship and fellow-feeling are effects of the metaphysical


## Critical Thinking

Usually, we use logic and our intellect whenever we need to solve a problem. 

For example, when want to go to a certain place, we check the map so we can trace a logical path towards it and use our intellect to find the most efficient or least expensive or fastest way to get there. 

If we were omniscient, we would be able to reach our destination without using any map. However, in reality, our intellect is limited and obstructed by the Negative Force.

 <!-- as opposition to our desire, from the Positive Force, for that destination.  -->

And so not all of us reach our destination in the perfect way that we planned.

**Ordinary thinking is the application of intellect in the ordinary way within this limitation.** 

We can say that critical thinking is the application of intellect with an added effort to push against or break through such limitation. This is why it is commonly called out-of-the-box thinking. It happens when we apply more energy or effort in our thinking process. 

Critical thinking is done by the brain. 




There are 2 ways of teaching: by Syllogism and by Induction.

Induction is the source of universal propositions.

Syllogism reasons from these universals.

Syllogism then may reason from principles which cannot be themselves proved Syllogistically: and therefore must by Induction.

So Knowledge is “a state or mental faculty apt to demonstrate syllogistically,” etc. as in the Analytics[13].
