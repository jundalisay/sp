## Space Leads to Exclusion

This property of uniqueness manifests as unique frequency in a wave-based Existence. When imagined in the physical domain, this wave-frequency becomes a spin. 

This is because the Air Element creates discrete space and time. The identity in question matches this discreteness by converting frequency, which is not easily perceptible, into spin, which is more easily perceived.

Identities in space preserve their uniqueness by preventing other identites from occupying their space. We call such exclusion space as the aetherspace which will be explained by Material Superphysics.

This exclusion space is known in Physics as the Exclusion Principle. 

{{< q a="Wolfgang Pauli" c="Exclusion Principle and Quantum Mechanics" >}}
An entirely non-degenerate energy level is already 'closed' if it is occupied by a single electron. States in contradiction with this are excluded.

## Uniqueness Leads to Relational Action and a Dynamic Universe

The differences in the spin of identities leads to various degrees of cohesion or repulsion just like gears that go together or grind against each other.

{{< i s="/graphics/physics/gears.gif" a="Gears" c="Opposing gears work together, similar gears clash" >}}


Thus, the inherent frequency of each identity leads to a physical spin in space as its inherent action. 

When these actions hit, impact, or contact the actions of other identities, these become **relational actions**.

Therefore, the relational actions are caused by the inherent natural differences between identities. 

Since all identities are unique, then there is always movement in the universe -- Existence, as the Supreme Entity, is always in inherent motion. 

Only the Absolute Entity has zero motion because it is One, and has nothing else to relate to. 


This inherent dynamism is what we call change, movement, and evolution.

For example, suppose you have a tray that can only hold 10 apples. 

{{< img src="/photos/objects/apples2.jpg" alt="Apples" >}}

Adding more apples will either:
- make those additional apples fall off if the tray is strong, or
- make the apples in the tray burst out if the tray is weak. 

Either way, the mere addition of apples causes movement, as a reaction to those new additions.

The tray represents the mind of the universe or reality which holds its ideas. The addition of new ideas, from other universes or realities, creates reactions from the already-existing ideas. 

This leads to movement for those new and old ideas inside the container of the universe or reality.

This movement affects all ideas in that universe or reality, just as the addition of the apple affects all apples already in the tray -- the more ideas, the more the dynamism and energy.

 <!-- dynamism that is far more energetic than the original addition-action.   -->

From here it follows that:
- the universe is inherently dynamic
- there is an inherent potential dynamism in each object 
- an object's dynamism can be tapped by letting it interact with the proper objects other than itself
- the dynamism of objects depend on their relations with each other

<!-- This is the foundation of our **Theory of Dynamism**.  -->

This dynamism is inherent in the Aether Element which is closest to the Absolute. It manifests in the Physical Domain through the Air Element (Space and Time) which serves as the agent of the aether. 

This is why Superphysics shallowly interchanges the word 'aether' with the medium of space, time, and forces. 

This is similar to Physics using 'electroweak' as the unity of the weak interaction and electromagnetism.


## So What's The Use of Inherent Action and Relational Action?

In its basic form, inherent action explains where things get their energy from, whether from the Aether, Air, Fire, Water, or Earth Elements. 


This can then be used to cancel physical and metaphysical staticity, lack of power, idleness, boredom.

For example:

The theory of dynamism can be applied in the different sciences as follows.

Science | Effect of theory of dynamism
--- | ---
Physics | Empty space is full of energy, leading to free energy.
Psychology | Inspiration is everywhere in space, leading to free inspiration energy to continue one's endeavours and movements
Biology | Evolution is movement to adapt to the environment, sourced from willpower
Medicine | Movement from disease to health
Politics | Movement from war to peace
Economics | Movement from poverty to prosperity


At least, in theory, dynamism makes suicide obsolete since Negative static energy can changed into Positive dynamic energy for continuing life. Entities that are meant to end physical life prematurely before old age will naturally die by external accidents according to karma to be explained next.
