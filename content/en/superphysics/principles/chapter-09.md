<!--  main job of the intellectual mind is to think about its ideas.
- The act of thinking is the perception and connection of ideas  

The main job of the emotional mind is to discern its feelings.
- The act of feeling is the perception and immersion of feelings -->



Chapter 1f explained that:
- the universe has a wave-nature
- waves manifest as feelings
- nodes of waves manifest as ideas


Feelings manifest as:
- forces when interacting with crude nodes
- emotions when interacting with subtle nodes

{{< img src="/photos/psych/freedom.jpg" alt="Freedom woman" >}}

We cannot quantify forces at first sight unlike objects. For example, we see 3 apples and can declare the number 3. But we cannot easily say their weight by just our hands.

Material Superphysics explains that:
- the sight of the apples is from their aetherspace which is static
- the feeling of the weight of the apples is from the space particles which are constantly flowing


Thus, feelings and forces are hard to quantify and to objectively standardize since they are dynamics waves. 

Ideas, on the other hand, are easy to define and quantify and standardize into belief systems



## Feelings are Superior to Intellect

This makes the control of the intellect easier to develop, than the control of the feelings.

- The intellect or brain is our detector and manager for our ideas
- The heart is our detector and manager for our feelings

<!-- The perception of idea and experience are both done by the intellect. 

However, the movement from idea to experience are powered by desire. Without desire, idea and experience would never meet and loops will never close. This would be like being ignorant or staring at blankness forever. 

Desire is a fundamental kind of feeling which we sense through our hearts. We can say that:
- the intellect is our built-in sensor for ideas 
- the heart is our built-in sensor for feelings 

Ideas can be represented by accurately physical objects. For example, the idea of Covid is universally represented by the physical SARS-COV2 virus. 

However, feelings cannot be universally represented by objects. For example, the feeling of freedom has been represented by:
- a flying bird, 
- broken chains, or
- a person with open arms.  -->


## Inward Feelings Versus Outward Emotions

The word "feeling" comes from the Old English "felan" which means "to touch or have a sensory experience of something". 
- Since feelings are aethereal waves, then feelings are waves going inwards to the mind. 

The Latin word "emovere" which is a combination of "e-" (variant of ex- ) meaning "out" and "movere", meaning "move". 
- This implies an outward movement or expression. 

We can think of emotions as feelings that have been processed by the perceiver according to his gravitational signature or personality configuration.
- Emotions are therefore subjectivized feelings just as knowledge is subjectified thoughts. 


{{< img src="/graphics/psych/feelings.jpg" alt="Feelings into Emotion" cap="Feelings turn into personal emotion due to one's gravitational signature" >}}

Emotions are more commonly seen in the items that we personalize, such as our clothes, computer desktop, office workspace, bedroom, personal vehicles, etc. 

These customizations express our gravitational signature to the outside world and validates our personality structure.



## The Emotions of Matter

Feelings pervade existence and are also 'felt' by non-living things, such as rocks and ice. 

A high amount of heat makes:
- a rock turn redder
- ice might melt and evaporate

We can say that the red color and the evaporation are the expressed emotions of the rock and ice, respectively. This is consistent with the assertion in Chapter 8a that the physical universe is alive.

<!-- This will be explained more in Chapter 7.     -->

{{< img src="/graphics/psych/feelings2.jpg" alt="Feelings into Emotion for Rocks and Water" cap="Feelings are expressed by non living objects in very limited ways. A rock shows its emotions on perceiving heat by turning more red, while water shows it by turning into steam" >}}


<!-- Chapter 2 explained that the metapyhsical domain is superior to the physical domain. Therefore the heart is superior to the brain. 
- This is proven by successful people having more (metaphysical) grit than people who had high grades in school. 
- World leaders, such as Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un, are known for grit but not for intellect. 

The intellect is just the connection of ideas. But it is the feelings that powers the desire, not only to connect ideas, but to expand the scope of the intellect.  

Superphysics asserts that while non-living things do not show intellect, they do show emotion by the way they react to physical phenomena. Unlike living beings that use the heart to process emotions, non-living things use the Radiant Layer directly, as ELectromagnetism. THe most obvious feelings that non-living things react to are those of heat and cold.

## Superphysics Closes the Gap Between Intellect and Feelings

Human hearts lead us to errors because the Western educational system, spread globally through colonization, has focused on brain development and not on heart development. This leads to:
- physicists using their intellect to create nuclear weapons
- the recommendations of intelligent climate scientists being ignored
- mathematicians using their intellect to game the stock market

<!-- The odd quirk in the human species is that our brain and heart are far apart. This creates a distance or lag that makes ideas  appear totally different from feelings. This then makes human action lack feelings for others, as seen in terrorism, nuclear weapons, deforestation, etc.  -->

To push for heart development, and the increase in common-interest and fellow-feeling, Superphysics proposes to close the distance between the brain and the heart by visualizing* feelings. This is because sight is the main sensor of the brain.


{{< img src="/graphics/super/cartesian.png" cap="Physics visualizes physical movement, Superphysics visualizes metaphysical (aethereal) movement" alt="Visualization of the feelings" >}}

Humans already do this through TV, movies, powerpoint presentations, branding, packaging, advertising and other bright, shiny, catchy, fragrant, and tasty things that appeal to the senses located near the brain as the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue.   

This visualization of ideas and feelings will then prove our proposed Law of Conservation of Idea which is the metaphysical foundation of the concept of dharma. <!-- physical Law of Conservation of Matter and Energy.  -->


## Critical Thinking and Critical Feeling

In order to maximize our experience of existence, it would best to have both sensors running at 100%, as much as possible. This means they should not just be passively sensing, but also **actively sensing**. 

This active sensing is the foundation of critical thinking (as intellect), as well as critical feeling (as kindness and fellow-feeling).

Currently, the educational systems in most countries mostly focus on intellect and is very deficient in fellow-feeling. This is proven by the prevalence of racism, terrorism, poverty & inequality, materialism, environmental destruction, etc. 

The glaring proof is the existence of mass shootings by young people in the West. It shows that their educational or cultural systems nurtured hate and division instead of fellow-feeling and unity. This problem does not exist so much in Asian* education or culture.   


{{< n n="*Instead of personal divisions, Asia has religious divisions that create religious conflict such as that between Hindus and Muslims in India, Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar, and Falun Gong versus the Chinese Communist Party. In Africa, the divisions are even more basic as being based on tribal lines, such as those seen in Rwanda, Sudan, and Ethiopia." >}}



Globally, this lack of fellow-feeling hurts even the intellectual sciences. For example, scientists have long had the data to prove that global warming causes disasters. Yet the feelings of the human species are extremely disunited, unable to drive collective action. 

The mere visualization or even 'audification' of feelings will not be enough to increase fellow-feeling. To deal with such large-scale non-feeling, Superphysics proposes many new concepts such as:
- Qualimath
- Constitutional Virtues
- 5 Interconnectivities
- 5 Layers of Medicine
- 4 Laws of Value
- 4 Social Cycles
- Points-based economy
- etc.


These unify the feelings of each person so that each one will discover his role in the greater plan of the universe, and appreciate the hidden value in the existence of each.

A skilled craftsman makes a perfect creation as a whole, even if its parts taken individually seem imperfect.

Is the plan of the universe in line with what we feel? 

This is answered by our intuition and conscience. 
- Intuition is the detection of the aether
- Conscience is the intuition or feeling for the dharma or true nature



## The Operations of Feeling

Attraction is the tendency to move towards an object. 

Its related oprations are:
- Love
- Friendship
- Cooperation
- Society
- Buying
- Arriving
- Marriage or Being a couple
- etc


Repulsion is the tendency to move away an object. 

- Hate
- Animosity
- War
- Isolation
- Selling
- Leaving
- Divorce or Breaking up
- etc

### Usefulness of Combinative and Separative

All the operations of thinking and feeling<!-- mind, through the intellect and feelings, --> thus fall into those 2 categories. This categorization is very useful for understanding the root cause of mental problems. 

For example, Modern psychology detaches the intellect from the heart when dealing with memory problems such as dementia or Alzheimer's. This makes its cause unknown. 

However, with our combined model, we point out that intellectual memory loss is separative action of the mind, as forgetting. The solution is to counteract this intellectual separative action with a combinative feeling action (since feelings are superior to intellect).

This manifests as people having better social bonds. This is why positive social interaction is essential to avoid Alzheimer's and other mental diseases.     

This categorization system also works for Physics as artificial intelligence or AI. 

For example, Physicists are unable to create real AI because they neglect the feeling aspect. We solve this by adding social interaction data as part of the training data for our proposed Artificial Sentience system called ISAIAH.

<!-- The separation of memory from remembering is useful in:
- Bio Superphysics for memory problems, dementia, and
- Material Superphysics for the creation of artificial sentience. -->

<!-- For example, the interplay of desire, mind-memory, and consciousness explains why  -->


## Remembering, Learning, and Expanding

The other abilities of the mind can be explained in Bio Superphysics. 

The next chapter will explain the layers of the mind, as the layers of the universe.
