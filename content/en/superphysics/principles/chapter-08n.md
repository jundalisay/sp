The previous sections explained that Socratic Dialectics exhaustively probes a thing or issue for data in order to reveal the True Nature of that thing or issue. 

This data is then put into a table that has the model, as attributes and relatins of the data, that conforms to the principles of Superphysics. 

We call this a Francis Bacon table. 

1. Table of Existence and Presence

This is the training data

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Book 2, Aphorism 11" >}}
The investigation of forms proceeds thus from a given nature, we first present to the understanding all the known instances which agree in the same nature, even if the subject matter is considerably diversified. This collection must be made as a mere history, without any premature reflection.
{{< /q >}}


2. Table of Deviation or Absence in Proximity 

This filters out the data

{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Book 2, Aphorism 12" >}}
We then list instances which do not admit of the given nature. This is because form should:
- be absent where the given nature is absent
- be present where it is present
{{< /q >}}


3. Table of Degrees or Comparison

This applies weights and relationships


{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Nova Organum, Book 2, Chapter 5">}}
We learn about the nature of an object by comparing the increase and decrease of that nature in the same object, or its degree in different objects. It follows that a thing's essence is that which uniformly diminishes and increases with the given nature. This comparison is our "Table of Degrees" or Comparative Instances.
{{< /q >}}



4. The Vintage

This is the model that is formed from the tables


{{< q a="Francis Bacon" c="Book 2, Aphorism 20" >}}
The form of anything is inherent in each individual instance
{{< /q >}}

<!-- Table of Instances -->



## Example 

<!-- of   How We Apply Socratic Dialectics -->

We use the Socratic dialectical approach and the scientific approach to solve Covid symptoms.

Scientific Approach | Dialectical Approach
--- | ---
1 Note down the symptoms | 1. Note down the symptoms
2 Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Western Medicine | 2. Test the drugs or treatmens suggested by Western Medicine
_ | 3. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Naturopathy
_ | 4. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Ayurveda
_ | 5. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Traditional Chinese Medicine
_ | 6. Test the drugs or treatments suggested by Homeopathy
_ | 7. Know the principles of each medical paradigm and find patterns to find out which paradigm deals best with Covid 19


{{< q a="Socrates" c="The Republic Simplified, Book 7, Chapter 4" >}}
The science of harmony, is a laborious study and this is why we should learn it. It will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight of our own higher object.
{{< /q >}}


Notice how the Socratic dialectical approach is more laborious and lengthy than the scientific approach. This is evident in Socratic dialogues which are made very long by the dialectician expounding on every minor topic in order to reveal its true nature, which will in turn reveal the true nature of the bigger picture.


<!-- This laborious method produces a huge dataset that is similar to the "table of existence and presence" described by Francis Bacon:
{{< q a="Francis Bacon" >}}
For instance, take the investigation of the form of heat. Instances agreeing in the Form of Heat:
1. The rays of the sun, particularly in summer, and at noon.
2. The same reflected and condensed, as between mountains, or along walls, and particularly in burning mirrors.
3. Ignited meteors.
4. Burning lightning.
5. Eruptions of flames from the cavities of mountains, etc.
6. Flame of every kind.
...
28. Other instances.
This is a **table of existence and presence**
{{< /q >}} -->


<!-- To make dialectics less laborious, we apply machine learning algorithms in order to extract new ideas which will then lead into a new table with the 'noise' removed. That new table will then lead to better ideas which will form a better table. That table is ran through the algorithm again until the effect matches the principles. 

This collection of tables, when constantly compared with new perceptions, will lead to a dynamic thinking process which we call **Artificial Sentience**. This is different from Aritifical Intelligence which is limited to a closed set of data. 

To explain artificial sentience, we must first explain how dialectical truths are different from scientific truths. This will be done in the next subchapter.  -->

These Francis Bacon tables are similar to the process used by machine learning. 

We combine machine learning with the cycle of cognition to come explain neural networks.

We then combine neural networks with the aether to explain autonomous natural intelligence, as true AI.
