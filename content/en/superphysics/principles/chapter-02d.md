<!-- ## The Radiant Layer (Electromagnetism) -->


This element handles information and 'energy'.

This most commonly is seen as light and felt as heat. 

Light is responsible for color-information. We perceive and learn mostly through our eyes. This proves the importance of the Fire Element for perception.

Magnetism is sourced from the Air Element but is facilitated by the Fire Element through virtual photons and electrons. 

In Bio Superphysics, in relationships, the Fire Element is the origin of the heat of passion. Hot climates lead to increased sexual activity of the Water Element because the Fire Element is superior to Water. 

Sexual activity is reduced by separating male and female as adding space which is of the Air Element since Air is superior to both Fire and Water.

In Spiritual Superphysics, the Fire Element is the basis for the aura. It gives information to others on what feelings or general ideas an entity has to those who are sensitive enough to detect auras.
