Chapter 1 explained that Existence was generated to reflect the value of the Absolute onto Itself.  

In Physics, reflection is the light-wave going back to be absorbed by the source of that light. 

In Hinduism, this is called **yoga** and is the goal of Spiritual Superphysics to solve the "problem" of Existence.


As mentioned in Chapter 6b, the cognition of the dynamism of the universe makes suicide obsolete.

Humans usually commit suicide as a false solution to existential crisis or extreme life problems.

However, since the problem is caused by the Negative Force and suicide is a negative action, then it merely increases the negativity.

This adds crude waves that funnels the soul into a worse physical reality. 

If so why do some Buddhist monks and Hindu sadhus commit suicide by burning or starving themselves?

{{< i s="/photos/social/burn.jpg" a="Burn" >}}
  
We answer that religious dogma creates cultural problems that prevents the mind from flowing in a natural course. 

In the Buddhist case, the imposition of blind non-violence robs the mind of ways to fight back against oppressive policies.
- This makes the monk's mind flow into the idea of suicide as a vent or workaround

In the Hindu case, the imposition of renunciation of the material world robs the mind of ways to realize the Supreme through materialism. 
- This makes the sadhu's mind flow into the idea of starvation which is consistent with Hindu belief.

The self-immolation protests in Vietnam in the 1960s and those in Tibet in the 2010s did not lead to the betterment of their social or religious situation.
- The Buddhist self-immolation protests in Vietnam against Catholic policies created to instability which allowed Communist victory which reduced Buddhism in Vietnam 
- The Buddhist self-immolation protests in Tibet against Chinese policies did not change Communist policy suppressing Buddhism


As such, we cannot say that such forms of Buddhist and Hindu interpretation are valid natural ways to realize the Supreme. 

Instead, of specific religions, we come up with 4 paths to yoga which is consistent with the 4 paths in the Bhagavad Gita. 




Paradigm | Pre-Existence (Probability) | Existence (Matrix or Mind)
--- | --- | ---
Superphysics | Absolute Entity | Supreme Entity
Ancient Greek | The One | The Whole or The Other
Hindus | Nirguna Brahma | Saguna Brahma
Buddhists | Sunya | Brahma 
Taoism | Tao | tao 
Essassani | The One | All There Is



Notice how our classification is existence-based, being divided into:

1. The Probability of Existence
2. Actual Existence 


This is very different from the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh, Allah, and even the Polythesist Tara, Quan Yin, Kali, Ganesh, etc who are classified according to the feelings of the people who invented them:

- The Jewish Yahweh is very cruel. This mirrors the cruel environment experienced by the Jews during their journey through the desert
- The Christian God is very forgiving and generous. This mirrors the feelings of Jews under the wealthy Romans 
- The Islamic Allah is very commanding. This mirrors the feelings of Arabs rallying the tribes against the Byzantines and Persians.


## God as the Anunnaki

The only way to explain the weirdness of the Judeo-Christian God is to connect it to the **Anunnaki** which is the alien species that created humans. This connects the Bible, Torah, and Quran to the texts of the Babylonians and Sumerians, since reality is a continuous wave. 

The Anunnaki are physical beings and so are Negative, and has already been explained by both the ancient Sumerian texts and the ['modern' Essassani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji9rMw37o2M).

To get a true view of the Supreme (separate from physical aliens), we follow the 'critical feeling' techniques of Buddhism and Hinduism of catching and isolating our feelings.

This allows us to:
- see Existence in Its true form, without the bias of feeling
- classify these descriptions of the Supreme as either Positive or Negative.

## The Absolute Entity

We create the concept of the **Absolute Entity** in order to explain the nature of Probability of Existence. 

We can think of the Absolute Entity as the **Supreme Entity** in passive or pre-existing form. 
<!-- It is the only entity that does not move is the entity that created the ideas, minds, and feelings in the Universe. -->
- The Ancient Greeks call it *The One*
- Hindus call it *Nirguna Brahma*
- Buddhists call it *Sunya* or *Void*

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Part 8" >}}
The believers of The One say that The One is the cause of substance [aether]. 
{{< /q >}}


## The Supreme Entity

The Supreme is biased towards creation. This bias comes in the form of the *Positive Force* slightly dominating the Negative Force in the long run.

- The Positive (Yang in Taoism) keeps our universe in Existence. If the Positive had no Negative, then existence would be static and unchanging. 
- The Negative (Yin in Taoism) keeps that Existence dynamic. If the Negative had no Positive, then there would be no persistence in existence. 

 <!-- which then leads to the constant existence and dynamism of our universe.      -->

The Absolute is beyond the Positive or Negative and consequently does not care or is not affected by them. It is the Supreme that 'cares' for Existence or Itself.
