Chapter 1 explained that Existence was generated to reflect the value of the Absolute onto Itself.  


## Yoga Versus the Dogma in Eastern and Western Religions

In Physics, reflection is the light-wave going back to be absorbed by the source of that light. 

In Hinduism, this is called **yoga** and is the goal of Spiritual Superphysics to solve the "problem" of Existence.


As mentioned in Chapter 6b, the cognition of the dynamism of the universe makes suicide obsolete.

Humans usually commit suicide as a false solution to existential crisis or extreme life problems.

However, since the problem is caused by the Negative Force and suicide is a negative action, then it merely increases the negativity.

This adds crude waves that funnels the soul into a worse physical reality. 


### Dogma in Buddhism and Hinduism

If so why do some Buddhist monks and Hindu sadhus commit suicide by burning or starving themselves?

{{< i s="/photos/social/burn.jpg" a="Burn" >}}
  
We answer that religious dogma creates cultural problems that prevents the mind from flowing in a natural course. 

- In the Buddhist case, the imposition of blind non-violence robs the mind of ways to fight back against oppressive policies. This makes the monk's mind flow into the idea of suicide as a vent or workaround
- In the Hindu case, the imposition of renunciation of the material world robs the mind of ways to realize the Supreme through materialism. This makes the sadhu's mind flow into the idea of starvation which is consistent with Hindu belief.

The self-immolation protests in Vietnam in the 1960s and those in Tibet in the 2010s did not lead to the betterment of their social or religious situation.
- The Buddhist self-immolation protests in Vietnam against Catholic policies created to instability which allowed Communist victory which reduced Buddhism in Vietnam 
- The Buddhist self-immolation protests in Tibet against Chinese policies did not change Communist policy suppressing Buddhism


As such, we cannot say that such forms of Buddhist and Hindu interpretation are valid natural ways to realize the Supreme. What about the Western and Middle Eastern religions?


### Dogma in Christianity and Islam

The solution of Christanity to existential problems is to accept Jesus, with the belief that doing so will magically end the problem and bring one's soul to heaven after death.

{{< q a="John" c="The Bible, John 3:16" >}}
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
{{< /q >}}

The effects of Christianity has been colonization, which uses religion to make the colonies subservient to the colonizer. This is because the Christianity is an invention of the Roman Empire. 

{{< q a="Antonio de Morga" c="Events in the Philippine Islands, Chapter 6" >}}
Our pilot, Francisco de Sanda, had shown Ximonojo the sea-chart of all the countries discovered by Spain. Ximonojo asked him how those distant kingdoms were gained. The pilot replied that the religious had entered first and preached their religion. Then the soldiers had followed and subdued them. So Ximonojo told the Taiko [Toyotomi Hideyoshi] that the Spaniards conquered by first sending their religious to the kingdoms then entering after with their arms. They would do this with Japan.. All this angered the Taiko thoroughly.

The solution of Islam to existential problems is to submit to Allah and Islamic law, with the belief that doing so will give them ease in this life and rewards in the afterlife.

{{< q a="Mohammad" c="Quran, Surah At-Talaq 65:3" >}}
Whoever relies on Allah, then He is sufficient for him. Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a decreed extent.
{{< /q >}}


The effects of Islam are very inconsistent, with Arabian countries prospering with oil wealth, while Gaza and Yemen are suffering with genocide and civil war. Moreover, the harsh policies of Islam have been associated with terrorism. 


<!-- This is very different from the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh, Allah, and even the Polythesist Tara, Quan Yin, Kali, Ganesh, etc who are classified according to the feelings of the people who invented them:

- The Jewish Yahweh is very cruel. This mirrors the cruel environment experienced by the Jews during their journey through the desert
- The Christian God is very forgiving and generous. This mirrors the feelings of Jews under the wealthy Romans 
- The Islamic Allah is very commanding. This mirrors the feelings of Arabs rallying the tribes against the Byzantines and Persians. -->


## God as the Anunnaki

The only way to explain the weirdness of the Judeo-Christian God is to connect it to the **Anunnaki** which is the alien species that created humans. This connects the Bible, Torah, and Quran to the texts of the Babylonians and Sumerians, since reality is a continuous wave. 

The Anunnaki are physical beings and so are Negative, and has already been explained by both the ancient Sumerian texts and the ['modern' Essassani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji9rMw37o2M).

To get a true view of the Supreme (separate from physical aliens), we follow the 'critical feeling' techniques of Buddhism and Hinduism of catching and isolating our feelings.

This allows us to:
- see Existence in Its true form, without the bias of feeling
- classify these descriptions of the Supreme as either Positive or Negative.
