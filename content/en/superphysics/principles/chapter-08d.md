The previous section explained "paranormal" life forms such as:
- elementals, including viruses, that need to infest organisms to express themselves
- aliens, as organisms that did not evolve from Earth 
- spirits, as metaphysical minds

The infinite and eternal nature of the universe, along with the principles of life and the Positive Force, show logically that life can exist in so many places in the galaxy and in the universe.

In the physical domain, "intelligent" life is more rare than non-intelligent life because physicality is where the Negative Force dominates. 

As beings evolve into the metaphysical domain which is the domain of the Positive, the volume of intelligence increases until omniscience is achieved at the level of the Supreme Entity. 


  
Paradigm | Pre-Existence (Probability) | Existence (Matrix or Mind)
--- | --- | ---
Superphysics | Absolute Entity | Supreme Entity
Ancient Greek | The One | The Whole or The Other
Hindus | Nirguna Brahma | Saguna Brahma
Buddhists | Sunya | Brahma 
Taoism | Tao | tao 
Essassani | The One | All There Is



Notice how our classification is existence-based, being divided into:

1. The Probability of Existence
2. Actual Existence 


This is very different from the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh, Allah, and even the Polythesist Tara, Quan Yin, Kali, Ganesh, etc who are classified according to the feelings of the people who invented them:

- The Jewish Yahweh is very cruel. This mirrors the cruel environment experienced by the Jews during their journey through the desert
- The Christian God is very forgiving and generous. This mirrors the feelings of Jews under the wealthy Romans 
- The Islamic Allah is very commanding. This mirrors the feelings of Arabs rallying the tribes against the Byzantines and Persians.


## God as the Anunnaki

The only way to explain the weirdness of the Judeo-Christian God is to connect it to the **Anunnaki** which is the alien species that created humans. This connects the Bible, Torah, and Quran to the texts of the Babylonians and Sumerians, since reality is a continuous wave. 

The Anunnaki are physical beings and so are Negative, and has already been explained by both the ancient Sumerian texts and the ['modern' Essassani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji9rMw37o2M).

To get a true view of the Supreme (separate from physical aliens), we follow the 'critical feeling' techniques of Buddhism and Hinduism of catching and isolating our feelings.

This allows us to:
- see Existence in Its true form, without the bias of feeling
- classify these descriptions of the Supreme as either Positive or Negative.

## The Absolute Entity

We create the concept of the **Absolute Entity** in order to explain the nature of Probability of Existence. 

We can think of the Absolute Entity as the **Supreme Entity** in passive or pre-existing form. 
<!-- It is the only entity that does not move is the entity that created the ideas, minds, and feelings in the Universe. -->
- The Ancient Greeks call it *The One*
- Hindus call it *Nirguna Brahma*
- Buddhists call it *Sunya* or *Void*

{{< q a="Aristotle" c="The Metaphysics by Aristotle Simplifed, Book 1, Part 8" >}}
The believers of The One say that The One is the cause of substance [aether]. 
{{< /q >}}


## The Supreme Entity

The Supreme is biased towards creation. This bias comes in the form of the *Positive Force* slightly dominating the Negative Force in the long run.

- The Positive (Yang in Taoism) keeps our universe in Existence. If the Positive had no Negative, then existence would be static and unchanging. 
- The Negative (Yin in Taoism) keeps that Existence dynamic. If the Negative had no Positive, then there would be no persistence in existence. 

 <!-- which then leads to the constant existence and dynamism of our universe.      -->

The Absolute is beyond the Positive or Negative and consequently does not care or is not affected by them. It is the Supreme that 'cares' for Existence or Itself.
