Spiritual Superphysics uses 'strata' instead of 'elements' for the 5 factors in the spiritual field.

This is because spirituality is purely mental or metaphysical and has no physical components. 

In contrast:
- the 5 layers are for physical phenomena
- the 5 elements are for semi-physical, semi-mental phenomena


Strata | Manifestations
--- | ---
Aethereal | Soul, Oversoul, Idea
Spatial | Chi/Prana/Animal Spirits, Chakras
Radiant | Elementals
Convertible | Feelings 
Material | Thoughts



<!-- Level of Mind | Behavior | Layer | Chakra
--- | --- | --- | --- 
10. Unstable goatish mind | driven by instincts | Material | Root
9. Foolish abstinent mind | strives to be moral | Convertible | Sex
8. Childlike fearless mind | seeks to believe in an eternally unchanging god | Convertible | Sex
7. Mind of selfless aggregates | seeks personal liberation | Radiant | Navel 
6. Mind free of karmic seeds | understands the process of conditioning | Spatial | Heart
5. Compassionate mahayana mind | has great compassion as it sees the consciousness in nature | Spatial | Heart
4. Mind awakened to the Unborn | realizes the void nature | Aethereal | Throat
3. Mind of the single way | realizes that all worlds are contained in a single thought within mind | Aethereal | Ajna
2. Mind of ultimate no-self-nature | penetrates all things but still dualistic | Aethereal | Ajna
1. Secret sublime mind | breaks through duality | Aethereal | Top

<!--  divides reality into the Physical and Metaphysical Domain. This is known to the West as Cartesian duality or mind-body. From the perspective of the Supreme Entity, the Body of the Supreme is made up of physical layers, while His Mind is made up of metaphysical strata:

Aspect | Example
--- | ---
Mind | Life and Living Energy
Body | Matter and Non-living Energy

In other words:
- the physical universe is the collective body of the Supreme
- the living minds in that universe is the collective mind of the Supreme 

While Material Superphysics deals with matter and non-living energy, Bio Superphysics deals with life and living energy which we call chi, prana, or animal spirits. 


We call the Supreme's Mind aspect as the Metaphysical Domain which we subdivide into 5 Strata which is in line with the 5 Layers discussed in Material Superphysics -->
