We reorganized the 4 Rules of Movement to match the 4 properties of waves.


Before | After
--- | ---
1 No Void | 1 No Void 
2 State-Change (Inertia) | 2 Straight or Circular
3 Straight or Circular | 3 Collisions
4 Collisions | 4 State-Change


This makes it match the 4 properties of waves which is seen in the 4 laws of thermodynamics

Property | Rule of Motion
--- | ---
1 Continuous Wavelength | 1 No Void  
2 Spin or Frequency | 2 Straight or Circular
3 Spin strength or Wave Amplitude | 3 Collisions 
4 Forward Movement | 4 State-Change
