Superhysics uses the 5 Elements model of the Ancient Greeks, Hindus, and Taoists. 

For a while, we kept the name "elements", only using "layers" for physical phenomena.

We used Elements for Biological and Mental or Soul phenomena.

However, people still confused elements with the chemical elements. 

So we decided to drop elements and use layers for all 15 elements.

## How We Got Them

We finished the MSQ model for the material world and so we next went to make the MSQ model for the biological world to account for chi and chakras.

For biolgical electrons, I remembered Yogananda's book mentioning lifetrons. 

So while reviewing that, I came upon Sri Yukteswar's [astral dimension](https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2mm7fu/hiranyaloka_the_astral_planet_for_advanced_beings/) and was able to use it to fill the 5 strata into the 5 metaphysical layers.
