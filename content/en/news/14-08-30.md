I realized no academic-economist has read **all** of Adam Smith's works as to understand and absorb all of his ideas. 

Instead, they believe Samuelson's interpretation of Smith, which is really opposite of what Smith was advocating. 

So I started simplifying the entire [Wealth of Nations](/research/smith/wealth-of-nations) this August. 

It took me 1 whole month just to simplify Book 1 word by word, so I assume I can finish the whole thing by December. 

Smith is a terrible writer because he uses very long sentences just like most writers of his time. But the most awful aspect is his use of descriptors or unusual pronouns for the subjects of previous sentences. This made me wonder what he was referring to.
