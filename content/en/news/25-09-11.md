We reorganized:
- Material and Bio Superphysics to be primarily based on the 5 Layers or Strata.
- Social and Spiritual Superphysics to be based on the 4 properties of waves as:
  - 4 social cycles of supersociology 
  - 4 laws of value of supereconomics
  - 4 paths of spirituality 

The 4 paths are:

1. karma
2. raja
3. jnana
4. bhakta

Bio Superphysics emphasizes both 5 strata and 4 stages of life.
